Fullerton,3,“A good hotel that could be great with improved customer service”,"I will start by saying my first impressions of The Fullerton were not great, after spending our two nights at the Marina Bay Sans where the customer service is out of this world! we were a little disappointed...... but it did get better!Wa arrived via taxi, and were greeted by the doorman in a very nice manner, however that's where the nice welcome ended. We both had backpacks on our backs for luggage which no one offered to take for us, we then checked in. While the staff may have not intentionally offended us....they did, at check in we were asked if we could leave a credit card for a deposit (my partners credit card was stolen) so we stated we did not have one. The staff member then said he understood as we look like we can not have one? He also said as we were backpacking we do not need to leave a deposit as he understood it is a lot of money? He then told us we were travelling like people in the military do? again we were both a little off put by this whole conversation and confused. We then carried our own luggage to our room. After this we were apprehensive about staff attitudes at The Fullerton Hotel, but we were proven wrong with wonderful staff at both the concierge desk and the pool on every day of our three night stay. The infinity pool is lovely, with a wonderful view, great bar and food service. Our room was very dark but charming, clean and comfortable with all the trimmings of a 5 star establishment! (TWG tea bags a real bonus for tea lovers)! The building itself is lovely and feels very regal, the courtyard is great place for high tea. A few improvements to make, but overall a good hotel that could be great! Location is the best in the city (i think). Would have given a better rating if not for the poor welcome!",49
Fullerton,3,"“Great place, gotten too expensive....”","Checked in again and enjoyed the stay, but noted that the prices had gone up significantly since I started staying there over the years. It's hard to turn your back on such a great place, but alas it's now time to say good bye - I'm finding alternative accomodation",331

Fullerton,3,“High expectations not Met!”,"We were super excited to stay at The Fullerton for our stop of 3 nights in Singapore. Why excited? well... it is The Fullerton! - Unfortunately overall was just \blah\"".Upon arrival - we were very exhausted after spending time in the airpot for a delayed flight... finally we are at The Fullerton and we thought... \""Thanks God\"" - looking forward to be in our room ASAP - we have booked a \""Courtyard Room\"" without Breakfast... all very CLEAR as we booked-it our selves and we knew about it - with the reservation we kindly requested the possibility of a high floor. - When we arrived I encountered a Receptionist that maybe he didn't know how the computer worked as he was typing so much... and we are waiting, as he types, and we are waiting, as he types and waiting again, and again as he types... wow maybe he was writing to his faraway family to whom he didn't write for very loooong time!.... oh well! - finally he address us with the question - : -Do you know you booked a \""Courtyard Room\""? -Yes I know - I made the reservation - is there a problem? -No, no problem is just that you can receive an upgrade for $$$$ for what I said:-\""No thanks\""....and the receptionist again -\""Do you know you have no breakfast included?\"" -Yes I know - I made the reservation - is there a problem? -No, no problem - is just if you upgrade you can get the breakfast-For what I said: I have business meetings everyday early in the morning and I'll be having breakfast with my colleagues - No, I don't Need breakfast!And again the receptionist:-Well you could still upgrade without the breakfast – would you?Through my mind passed the though of answering “I don’t want your bloody upgrade, I want nothing, get me a taxi and I get the hell out of here to a place where I can be checking-in without the hassle of having being questioned about my reservation and for trying to upsell every single thing available” I felt like in a “car rental” where they try herd to upsell but the staff at The Fullerton went beyond upselling - I deeply took a breath and finally I replied, “Please can you get me my room?” – after another session of typing & typing and typing again in the computer I got into my room – already disappointed upon check-in.Overall – a deception, F&B just average service, they have no idea how to make a Whiskey Sour at the bar – my expectations were not met at this place – next time I will book another property like the St Regis were I should have been since the beginning. – I must say; check-out was a breeze… I guess at check-out no point to waste time with a guess to upsell. Room was large, - but just large, nothing special, just tired, pool was cool, service overall – average.To the GM – stop hassling your guests making your staff upsell & upsell, just improve your services that if your services are great you can get my money on your outlets or additional services – just get your guests to their room ASAP upon arrival.""",275
Fullerton,3,“Faded beauty?”,"I recently stayed for 2 nights during a business trip. Despite the rating, I would use the hotel again due to location to work & the service levels. The rating is based on the fact it's regarded as a 5 star hotel & priced accordingly. This might have been correct 5-10yrs ago, but with new properties at similar prices, I believe the Fullerton is in need of renovation to justify such claims. In summary:Positive1) Quick and friendly check-in and check-out2) Free WIFI, experienced no issues3) Large room (actually too large) and excellent bathroom (also very large). Had all amenities you would expect/need.4) Reasonable gym and nice outdoor pool. Good service at the pool.5) Had buffet dinner one evening for $58, excellent choice and service. Positive experience.6) Impressive entrance and main floor (good meeting area)7) Comfortable bedNegative1) Rooms are faded. They look 10-20yrs old. The room was actually too large, felt cold. 2) Bath had plenty of hot water, shower did not. It had warm water, so no problem having a shower (really large cubicle), but it wasn't so enjoyable as I couldn't get it to be hot.3) Balcony was surrounded by a high brick wall, might as well not have had a balcony. No atmosphere at all.4) The window frame rattled at night, not sure why, but every hour or so it did. Not a problem once asleep.5) Breakfast was $54 as I recall, this is too much for breakfast (especially when considering the room rates).6) Spa. It appears to have multiple awards, but it consists of some massage rooms and a small sauna. Not sure on what basis the awards would have been given.",201
Fullerton,3,“3 Night Stay.”,"The location of this hotel is great. Chose a room with a view over the canal. The foyer and check-in were quite impressive, but the room itself was a little dated. The shelf in the top of the wardrobe wasn't dusted so the clothes I had put on it came out covered in dust and were unwearable. the vanity shelf in the bathroom was also thick with dust, underneath he bed had obviously not been vacuumed for some time as it was thick with dust.We ate at the lighthouse restaurant on Friday evening. The location is lovely and the rooftop bar has fantastic views. I ordered a veal chop for my main course and unfortunately it was terrible. I couldn't eat it. I was offered a tiramisu to make up for it, which I thought was not the best offer ever. However, we got a discount from our bill for the evening which seemed reasonable. There were a couple of other incidents, including being given the snack menu at the rooftop bar after the kitchen had closed and not successfully completing a room service order. However, in general it was a pleasant stay and the building and facilities are generally impressive.",171
Fullerton,3,“Excellent service but I missed some daylight”,"This 5 star hotel is located right in the heart of Singapore and makes walking around so easy. It was my 2nd time to the hotel and unfortunately just as the first time, I got a room without outside window but with a small window on the atrium, meaning you don't have any natural daylight whatsoever. It doesn't matter how big and nice the room was, it makes me depressive not to see daylight when I wake up, so I tried to stay at least as possible in the room and unfortunately the hotel was fully booked, so no room switch was possible. Luckily Breakfast is great and you can actually sit outside, next to the river, which makes a nice change from the gloomy room. The service is also as efficient as can be and wouldn't it be for the daylight less room, I would probably love the place, but I didn't. Also be warned that it comes with a very hefty price tag, and everything consumed is whoppingly expensive.",346
Fullerton,3,"“convenient, but not my favourite”","Over the last year, I've visited S'pore almost on monthly basis and The Fullerton hotel is the first option that I have due to corporate agreement in place.Indeed, it is very convenient for those professionals that work around the financial district since you reach any corporate offices in a short walk, which is good due to warm and humid weather of S'pore.However, there is noting special or something that differentiate the hotel from other 5* in town; actually sometimes they don't pay attention in the details; last week during my check in, the receptionist asked me for my details since they didn't have, however the included me in their loyal programme last year due to the several times that I was there. She didn't realise or even reservation didn't mark as such.As a result, not differentiation in the services or even amenities this time, only normal news paper.Last time, albeit I was upgraded to a better room, it was literally a night mare, since the room was at the front of the building where they have those big globes to light, but the courting in the room didn't cover all window, then the light came straight to the bed - precisely to the pillow - I asked the client service to fix, but they were unable to do anything; they offer the next day to move to another room, at least.Other issue is the building's acoustics, mainly if you stay in the room with view to the atrium; you can listen the the music (good one) very well, but they play until mid night every day, so ...Room service is efficient and breakfast is very good like other similar hotels across Asia; the Italian hotel Light House is very, very good, with fantastic service; perhaps the best part of the hotel.The gym is small, but enough to practice some exercises, whilst the swimming pool has a nice view, but also not too much space.But if you don't have a good deal to stay there (corporate rate), I would consider others such Mandarin Oriental, Ritz or Raffles",131
Fullerton,3,“Do not book a courtyard room”,"Great looking hotel with lovely ambience. Breakfast is amazing—any choice you want- English, Japanese, Indian, Chinese. Great to sit outside and eat whilst watching those energetic joggers! The roof top bar took some finding—a very secret lift to it- but once there it was worth it! Views to the Marina Bay Sands and great views of the laser show.Reason I would not return - the room. It was billed as a courtyard room, and looked into the atrium of the hotel. I was instructed when shown to the room not to open the blinds as it would affect the privacy of the people on the other side of the courtyard!! I did complain, and they did offer to switch my room, but the offer came too late to be of use.",643
Fullerton,1,“A Disaster on Steroids!”,"I smelled a rat when My Dearest and I checked in at the Fullerton Hotel. The receptionist handed us our keys and chirped that she would escort us to the elevator. To the elevator? Are you joking? At most fine hotels a porter escorts you to your room when you arrive. In a few of the best hotels the receptionist guides you personally to your room. The goal is to (1) make sure you don’t get lost, (2) check that the room has been properly prepared for you, and (3) explain how the climate control and other things in the room work. Walking us to the elevator was a waste of time. A pretence of personal service that, in reality, was no service at all. Thanks, lady, but I can find my own way to the elevators.Our room was worthless. Tired old scraps of furniture with scratches, scuff marks, hanging cords, and threadbare fabrics. Many of the furnishings were made of fake yellow wood veneers glued onto particleboard. Some furniture had been damaged and then shoddily repaired with splashes of non-matching paint, masking tape, and in one case a wedge of folded up paper. The closet was small and lined with scraps of dusty plywood from many decades ago.The room was ugly with a yellow and brown color scheme from the 1960’s. Zero art on the walls. The carpet was frayed and in some corners torn. There were holes in the lamp shades. The few odd bits of wood trim did not line up with each other. The door to the room did not lock when it swung closed. I had to slam my body against the door to make it lock. This is a safety problem. There’s not much crime in Singapore, but still I don’t like sleeping in a hotel room with a semi-functional lock on the door.The bathroom was serviceable but depressing. The ugly tiles needed to be re-grouted. Bare floor with no rug. Shampoo and other bathroom product from Sysco Guest Supply. The thin white towels had been washed way too many times and reminded me of my college dormitory. The hair dryer was small and bolted to the wall. Cheap plastic toilet seat. Single ply toilet paper – of course!The Fullerton offers free WIFI. You get what you pay for – in spades. The WIFI functioned only intermittently. When it did function it was slow, often taking several minutes to open an e-mail. When I called to complain I was put on hold for ten minutes waiting for an IT support person who, when he finally answered the phone, knew less about computers than I do and was incapable of coherent speech.I try not to eat at buffets, because (1) food that sits on a buffet is usually dried out, overcooked, or waterlogged from the steamer, (2) buffets tempt me to overeat, and (3) I like to have a minion fetch my meal. One night, against my better judgment, My Dearest and I tried the dinner buffet at Town, the Hotel’s all-day restaurant. Absolutely awful! Roast meats that tasted of salt and stale grease. Vegetable curries filled with veggies that had disintegrated into a slurry. Chicken flavored rice with the taste of dehydrated chicken broth. In a desperate search for something remotely palatable, I gathered a plate of brown rolls and hard cheese. How could anyone screw up brown rolls and cheese? To my horror Town managed to do just that. The rolls tasted of old cardboard and the cheese of recycled plastic. We dined off property for the rest of our stay.The only redeeming quality of the Fullerton is its staff. For the most part, and with the notable exception of the IT support bozo, they are polite, enthusiastic, and professional. The concierge service was superb.This place is a disaster on steroids. Avoid it like the plague!",75
Fullerton,3,“Disappointed”,"The Fullerton is an impressive hotel in a great location and very willing, friendly staff but the rooms are average, business-hotel rooms with good bathrooms and zero character. We expected more.The additional club package was very good value although the cooked breakfast option was poor.I wouldn't choose to stay here again for leisure and it is too expensive for a business hotel, as there are (many) others in Singapore with similar pricing but better facilities.",151
Fullerton,3,“Business not Families”,"Have staid at the Fullerton previously for business, but came back during a Singapore stop over with the family on the back of a good two night deal that included breakfast, internet and late check out.This is a good hotel for business, but I would have reservations about taking the family back - its just not set up for that audience. Rooms are a bit small as is the pool area. Its in the CDB, so not that convenient for shopping (though Singapore is so expensive generally now that consideration is almost redundant).Another annoyance was the attempt to cancel the late check out on the basis that its \subject to availability\"" when I had a confirming email to the contrary. Sure they backed off, but the tone of the discussion was clearly a try on and at the price we were paying - even with the deal - really not on.""",53
Fullerton,1,“Old and Unkept”,"Stayed at The Fullerton Hotel as it was close to office, had some meetings in the function rooms as well. Meeting facilities look like a scary scene out of a 80s movie. Restrooms are old, spolit and dirty. Stayed at the Courtyard guestroom, you could tell from the state that rooms are old.",124
Fullerton,3,“Nice enough but not fantastic”,"A classic building, nicely renovated with a very impressive lobby area that occupies much of the ground floor. A nice location on the river, convenient location for most business and tourist purposes. The service is ok but can be a bit slow, front desk, porters, etc. In the Post Bar the staff were not very attentive and didn't know their menu or drinks well enough. The rooms are nicely furnished and quite well equipped; each one is a bit different in layout and size, and many have steps up or down once you are inside the room which would not suit everyone. I found it confusing to work out how to control the various lights and the bed side control panel had become disconnected.",327
Fullerton,3,“mixed feelings”,"arrived at the impressive looking hotel at 4pm after travelling 20hrs from UK.check in staff informed us that our room wasn't ready, could we come back in a couple of hours.i explained that we had booked 6 months ago and this was not acceptable.the lady went upstairs to check on the room, came back down to us, and repeated that the room would not be ready for a couple of hours.i asked to see the manager and explained my displeasure to him. he said he would do all that he could, but it would still be at least an hour before we could get our room. he offered us complimentary drinks and a meal, but we were too tired to accept. we sat outside and had one drink overlooking the river, then the manager came back and said the room was now ready.when we got to the room, we were very pleased to find that we had been upgraded from a courtyard room to a balcony room with a view overlooking the bay. very impressed with this room. we thought things were looking up.however when we went for breakfast the next morning, there was a 40 minute que for a table. after waiting 5 minutes, another staff member took us aside and took us to another breakfast area. waited again, before being asked if we would like a table making up in the internal courtyard area so we could eat straight away. We accepted.Breakfast on both days was dissapointing, the food seemed to be very bland without much taste.The hotel building itself is very impressive both inside and out. The location is perfect. Right on the bay, and a short walk to most areas.I feel the hotel is being poorly managed these days, living on past glory, and the staff could be better trained.i should be able to write a better review, after being given the room upgrade, but the experience at this property still felt underwhelming.",298
Fullerton,3,"“Dated rooms, mediocre service delivery”","Stayed on 20 Dec 13 in a courtyard room. Beneath its gorgeous and historic shell, the rooms are dated and the service delivery is expedient bordering impatient. First impressions: hotel was very crowded and noisy from a themed corporate dinner event. Ambience definitely not what you would expect from a luxury hotel. Check-in: staff was inflexible and impatient. Asked for late check-out, but was denied at first instance. Had to escalate to her supervisor. While I was speaking, she pushed a form and interrupted me midway to request I sign it, which I thought was rude. Essentially, I got the feeling that she wanted to process me ASAP and move on.Room: dated but clean and spacious. Bath was nicely done with separate bath and shower. Breakfast: good spread, but crowded. There was a line for breakfast, first time that I had experienced in a \luxury\"" hotel. Here's the kicker: at the traditional toast live station, i requested for a butter toast (i.e. No kaya - which is a local traditional jam). The staff immediately denied the request saying that it standard (i.e. The toast must be spread with kaya + butter). I fail to understand how challenging can it be for the staff to prepare a set without kaya. We sat al fresco, so a bird came swooping down on our breakfast when we were away. Staff Jenelyn conscientiously stood by our table to inform us when we got back, and facilitated our transfer to another table. Check-out: was a mess because of the crowd. But staff Harris handled it well. Others: bake shop staff Paul's service was sincere and friendly. Kudos. In summary, the property can have a nice exterior. But properly trained staff makes a real difference, especially when it's supposed to be a luxury hotel.""",75
Fullerton,2,“Horrible”,"We stayed at Fullerton Hotel for the first time on the 22 December. Check in was at 1 pm but did not get into the room until 4 pm, horrible with lots of guests waiting for rooms.Lots of sorry, sorry etc but the hotel did not offer to give guests anything like commentary tea / coffee!Breakfast was just as bad with a twenty minutes wait with gusts not happy waiting in queue a mile long.",218
Fullerton,3,“Nice location but utterly useless with children”,"I've stayed at the fullerton about 4 times with my first child. They are utterly useless with children. In the restaurant and they have no idea how to cater for children. You turn up with a child and have to ask (and importantly wait 5 minutes) for a baby chair, for a child's plastic plate, for a plastic spoon, for a plastic knife and so on. The concierge commented that 'my child protested a lot\ (he was 18mths). Our last visit was somewhat better (christmas time, child now nearly 3). At least they offered us children's cutlery. I still had to ask for a baby chair. On the way out, typical we had to wait for a taxi and so my 33 mth old decided to walk in and out of the door ( the turnstile one). One of the concierge (a male) told him off. When i asked what his problem was, he said he had to turn off the door (so what?! i thought seeing as we are waiting for a taxi and spent 400+ on lunch). He then told me \""to leave the hotel, he was pretty upset!\"". Perhaps we ruined his day? No problem! Rooms are pretty basic, but OK for business. I've decided that i really dislike it and won't be going back.""",268
Fullerton,2,“5 Star Hotel with 2 Star Service Experience”,"I've stayed at Fullerton Hotel several times and they were all positive, but this (21 Dec stay) was the worst! Of all the places I've travelled and hotels stayed, this is the FIRST time I have so many problems with check-in and check-out. Food and amenities were average.1. Horrible Check-in ServiceI checked-in at 4pm and had to wait half an hour for my room to be ready. Staffs were disorganized, poor communication - I wasn't informed that there was a change of room! The manager (Ryan) and his team simply explain with template responses (\high volume occupancy that caused delay, due to recent room promotions etc\""). Most guests pre-booked their rooms, so Fullerton should have known the high occupancy and should have taken steps (eg pre-arrange for additional manpower) to cater to the crowd. If they cannot handle, then don't do promotions!Ryan did service recovery by offering complimentary buffet dinner - food was so-so, I wouldn't pay to eat here.2. Fullerton cannot offer late check-outThey attributed it to the same excuses (\""high occupancy, due to recent room promotions etc\""). Even the manager (Ryan) cannot resolve this issue, which seriously makes people question the staffs capability and professionalism.Hence, when Fullerton run into issues, they put the blame on us customers - because we bought their promotions, we caused the hiccups and delays. This is simply ridiculous and it shows the sheer incompetency of the whole management team. The above are simple services and requirements a hotel ought to be competent in. Sadly, Fullerton Hotel is a disgrace SIngapore, as well as a shame to all other 5 star hotels.""",281
Fullerton,3,“Fantastic architecture but disappointing service”,"For the first time in my 20+ trips to Singapore, I stayed at The Fullerton, as my friends were getting married there. I had always had very romantic notions of The Fullerton, with its wonderful exterior and its great reputation.The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are spacious and designed to be luxurious. However, I found the rooms slightly old and run down, particularly the bathrooms. The toiletries provided were of poor quality for a 5-start hotel.I was not particularly impressed by the staff generally and the quality of inroom dining.I asked for late checkout on my last day and was informed that this would only be possible if I paid the full rate for 1 additional day (fair enough) and moved to a courtyard room. I felt rather annoyed and a bit cheated as:(i) The staff had to call me back 4 times to arrange for this(ii) They charged me a very high rate for a much worse room than the one I was originally in(iii) Having told me that I'd have to move rooms at 12:30 sharp, no one even told me which room I'd be moving to and I had to go through the circus of multiple calls to obtain the key to the new room and get someone to help me move my luggage The Fullerton is a truly beautiful hotel and their afternoon tea looked lovely. The hairdresser at the Salon de Florere was one of the best I've been to. However, I feel that the Fullerton is either poorly managed or takes its reputation for granted and feels like it doesn't need to make the effort - unlikely I will ever stay there again...",39
Fullerton,3,“World's most expensive coffee??”,"The hotel has a good location for business travellers, and the rooms are comfortable. Do not order a coffee here as whether at the lounge or at the cafe for breakfast it's over S$14 for a cup!! That's crazy.",235
Fullerton,2,“Very disappointing”,"I am visiting Singapore on business and this hotel is not my usual choice but because of close location to our client, we decided to stay. Upon arriving close to one in the morning from the airport, there were no doorman to help bring my luggages. I has to leave them outside to get help. My first room was very spacious but facing the lobby below and at 7 am, it felt like 7 pm. I requested a different room as I was going to stay for a week. They were very accommodating and give me a room facing outside of the building. Again very spacious but I have to step down vis short stairs to the bed room. Very unusual arrangement. But that was not the worst part of it. My next room neighbor was having all night party two nights in row screaming loudly and sounded like they were gambling in the room. Finally today, at 3 am I just could not stand it any longer. I called the front desk but it took them forever to come and ask my neighbor and their guests to end this so I had to do it myself. I travel very frequently in Asia and this never happened.Also the bathroom is huge but Plumbing is very shoddy and I had water leak after I took my shower. Unfortunately I will never come back here to stay.",390
Fullerton,3,“Sadly dissappointed”,"I had been wanting to stay at the Fullerton Hotel for some time and after an excellent stay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel in 2011 I was looking forward to the opportunity.Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations, whilst the stay was largely satisfactory, it is not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel with the accompanying price tag.It started at check-in with the offer from the very pleasant service staff to check if a late check out could be arranged as I had a late flight departure. She advised me she would check and message me once she had an answer one way or the other - alas this never occurred.My room was located on the 4th floor just around the corner from the elevator (Quay Room) - I arrived to find numerous chairs and a fold up table in the hall way around my room - I thought nothing of it until later in the stay when it became obvious why this continually occurred. The door directly opposite mine had a wheelchair sign on it which I initially thought nothing of - however on seeing staff exit the door the next afternoon it is not a wheelchair access point but rather the kitchen and an apparent staging area for the large conference/function room located on the 4th floor (which is booked out almost 100% of the time).This resulted in foot traffic and furniture removal noise until approximately 2300hrs both nights I stayed - not overly disturbing for me, but a potential source of annoyance to some people I am sure, along with the ever present stacks of chairs, tables and other items in the guest hallway.The room itself is unfortunately showing signs of being in need of refurbishment - many of the fixtures are showing obvious signs of damage and age and the bathroom has a somewhat liberal dosing of sealant in the shower to overcome mould and tile issues.The bed was excellent and very comfortable and the turn down staff were fantastic.The staff at the hotel are efficient and polite but seem to lack a genuine warmth - though I can understand why when you observe the way they are treated by some of the guests.All in all not a bad stay but not what I was expecting from such a well regarded hotel.",233
Fullerton,2,“Club rooms very tired and worn now”,"Date of stay 15 + 16 Oct 2013, Room 529. I am somewhat sad to be writing this review as I have often stayed at Fullerton and found it to be very good for business travel. The public areas are awesome, the gym is good and it is walking distance to CBD. However the rooms are now very worn and tired and no longer appropriate for top end business travel. I stayed this time in a Club room No 529 - the room reeked (and I mean really reeked) of mould. The nice people from housekeeping brought in two dehumidifiers and sprayed lots of Glen 20 to get rid of the smell but it didnt work. I took photos with my iPad and will try to attach those - in the bathroom on the mirror there are huge mould blooms visibly growing behind the glass, and there is mould in the shower stall. In the room the Powerpoints are coming out of the wall, and the gyprock ceiling is warped in places and showing signs of water damage. I real pity. I was there for work so I couldnt be bothered trying to move rooms as was staying only two nights, but it was pretty bad actually. If I had had my wife and kids I would have moved. I will preference staying at Mandarin Oriental or the newer Fullerton Bay next time.",135
Fullerton,3,“Perfect but Outdated”,"I have stayed a few times in this hotel and I found each room has quite different structure, which I felt quite odd time to time. I bet my room was heavily used by corporate events such as conference, so the wall was damaged and edge of mirror was broken. Furniture's quite oddly and unprofessionally painted, maybe coverup, and toiletry was not up to the level. Food was pretty decent, but I wasn't impressed with the quality of food to be honest. The concierge service was very professional and friendly, and doorman always warmly welcomed. Free limousine service (only available to the guests) was excellent but annoyed but chauffeur was quite cold. Grand hotel but lacks of details and luxury to some degree. Not a hotel I'd like to pay that much to visit again.",109
Fullerton,3,“Beautiful building in a great location. Average rooms”,"The building and location - fantastic! However, i found the rooms to not match the standard of the exterior. We got upgraded and found we were in a huge room with a large courtyard. A huge room would be great if they fitted it with enough furniture and the courtyard didn't look like a concrete jungle. They happily downgraded us back to the basic room which was much better and had a water view. The beds are comfortable. We are going back for one more night in Singapore and won't be staying here. For the price I don't think it meets the standard. The pool and gym were great.",263
Fullerton,1,“How to ruin a great stay on checkout”,"Stayed here on a business trip in July. Would have posted an EXCELLENT review if not for the treatment I received upon checkout. I stayed 3 nights and was checking out early (645AMish) on a Saturday to catch a flight back home. I did this after breakfast. When I was presented with the folio, there was a charge for a meal that I did not have. I asked for it to be removed and the front desk agent said he had to check the receipt. The receipt was nowhere to be found. His solution was that they'll look for the receipt and verify that the signature wasn't mine and will credit me if in fact it wasn't me who signed for the meal. So I said we should resolve it while I was there. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible as the department that had the receipt needed time to locate it. So I asked for a duty manager. No improvement. I pretty much felt that there was no trust at all that I was telling the truth. The fact that there was no other charges on the room but for the minibar purchase the night before that I advised them of on checkout didn't matter. The fact that I was trying to catch a flight didn't matter. So I've resolved not to use the Fullerton if at all possible. On a subsequent trip, I advised my assistant to book me in anything but the Fullerton. So I stayed at the Fairmont. Let's just say that I felt more trusted and welcomed at the Fairmont.",134
Fullerton,3,"“Pretty from outside, but feels like a prison from the room”","Stayed here for a night on a business trip. Its very close to the business district and is a very beautiful hotel. Location is also very good. Only issue was the view from the room. The base category rooms are huge in size with a brilliant bathroom. However, the view of these rooms of the lobby within the hotel. Thus its not possible to keep your curtains drawn as people from the lobby can look up. Also not suitable for a stay more than a couple of nights, as the inside view of the hotel can make you feel suffocated. If you stay here, pay a little more and get the city facing rooms. They also had a beautiful swimming pool. Did not try the food, but heard that its really good but expensive.",34
Fullerton,3,“Old hotel”,I accidentally booked the wrong hotel ( supposedly booked the Fullerton bay) and stayed here for 3 nights. Service was very good....staffs are very attentive...however I think the hotel really needs a good renovation.,188
Fullerton,2,“What a disappointment”,"When you pay a lot of money you expect high quality and high quality service. I was given a room with a large window and balcony, unfortunately there was a large brick wall on the balcony, hence no view, no point in having the window really, when I commented at reception the response was at best negative – ‘ we will give you a better room next time’, there won’t be a next time.It is supposed to be a 5 star hotel; well I’ve never had mould in the shower in a five star hotel before!My request for my morning newspaper failed as they delivered the wrong paper, the following morning it got sorted, they never bothered to deliver one at all.It is unlikely I will stay there again; there are much better options available.We were having a business meeting there, on returning to our meeting room after lunch they could not find the key to give us access, more time wasted.On check in as well as taking the full amount for the room charge they also add an additional SGD 200/ night for incidentals – very trusting!!!",386
Fullerton,3,“Great service but some things need tweaking”,"This is the third time I have stayed in the Fullerton, twice for business (6 weeks in total) and once on holiday. Don't get me wrong this is a nice hotel, in a great location (walking distance from Boat and Clark Quay) however having seen it over the years it seems a bit tired when compared to the Newer Fullerton Bay hotel, however it's an old historic building so probably to be expected.I had a courtyard facing room on the 6th floor. Positives and negatives as below:Positives - Swimming pool is really nice, although can be tricky to get a lounger on weekends. You can use the Fullerton Bay pool too which is nice and there is a free shuttle between the hotels (or you can walk under the underpass only 10 mins) - Courtyard facing rooms are bigger than those facing the bay and a lot quieter/darker so good for business travellers - Bathrooms in rooms are huge - Really good choice for breakfast (Indian, Japanese, Chinese, Western, Eggs, pastries, cereals), you never get bored, and a nice egg station with made to order - Service is good from concierge, reception and rooms cleaned well - Lobby is nice with fresh flowers everywhere and afternoon tea is meant to be good there - Gym has a good selection of kit, and modern technogym equipment with tvs. The weights are ok too (no barbells though) and has a bosu ball which is good!Negatives - Weird damp smell in hotel floors, was never sure what this was - Service at breakfast is a bit chaotic, being offered juice every 5 seconds, tables not being cleaned very promptly, drink orders sometimes forgotten - Some of the older rooms don't have many convenient plug sockets so had to scramble around trying to find somewhere to charge my phone (plugs are British ones) - Gym is ok, but so crazily hot! I asked time and time again for the air con to be adjusted and apparently they couldn't. I don't see why the gym has to be hot when the rest of the hotel is not. - Beds are rock hard, but do have a pillow menu optionI would stay here again if with work as the location is good, but would probably look elsewhere if coming for a holiday",168
Fullerton,3,“Facilities Closed”,"This is an average 5 star in a delightful old building. I think it gets so well reviewed because it is populated by persons who don't stay in hotels regularly that are celebrating birthdays, anniversaries etc. If you are used to 5 star hotels in Asia you will find the rooms average at best and a little dated.I stayed on Saturday 31st August and chose the hotel because I had invited a group of friends to meet me in the hotel's only bar - the Post Bar. Nothing was said at check-in but when I went down to make sure we could get adequate seating in the bar I found it to be closed for a private function, causing me considerable inconvenience. Hotels have function rooms and these should be the venues for private functions - not the hotels only bar. I do think hotels that sacrifice their guests in favour of extra money from non-guests do not deserve a return visit. Overall - a very disappointing stay.",126
Fullerton,1,"“The highest in price, the lowest in service”",This is the worst hotel I have ever experienced. The room they put me in had broken A/C. The room was exceedingly damp. All of my clothes were musty and moldy by the time I left. The hotel was fully booked for a conference and I could not switch rooms for 2 days. I was not offered compensation until I complained to the hotel. I was only compensated for one of the two awful nights. The service here is exceedingly poor. It took me 5 attempts and over an hour to get toast. The staff is incompetent. The gym is insufficient. The only positive is the location. The food is below average and the price for the food is expensive. I went for business. Never again.,108
Fullerton,3,“Satisfactory hotel but I expected more and better”,"The Fullerton is a very nice historical building. The service was satisfactory and the breakfast good however I was disappointed by the room: clean but old fashioned, cheaply refurbished (the yellow walls are awful) and dark (my window was accessing only on the lobby).But the worst was the Lighthouse restaurant (italian), considered as one of the \best restaurant in Singapore\"". Despite the nice view, the food was terrible and very expensive: the salad was made of not mature and not fresh ingredients, the carpaccio was fat, not thin enough and not fresh... However the bread and the pastas were decent.I think I was not lucky during this stay.""",68
Fullerton,3,“A challenging stay”,"After staying in any hotels in Singapore, I was excited to stay at Fullerton. However, the noise from the hallway outside the room was surprising. Pillows in the room were a little flat, shower was good though. Breakfast was frankly disappointing - the staff need to visit the Fairmont and Conrad (Hilton) to see how breakfast is done well. In terms of taxi, you are on your own.",100
Fullerton,3,"“Nice lobby, worn-out rooms”","The history of the hotel is quite interesting, and the lobby showcases some of that legacy. It's open, attractive, and welcomes guests in fine fashion. However, the rooms suffer somewhat...furnishings and carpet are worn and stained, and the room floorpans can be somewhat choppy as they forced into an old building. The location enables interesting views over to the Marina Bay Sands, and gives on to the harbor and \old singapore.\"" I ate at the restaurants for a breakfast and dinner...both of which were fine but not remarkable. I won't rush back here...its not really a standout among Singapore hotels.""",375
Fullerton,2,“Top location but very disappointed with Club Lounge service.”,"The wife & I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights prior to going on a cruise. We paid extra for the Club Lounge service & was very disappointed with what was provided.The Club Lounge advertized free \unlimited\"" drinks for the two hours between 6:00 & 8:00pm. Drinks along with finger food. We arrived, on the first night, at 6:00pm in this lounge room & was given a small glass of champagne.I was not served further & could not attract one of the two staff members eye - they were rarely in the room. I left my seat at 7:20 & approached a male staff member & asked for another drink. He did not come back to me & at 7:35 pm (15 minutes later) I sought & spoke to a female staff member. I followed her until she got me a drink - a red wine of 1/3 of a glass!The following night I again could only get two drinks - a small champagne & a 1/3 of a glass of red wine. I was not trying to free load......we had paid for a service which was not provided. Each night I obtained two small drinks in a period of 2 x 2 hours of so-called \""unlimited\"" free drinks. Nothing but a blatant con job.I complained at the front desk & was told that as it was a weekend they were very busy. If that was the case they should have put on additional staff or told us they could not provide their advertized service & we would not have paid for it.It may be a 5 star hotel but we had a one star bed in our room. It was so hard it made my back ache from sleeping on it. My wife likes a firm bed but she found that the bed made her back ache as well. Not comfortable at all. Our room was opposite the lifts & a function centre - in which a wedding reception was held on the Saturday night. We were disturbed, until late, with music & the coming & going of guests.I definitely would not stay at this hotel again. It does not compare favourably with other Singapore hotels in which we have stayed.""",89
Fullerton,2,“Disappointing stay at this hotel”,"I read so many rave reviews of the Fullerton and decided to give it a try during my stay here in Singapore for three days. It was a HUGE disappointment. The rooms are so old and outdated and in dire need of a renovation. The place is seriously overhyped and the view from my room wasn't as great as advertised on their website. In fact, the view of the river was blocked by a random huge pillar. What a disappointing stay! The staff should also improve their service attitude.",245
Fullerton,2,“What a rip-off!!”,"I was on a business trip in Singapore and have been booked into the Fullerton. This hotel looks very impressive and is nicely located in Singapore. However, the service personnel is nice but incredible helpless. I first got a room which was not cleaned from the guest before even though I had to wait longer during the check-in because someone was sent up to check the room. Obviously not successfully. Instead of cleaning the room I was rebooked. So I changed the nice looking room I had before against an older one even though bigger one. Due to the architecture I now had a room with a tiny window to the inner court which means - no daylight at all - it was incredible dark. The furniture was rather old. The internet was very unstable making it difficult to work. The water in the shower did not get over lukewarm which made the use of the rainshower a bit a pain. Lukewarm seems to be a bit the hotel motto since the coffee in the morning had the same temperature. The breakfast buffet was surprisingly small for such a posh hotel. The cheese plate we had in the evening consisted of 3 mini-pieces quite ordinary cheese and old grapes. Overall the hotel did not convince me - I would expect this in a 3star below hotel. And the biggest shock came when I checked out - I paid 350€!!! for this night. Never ever again!",282
Fullerton,3,"“For us, just not worth the $”","We booked this for a spot of old-world charm and a bit of luxury. While the facade oozes both, the reality of our stay was different.We were somewhat greeted by our doorman and after check in (BTW the reception girl was just delightful) shown to our room. It was a lovely room on the face of it and the view was just beautiful out over the bay. Unfortunately our bed was just so gone that just a slight push resulted in loud squeaks. We also had issues with the electric panel and, after advising reception, within half an hour we were moved to another room, which was great. The new room, which again was lovely on the face of it, with the same great views, featured a power point that was hanging off the wall and a bathroom that smelt of mould. We really didnt want to complain again so we just stuck with the room we were given, despite not being totally happy. The breakfast was perfectly fine, but we were pretty disappointed when we had to argue with one of the waiters that the table we had just left to get our breakfast was indeed ours as they attempted to seat someone else there. This, coupled with a half hour wait for a coffee was a bit annoying.The prices overall in the hotel were pretty high (we paid S$40 for 2 beers in the bar) but what bothered us most is that we felt that, because we weren't business travellers, we didnt really matter. That was just our perception. We will definitely return to Singapore and while the location of The Fullerton was brilliant, we probably won't stay here again.",83
Fullerton,3,“Great foyer.”,The Fullerton is a wonderful old building well positioned on the Quay. It has a magnificent foyer.We were upgraded from a superior room but unfortunately our room was very tired but had a great view of the Quay and Marina Bay Sands.The bathroom however was large and luxurious. Breakfast is terrific....they really spoil one for choice. The staff are excellent.It was a trifle offputting to have a man walking along our balcony sweeping up very slowly as we were not dressed for company.,151
Fullerton,1,"“Really bad rooms, questionable cleanliness, horrible hotel”","What a disappointment!!! We wanted to try to Fullerton Hotel as it seemed ok from the outside but we discovered that it is just ugly and cold, dirty and with bad wifi on the inside. The lobby looks like a train station with 5 sources of music coming from everywhere and the rooms like a pensioners house. We changed three times rooms as the first and second rooms did not have a window, or a very small one and we have been told that a room with a window is a different category. Outrageous. Especially for the price paid, that of course excluded breakfast, that is outrageously expensive. Additionally, pillows smell like sweat, furniture is from the 80s, cleanliness is questionable at best. Even with the best goodwill of the front desk that tried to find a solution, we left early and checked in another hotel as soon as we could.",191
Fullerton,3,“Go just for the historical factor”,"The hotel used to be the general post office from colonial days in Singapore, and is quite a sight architeculturally. Also sports one of the nicer hotel bars in town too.Wasn't impressed with the room though.Stayed 1 night in a Courtyard room, which faces into the main atrium.Decor felt dated.Main letdowns were (1) the bed , 2 singles mattresses placed together do not make a double / queen. the separation/gap is discernible under the covers (photo uploaded) (2) the TV was woefully small, I couldn't watch the match from the bed, (3) the curtains did not block out the light from the atrium into which the room was facing, whole room faintly lit when all lights turned off and (4) the doors are not sound proof enough, I was woken up by an overeager tour group trooping down the corridor boisterously discussing breakfast.On a positive note, the pool was pretty neat together with all the loungers.In room tea selection was very good, assortment of TWG teabags provided.I would still recommend it (but not more than one night) if you're visiting Singapore, for the heritage and the location near the bay area.",36
Fullerton,3,“Past its best”,Beautiful facade but service was a bit lack lustre in all areas. I would expect more at these price levels.Breakfast was the food highlight but was expensive.This was my second visit but would not return again.,162
Fullerton,3,“Loverly Hotel but could have been better”,"Room was not ready at check-in, I had just come off a long plane trip and wanted to rest. When I got into my room at approx 2.30 had to wait (and call concierge) for my bag to be brought to the room so I could shower and get some rest. I had booked a twin room with quay views so I could view the laser show at the Marina Bay Sands.The beds were not two king single beds as comparable hotels do - but small single beds, I stayed in room 611 and this has the large Singaporean flag directly in front of the window/balcony which meant I could not see the light show - apart from when there was a drop in the wind. It was obvious there had previously been a leaking shower and the timber around the bathroom/toilet had rot. Staff were friendly and helpful but overall a disappointing stay - especially considering the price and other recommendations",269
Fullerton,3,“Mixed Views”,"The Fullerton Hotel Singapore is in a beautiful Heritage Building,the Old Colonial Post Office.With its Gigantic Columns it looks majestic especially when lit up at night.The location is very good.,just next to the Merlion and the CBD ,Opposite the imposing Mueseum of Asian Civilizations and walking distance from Boat/Clarke Quay and the River Promenade.But being an old buidling,the rooms do suffer in terms of size and comfort We stayed Dec 2012 in the Quay room,which was a pretty tight squeeze.,at the same price you can get a much larger room at the Four seaons or Mandarin Oriental The room had a balcony though ,which was nice and a good view of the city.I do wish there was some seating in the balcony.The Bathroom is decent sized,.with a window, tub and shower stall..no TV here though.Also there is only 1 vanity.There is no foyer in the room and no dressing area for ladies The bedlinen could be finer/whiter and the towels could be more luxurious.All in all..there is the advantage of a good location and feeling of staying in a Heritage property..but in terms of sheer luxury of room. and linen..hotels like St Regis and Four seasons score much higherThe Post Bar is good..excellenet Martinis The Italian restaurant Lighthouse on the rooftop is great..though twice the price of a similar restaurant in New York or even Hongkong. The breakfast is rather dreary..food is average and srevice is poor.The spa is pretty good,so is the gym but they close at 11 pm The pool is much advertised,and has great views of the singapore river area..but is rather carmpedThe service is good.",251
Fullerton,2,“My husband was bitten by bed bugs on our first night & rooms are not cleaned properly for a five star hotel”,"On our first night, my husband was bitten whilst asleep in bed and ended up with several bites on his body. He had to sleep on the couch to avoid being bitten further. We were transferred to another room the next day. Despite the duty manager and the hotel doctor confirming they were fresh bites, the hotel kept insisting that they could not find any bed bugs. The rooms are definitely not properly cleaned and has a musty smell. On our first day, the cups we have used were not replaced with clean ones, nor did they clean our bathroom. The carpet of our second room was not vacumned and feels dirty; the tissue remnants and a champagne cork we found on the floor (left by previous occupants) were still on the floor 3 days later and this despite us having informed the duty manager the same evening. We had problems communicating with the housekeeping staff. They told us they did not understand or speak English. We have stayed at many hotels in different countries, but not one with such poor standards of cleanliness, especially in a five star hotel in Singapore and certainly not been bitten by bed bugs before. We are disappointed by the poor standards of cleanliness and feel that this aspect needs inspecting and improvements made. Their attitude is disappointing. I feel so strongly about this I have decided to put my comments here.I would like to say that the concierge and restaurant staff were very helpful.",178
Fullerton,2,“Disappointed”,"This is our second time to visit this hotel since 4 years ago. The purpose for both visits were for new year countdown. We are disappointed we found no improvement at all as compared with our last visit. I agree the exterior of the hotel is a historical building which needs to keep its nature. However, the interior decoration is rather dated not deserved to be a 5 star hotel. The reception/check in service is not attentive and indifferent to our enquiry. The concierge service is slow and non-efficient that most of the time with only 1 staff at the front door and sometimes even none. We have to pick up our luggage to the taxi without any assistance. Luckily at one time we noticed someone was there, but was keep chatting with taxi drivers, local people or selected customers they preferred. The room is tidy but insufficient amenities that a 5-star hotel shall normally have. The only service I appreciate is the buffet breakfast. We will not consider this hotel again for our next trip in Singapore.",303
Fullerton,2,“Very disappointing room and service”,"We were looking forward to stay at this historical place but were very disappointed by the service. We checked in a room on 5th floor, a large bedroom with a very nice bathroom with private WC. Unfortunately on the second night , we had to listen to a loud music played by a live band in the Post Bar on the ground floor. The music was so loud and not really pleasant to hear 5 floors above, so we decided to watch TV to cover the noise which we had to put also quite loud to listen . After one hour, we decided that was a bit too much and contacted the reception. A very polite receptionist proposed to look into this matter but nothing happened. By 10:20, we really had enough and again asked the reception to reduce the volume of the music. The person offered to check and proposed to us another room on 7th floor. After one and half hour of loud music we accepted the offer. What a disappointment! We felt we were \punished \"" for complaining. The room and the bathroom were much smaller, the furniture and the carpet were badly stained and the curtains showed many mold stains, which gave a very unpleasant smell of dampness to the room. Meanwhile, a few minutes after we've moved, I phoned the reception to explain my disappointment , not only did I receive a confirmation that this room was an upgrade, but the receptionist had the pleasure to let me know that the music had just stopped! It seems that none of the receptionists I contacted made an enquiry with the band and we received a simple apology for all this trouble and an unpleasant room. This hotel has a very grand facade but the experience was not so grand!""",189
Fullerton,3,“Surprised to find this was just OK ....”,"Stayed for a one night staycation in early December and found the accommodation to be distinctly average. This in itself was a surprise. I have eaten at The Town Restaurant endless times, and attended brunches and the bar at The Fullerton many times and always found The Fullerton to offer exceptional service and an impressive experience. Sadly, staying at the hotel just didnt measure up to my expectations. I stayed in Room 589. The decor is looking tired and the room just didn't have the feel of a 5 star hotel. When we needed to go out later in the evening being a guest didn't garner any favor with the concierge when it came to getting a cab and we had to wait with everyone else. Was also told the swimming pool was closed, but if I wanted to swim I could be transported to the parent hotel over the road ....I understand the hotel is very busy and there are patrons visiting the restaurants, bars, shops or just to visit the amazing building but I was expecting a little more as a guest and this was not forthcoming.",73
Fullerton,3,“Good Business Location”,"The Fullerton is an impressive looking old world building from the outside. I had a standard room for 3 nights which was not as impressive. The room seemed a little small, however, the bathroom area was fine. The hotel was busy with functions, however good service was maintained. Disappointingly, the swimming pool was under renovation which I was not advised of at the time of booking. If known, I would have stayed elsewhere.",116
Fullerton,3,“Expected More”,"Perhaps I falsely had high expectations but I was expecting more of this hotel. I'm sure we weren't staying in any kind of their prime rooms but with the atmosphere this hotel gives off I would expect all rooms to still have a 'wow' factor.Awkwardly arranged furniture (re: room spacing). Comfortable beds. Bathroom was nice, clean, and spacious (a highlight of the room). Unfortunately we did have to wait a while before our room was actually ready. Concierge was helpful.Good location. Main highlight was the chocolate buffet available on the main floor. It is a tasty experience worth making time for (as we did on our last night). Overall - Nothing bad, yet nothing great. Recommended.",119
Fullerton,1,“Renovations leading to significant noise in some rooms”,"I've stayed at the Fullerton a number of times and come back because of its location and the generally good experiences I've had.I stayed on the 6th floor last week however and have to report that there is a significant amount of noise coming from renovation works of the upper floors.I can accept that this needs to be done and is welcome, but during the day, not the evening/night. On my second night I couldn't get to sleep because of the noise and was then woken up at 10.30pm by what sounded like someone dropping large metal objects onto the hard floor above my room.Be careful which room you have......this is not acceptable hotelier behavior at $500 a night....",105
Fullerton,2,“Terrible treatment”,"Checking at the Fullerton took more than 30 minutes though we were the only people checking in. Although we had been upgraded in advance of our arrival at the hotel, the (western) staff at the front desk spend more than 30 minutes attempting to find a room at a lower category. I can't be certain, but I expect this was due to her own personal bigotry. There was no apology for the delay or for the conspiratorial whispers. Despite this shocking treatment at check-in, we were satisfied with the hotel overall, as most of the staff were very professional, and the pool area was lovely.",346
Fullerton,3,“OK - but not great.”,"I have stayed in this hotel several times because I like the location - but the location and character of the building are the key selling points - it can be disappointing inside.My most recent stay was in a heritage room - this is something of a lottery, as might be expected from an old, converted building. You really never know what you are going to get. The rooms are advertised as 38 - 71 sq metres, for example. The room in my most recent stay had a flight of stairs just inside the room leading down to a small, thin room with the bed at one end and the TV at the other - too far away to be of use from the bed. The \window\"" in the room was behind the bed and overlooking the bay, but it a tiny window of about 2 square feet at chest height the rest was a concrete beam. So very little natural light in the room.There were also renovations going on in the hotel - so there was loud drilling and hammering noises all afternoon on 16th and 17th November. There was no mention of this at the time of reservation, upon check-in or via a letter in the room apologising for the disturbance - at times almost deafening.It was something of a noisy weekend. The hotel has only one bar - the Post Bar, in which we were stranded on the Friday evening due to heavy rain outside. There was a function in the bar that evening with a young DJ playing an appalling selection of house, techno music at unbelievable volumes. It was not possible to speak to even the person next to you. Only pleadings some several customers - all of whom looked like jazz/ bossa nova type customers in their 40s and 50s - had the music reduced to bearable levels. Many others simply left and suffered the rain in search of quieter drinks.Worthwhile if you like old buildings with character - but with all the flaws that tend to accompany such hotels.""",242
Fullerton,3,"“Not a bad place for business, not the best”","I stayed at the Fullerton on a business trip in November. From the outside it is a beautiful building, and it is quite nicely located in the central business district. It purports to be a '6 star' hotel though and here I must disagree, except in its pricing of food (£26 for breakfast?)! It's a 5 star hotel, because various slip-ups while I was there disappointed me. First of all, the cleaning staff were not very attentive about replacing tea & coffee faclities, leaving me with no milk by day 2. Then, despite the cost of the breakfast buffet, I found the staff overly keen to seat you in the dark seats by the entrance and not by the windows, and the buffet itself while extensive is fairly randomly laid out across the breadth and length of the big (&multi-level) eating area. The rooms are pretty small & the layout doesn't make sense - the TV is so far from the bed it's not actually very easy to watch. Finally, i found reception and concierge staff to be rather slow and some struggled with English. I also watched them be quite unhelpful to a Japanese guest who was trying to work the lift. They remained behind the desk, despite the fact that he was struggling and couldn't understand what they said. All in all, it's hardly a hardship to stay here, but not quite worth the reputation it purports itself to have",45
Fullerton,3,“This hotel is like an elderly lady with its own charm”,"If you fancy a trendier hotel, then stay at the hotel’s younger sister; The Fullerton Bay Hotel. However, The Fullerton Hotel Singapore has with its historic building its own charm. The two-storey duplex suite offers great views and a beautiful terrace to enjoy the outdoors.",65
Fullerton,3,“If u like the architecture..history...”,"Yes…the view is spectacular.. if your room is facing the sea, you will have a panoramic view spanning the skyscraper-banks in Shenton Way to the iconic Singapore Esplanade Theatre. And with the recent addition to the skyline - the Marina Sands..right in front!And yes.. i love the architecture of the Fullerton..with it's old world charm.That's about all the good I can say about the Fullerton.",345
Fullerton,3,"“Lacks attention to detail, lots of room for improvement.”","We were on the 5th floor, and initially I was please seeing there was a patio.....that is until we opened the curtains and patio was more like a little cell. No view. Of ANYTHING. All that can be seen is white bricks, honestly it's claustrophobic. The room itself, while sizable, is tired and needs some refreshment. The service is neither fawning nor seriously lacking- it's just average. The pool was gorgeous- huge and located so that you can see the footbridge, quite lovely, really. The water feature with the 88 koi is lovely as well. One thing that drove me bonkers is the internet connectivity. Maddeningly, one had to re-connect every time one entered or left the hotel (definitely) or if you had been on for a period of time. And, I'm talking start over as in enter your room number and password etc....A big waste of my time. The mini bar was a thumbs down. No wine. Limited selection of items, overall. The Spa? Ugh. I think that it MAY (?) have been in the middle of a renovation, but if it was, there was no indication of that in terms of signage. There was not a single plug in the sink area. (I wasn't able to plug in my flat iron.) There were no lockers. There was no seating. The wet sauna needed to be regrouted as there was some blackening on it. There were only three pair of shower thongs available. Additionally, I had wanted to get a manicure, but the spa menu provided in the room does not list this as a service. Only later on did I find out that they offer it, and that was after specifically asking. The bed is VERY firm. This is fine for me because I love a firm mattress, but I was surprised that it was so hard. All in all, I wasn't so impressed with the Fullerton- we had expected much more after the trip advisor reviews. Again, it wasn't terrible at all, but I did find it to be very very average.",539
Fullerton,1,“Very disappointing experience”,"Lost count of stays in this hotel. Generally very short stay however this trip book for 4 nights as scheduled meetings within 1 mrt stop vicinity.Reservation suggested to upgrade to club level for this trip. I checked in just after noon time and had a glass of coffee in the room. Went out very shortly after. Cup was still there went I return in the evening. The next day I left early and return around 3pm. Cup was still there, unwashed! Went to club and complaint and was told this is the first time they received such complaint. Ok fine, then 2nd day return at 130pm for conference call, room was unmade. The next day, left early again and return at 2pm, surprise, surprise, unmade. Call housekeeping and was told maybe I left the do not disturb sign now. I never ever put on the do not not disturb sign because this is not the first time I heard the excuse and I made it a point never to put on the sign for no room for excuse. To make it worst, there was a seminar on the 3 rd day and discovered to my horror that the room across mine was used as a store which explain the non stop noise of cutlery , footsteps, talking, mobile ringing ,etc then I notice the stench!!! Whatever the room is called by the hotel, it is across. I found stacks of dirty plates left just 2 steps from my room door, stacks of dirty linens, trolleys, etc I leave it to your imagination. Final last straw, made a big fuss at reception and changed the room to the end of the building. On the 4th day found the club close for a private event and again food smell in the whole corridor like in a local market. This means having to use only the elevator at the reception otherwise would have to walk into the private event and that elevator leads to the pool and gym.....Then another event in the evening. That breakfast, since the club is closed means having to dine in The Town with the big weekend family crowd. So much for paying extra for privacy. As much as the GM tried to explain, I empathize with the staff but it is very sad to see this sort of service like putting on the do not disturb sign, first time it happens,etc. The hotel really spoilt my trip as it is my first return home nearly in a year and looked so much forward to it.I stayed in the hotel when it first opened, worked in it when it was under construction, now to experience this shatters my nostalgic feeling for one of my favorite place in Singapore.Furniture in the room is looking tired, there is no adapters in the room and the small bottles of shampoo, etc needs very strong finger to squeeze them.A few suggestions for the management: maybe the staff for cleaning is insufficient for maximum occupancy. If the club is close, maybe they should have offered room service at least for breakfast. But at least, tell the client especially if book via corporate if there is a function and suggest room change before checkin.",238
Fullerton,3,"“Average property, overrated compared to other options in Singapore”","I was staying in this hotel for over a week and every day there was something that needed attention of the hotel manager. The service in the hotel is not perfect and there is a lot of room for improvement.The rooms of the hotel are interestingly rated: I was booked into a standard (cheapest) room and it was very spacious with a patio (on the second floor). When I was checking in, I was offered an upgrade and went to check out the higher grade room on the 7th floor - very small and without a big balcony, so I refused this upgrade.The quality of sleep is excellent though, very firm (good for me) beds.Breakfast has a lot of variety, but the quality is really poor, very often I was better off with a cup of coffee and a toast either in the lobby bar or outside of the hotel.The hotel has a small gym area which is not crowded and often I was there the only one person exercising. The building and location of the hotel is great. There is also the fullerton by the Bay hotel which is from the same family of the properties and it is worth visiting, especially during the night: nice music, vibe and a pool.I would recommend staying in this hotel but it will be important to manage your expectations around the service in the hotel - do not expect much.",170
Fullerton,2,“A dissapointment..”,"I was always interested in staying in this hotel, as it is such a beautiful historical building. So we went there for a weekend in July. The arrival experience was poor, we could not find the reception because nobody brought us there! I expected the staff to be more welcoming, and more friendly. They all look too serious and mechanical. The biggest dissapointment was the room. It is small, it smells like mould, and the furniture is outdated. I felt like going back in time and not in a 5 star hotel at all.. There was even mould on the walls of the bathroom. I could take it off with a tissue easily! We could move to a bigger room, but unfortunately this didn't change our experience.The breakfast is very good with a lot of choice, but again the service staff not happy. It looked like it was a torture for them to work there.Ofcourse the location of the hotel is great and the building looks beautiful, but that's all.",570
Fullerton,3,“Not at its peak-performance; wish it was better!”,"The Fullerton Hotel has so much potential, but lacks the high service standards, attention to detail, technology incorporation into the room, and is beginning to show its age.We opted to stay at the Fullerton Hotel recently as we were celebrating our cousin's birthday at the Lighthouse. And what with the National Day celebrations around the corner, we thought it wise to get a room here or fight the crowd and traffic as we leave the Marina Bay area.Check in was quick and breezy. The front office team were efficient and professional, but lacking in warmth. The Heritage Room was huge. I was quite impressed by the large room. On one end, a long built-in table with cupboards stretches from the end of the walk in closet to the window. There is a fridge, in-room-safe and DVD player tucked into the cupboard. Above the long table, a large flat screen TV on the wall with the usual assortment of cable TV channels - HBO, CNN, Fox, ESPN and Star, plus the local TV stations. An oval writing desk is placed next to the window. The room is carpeted, but you can feel that its a little worn. The carpet around the bed and TV/study table area was more plush than around the area leading in from the door. Wifi is free for hotel guests.The bathroom was a good size with marble floor finishes, It has a bathtub, single sink, a separate rain shower, and a toilet tuck away in one corner. Toiletries are provided. The room had a view of the office building opposite and the Singapore river on the side. Window is single-ply, not sound proof. We could hear some machinery hard at work nearby, especially when seated on the couch near the window. The curtain left a gap at the sides, letting in the light in the morning.The swimming pool in the third floor faces the Singapore river and is bathed by the afternoon sun. It is a 25m long and the infinity edge welcomes you to just soak and watch the river life go by. The pool is very popular with the guests. It is unfortunate that some tiles have popped out of the pool and it seems to be in need of a cleaning as there were sand and some 'stuff'.Being the National Day long weekend, breakfast was a mad affair. Come down at 9am and expect to queue for a table. Breakfast ends at 10am [I think], so if you get down by 8am, you should be okay; especially if the hotel is running on full-occupancy. The breakfast spread was very generous. Japanese, local, western, cold cuts, yoghurt, fruits, freshly fried eggs can all be had. Food is of good quality and very generous. Some of the service staff here were very warm and professional, offering to get juices for you on top of your coffee/tea.Parked our car in the garage overnight. Parking is free for hotel guests. You will need to obtain a coupon from concierge for free parking.We were comfortable in the hotel. No qualms about security and the cleanliness of the room. We just felt that it lacked the warmth and 'extra-mile' of the hotel and its team. While it is a 5 star hotel, we have stayed in other hotels that have shown us what 5-star luxury is really like. It is also showing its age and probably due for a face-lift.",94
Fullerton,3,"“Lovely building, housing a decent, but corporate-feel hotel interior.”","A wonderful colonial building, once the General Post Office. Now a cavernous hotel which is fairly corporate but is perfectly acceptable for a short stay in Singapore. There are limited restaurant facilities, but as you're in the centre of the city you should be going out. Extensive buffet breakfast coaster caters for every taste - comprehensive, and fresh. Rooms are well kitted out, free wifi, comfortable beds and good bathrooms.Swimming pool is nice, compact and not many places to relax but, as you're in the centre of the city this is a welcome addition.",45
Fullerton,3,"“Ancient building, ancient room”",Spent a night with my family in a heritage room. Spacious (70 sqm) but quite old. The style an the atmosphere are missing. Overall it is a good solution if you look for a lower five stars at a reasonable prove. Reasonable in Singaporean words.,140
Fullerton,2,“lost its glory”,"the room is rather small, which is typical for Singapore. the moist is in the air from the moment you enter the room (carpet) and the furniture is in deer need of renovation. the amenity line up is comparable to a european 4 star hotel. the balcony comes without chairs and full chip off wall painting. the lobby is grand, yet dark, and on rainy days rather sinister. the gym was equipped with basic instruments, the threadmills (all) were falsly installed, forcing you to run on elevation. the pool comes with a great view but is limited to 10 sundecks (400 rooms). Breakfast is ok, with plenty of options and an efficient but coldhearted service and an armada of birds minggeling around the tables. the assistant guest recognition manager (from Tokio) is a well trained asset and made our stay.",182
Fullerton,3,“Fullerton Sunday Brunch”,"We stayed in Singapore for a few days on our honeymoon and as we love the Brunch's, we decided to make a booking. We had booked a table outside but as it was so warm, we asked if they could accomodate us inside, this was no problem. The food and champagne was lovely. Towards the end of the brunch time, I asked the waitress for a re-fill of champagne and waited a while, then i asked again and I saw her pouring the next table, thinking I was next. I wasn't and I waited again. After about half an hour, I asked one of the senior waiters and I was told that Brunch was finished. I explained that I had asked well before it was finished and so I saw him talking to our waiter who was obviously making her excuses. In the end, I got my glass of champagne but was kind of fed-up at this stage and didn't really enjoy it. Was too much trouble for a glass of vino. Food was delicious but like everything in Singapore, quite expensive.",316
Fullerton,3,“Not good enough”,"There is an awful lot to like about the Fullerton. The location is the best in Singapore. The building is beautiful both inside and out, with lovely public spaces. The pool is perfect, with exceptionally helpful and friendly pool staff.But there is too much wrong with the basics of good hotel service for me to return. We checked in at 330 (checkin time is 2) and were told no room was available, despite me having exchanged confirmatory emails about the room type I had booked just a few days before. After 15 minutes of arguing a room materialised. That might sound trivial but when i book a 5 star hotel i expect a smooth and enjoyable arrival. Sadly this wasn't the end of the service failings. Room service breakfast came without milk for the tea. Our room had not been serviced when we came back at about 130 having been out all morning. Tea and bicuits came as a grotty flask and 4 minute cookies from a packet. Poor signing meant that when we opened our terrace doors, we discovered a bolshy American sitting on one of the chairs. She should have known it was a private terrace of course but when I complained it seemed this was a common occurrence that could be fixed by a simple sign. In the end i gave up complaining because it ruins your mood. Every time i did complain, written apologies and wine,fruit, chocolates appeared in the room, but that's not the point. I expect ease and relaxation, not aggro and freebies.The rooms are ok but nothing amazing for a 5 star place, and the furnishings do feel a little tired. Sound proofing seemed poor, but that might have been bad luck with neighbours.It's a magnificent place, better located, prettier and more interesting than the Mandarin, but it could learn a lot from the way that MO do service.",52
Fullerton,3,“Great foyer but the rooms???”,This stunning old building is a delight to be in but the room choices are very average especially if you are not wanting to spend a fortune. But even for a suite the views are average. The deco is excellent and service impeccable but for value I have had better in Singapore,29
Fullerton,1,“Over price”,It's over price with the service provided. the housekeeping service was bad. It took 30 min to have extra pillow to be delievered after 2 calls to the housekeeping.,74
Fullerton,3,“The housekeeping trolley always park outside my room!”,"The hotel location is no doubt convenient for your access to business center or shopping center.Exteriors is also great with the historical heritage, room is clean, standard hotel equipped setting.The only thing annoying me is the housekeeping trolley always park outside my room, and the staff are trying to get into my room for a few times as long as my Do Not Disturb light going off!!! Lucky I got the door really locked!!!",123
Fullerton,3,“Where are the staff ?”,Just spent 2 nights at the Fullerton and found the hotel to be pretty average and not worthy of 5 stars. The room itself was nice with a great view and nice and relaxing decor etc.My problem with the hotel was its service. The service at breakfast was next to non existent ! The staff were nowhere to be found. We never even got offered a coffee refill and the table was never cleared of dirty plates etc. No where near 5 star. The staff outside calling taxi's were in one word hopeless ! They were disorganized and not doing what should be a simple job well at all. This hotel management needs to address these issues and fast. Simply not good enough.,207
Fullerton,3,“Not as good as the pictures suggest”,"I had high hopes for this hotel, based on the website, the pictures and word of mouth. The reality was that it was pretty average. The room decor seemed dated, partially because it was old, partially because the room smelled a bit musty and partially because it seemed to lack a personal touch. Little things, like a well used shower mat rolled up near the tub, fraying linens and marks on the furniture just made it all seem like the Fullerton had seen better days. Service was not welcoming. I went out to the pool and it was an hour before I eventually walked up to the attendant myself to order a drink, after trying to catch her attention 3 times. There was not enough\please\"" and \""thank you\"" either from the staff, which I would expect from a 5 star hotel. Finally, no one ever seemed to be there when you arrived...at the taxi stand, at the door, at the little bakery in the lobby....I always felt like I was waiting for a few minutes before one of the staff noticed I needed something, ie, no anticipation of needs. It wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, just very average. And for the price paid, disappointing.""",70
Fullerton,3,“Convenient business location but small room”,Stayed here a couple of nights in May 2012. I got a room with the balcony. Was surprised to find the room so small. There was no view at all. Furniture and fixtures are dated. The location is convenient because right in the business district. We went to the lounge for breakfast. The service was bad and selection limited. We had a business luncheon there and the food was good.,36
Fullerton,3,“Time for an upgrade”,"Hotel is still good, but starting to fall behind its competitors. Central location (and good breakfast) are still strong selling points, but rooms feel dated and service not up to high Singapore standards. Bar is dull.",107
Fullerton,2,“Damp rooms and issues at check in.”,I wanted to like this hotel! The ambience is wonderful and the location is great. Upon arrival i was told that they didn't receive the fax from my company regarding the payment on our credit card. They then locked up $1500 on my credit card before eventually found the paperwork two days later.Then i went to my room which was extremely damp and the air conditioner was so cold. All of my other reviews prove I am reasonably easy to please. Didn't get off to the best start and never really improved.Breakfast was a positive. Im returning to Singapore for business in July and will look elsewhere.,575
Fullerton,1,“Not worthy of 5 star!”,"I have booked a courtyard room on my birthday. First of all the room. The room was wonderful, about the right size with all the necessary amenities. Bed was big and comfortable. The bathtub was big and comes with a separate shower stall. The amenities are of high quality, ranging from the baths to the beverages. The have TWG tea bags in room. The room comes with free Wifi, which is important not only to business clients, as well as for leisure customers. The airconditioning in room is superb, which is very effective in cooling down people after a hot day in Singapore. However the goods stops here. The hotel has good hardwares, but terrible software! The service is sub standard, not worthy of 5 star!My friend had arranged for a birthday cake to surprise me during my birthday! When we were checking in, there was no mentioned of the cake! We waited till around 5pm, still no sign of the cake! My friend had to call the reception to check out on the cake that was promised to us. To our surprise, the reception had no clue about this prior arrangement! After some checking, the reception promised to deliver the cake at 5.30pm on their turn down timing. We waiting for another 45 mins, still no sign. Frustrated we left the hotel and head for our dinner! Upon our return, there is still no sign of the cake or traces of it being delivered! My friend called reception once again and asked about the cake. This time round, the reception claim ignorance. This is when I got pissed off, how can a 5 star hotel, despite promising their customer, go back on their word. We literally had to resort to begging for a miserable piece of cake! After some pushing here and there, the cake was finally delivered to our room at around 11pm!! This goes to show their sincerity of their service!To make things worst our experience in the Town restaurant the next day was not a pleasant one! other then the lady at the door greeting us, things went very wrong! First of all, the lady at the egg counter was friendlier to a westerner then to asians! when serving us, she had a \what the hell you want\"" face and was rather cold towards us. When the said westerner came to her for egg, she serviced him with the widest smile, warmest service you can asked from her, as if she had won a million dollars from lottery. That was a sharp difference from the experience we had gotten just mere seconds ago! The waiters/waitresses in the restaurant all had sulky face, which makes you somewhat feel unwelcomed! The worst is the jams on the table for customers was inconsistent! some tables had 4 different jams, some has 3, some has 2, while on others, there are none! Such terrible service is unimaginable from a 5 star establishment, where they make you pay more then SGD50 per head for their buffet breakfast!In our short 24 hour stay here, the amount of hippcups we received is unimaginable for a 5 star establishment! It is like paying for first class air tickets, yet received budget airlines service standards! Having said that, some of the budget carriers probably have better services when compared to Fullerton! So stay here if you want to receive sub standard services, if not save the money and stay elsewhere!!""",187
Fullerton,3,“Good but not great”,"I was expecting something different from this hotel after seeing it being featured in lots of travel TV program and was highly reviewed. There isn't.Location is a plus for the hotel as its located in the heart of the financial district. Most banks / financial institutions are within walking distance, MRT station is 2 minutes walk away.There are a number of historical landmarks nearby along the river, taking a stroll in the morning / evening should be nice.At check-in I was told that my room doesn't have an outside view, the windows actually have a view of the interior space of the lounge / main lobby area, and I MUST pay extra for one with view outside. They couldn't be bothered if its my first stay with the hotel nor am booked under corporate, bad first impression.The room was kind of small and felt a bit cramped. Breakfast buffet food quality was good, not great. There is definitely room for improvement here. Service staff was good, but not great.It was a nice experience overall but wasn't something great. For the price paid (~USD230++), its OK I think.",139
Fullerton,3,“Luxury but abit old”,"I stayed in this hotel with my parents for 2 nights. I was actually abit disappointed that we have large rooms with large windows but absolutely no view at all. We choose \courtyard\"" when we booked the hotel, thinking the room will be facing somewhere with gardens but it turns out to be nth...nth at all..just facing inside the hotel. My shower in the bathtub is not working..and you can see it's becos it lacks of maintenance. They have the smallest swimming pool I ever seen, but the view is nice. Breakfast are good. Staff are all very helpful and professional. Location is very good with restaurants and bars nearby. MRT is just 5 mins away from the hotel. I think overall experience is good...but would love trying another hotel, or may be the newer Fullerton Bay next time.""",224
Fullerton,3,“Very good but not worth the price?”,"Our room was very large and lovely but had no view. There is a wall about six feet from the window, so we got daylight but could see nothing. As far as I can see their website does not mention that some rooms have no view at all. This wasn't a problem for us as we've been to Singapore many times, but if you were on a once in a lifetime trip it would be a big disappointment. The room itself was massive and very well equiped, Unfortunately the bed was like a rock, a decent night's sleep you do not get. If only hotels such as the Fullerton would recogize that not all their guests are grossly obese and some need springs suitable for people of a healthy weight.The hotel has a great location and the public areas are very impressive. We had a corporate deal with breakfast for myself. Breakfast for my partner was around SD 52 which is very expensive. There was a lot of choice at breakfast but the quality wasn't that good with cheapo cornflakes and tasteless eggs.In summary if money's no object and you have one of the best rooms then the Fullerton will be very impressive and convenient. If you're just looking for a 5* hotel I think there are others that offer more for your money.",604
Fullerton,3,“Leave your arm and leg at the check in counter”,"We had booked a quick overnight stay on our way back to Australia at the Pan Pacific (to break or long air journey), but had to rethink when PP closed for a makeover. We paid a fair bit more to stay in 5 Star luxury at The Fullerton because it offered us a (very) late check out (4pm). We had often walked past the impressive colonial exterior and wondered what luxury lay beneath the facade so we took a chance. We paid extra for a Quay view room (as many Tripadvisor reviews had warned the atrium rooms weren't that great) and we wanted to lay in bed and watch the world go by. As it turned out the room had a high balcony wall, with a flower box containing bougainvilleas and my wife had to stand on tip toes to see over them. The service at The Fullerton could not be faulted and that's obviously what discerning travellers pay for. The room however was disappointing. It was very cramped. While there was plenty of wardrobe space it seemed like they just simply put too much furniture in a small room. We didn't even have enough room to open both of our suitcases anywhere (except on the bed). By contrast the bathroom was huge with a massive bath set in a large tiled surround. The bath had the best view! As it was nearly midnight when we arrived and as we despise airline food we were hungry when we settled in so ordered room service. Service was extremely prompt and couteous and the food quality was impressive, but a simple club sandwich was $29S++. Then we took a look at the mini-bar price list and thought $16S++ was a little over the top for a small can of beer. The only big negative with our stay was that the flush button on the toilet didn't work and they had to send a maintenance worker up to our room at 1 am. We didn't expect that to happen (it didn't break after we arrived - it was like it when we got there).Breakfast was a gala experience with everything possible at the buffet (except poached eggs which were an ala carte extra). The restaurant was huge and on various levels, so we walked off the breakfast just getting around the room. It was packed, so obviously very popular. Our room rate included breakfast so we were surprised when we were asked to sign the bill. At $90S++ for 2 people it was certainly the most expensive buffet breakfast we had ever experienced. Luckliy they didn't charge us for it when we checked out.The hotel lobby is just as impressive on the inside at the facade suggests. Grand open spaces and huge columns in the atrium. Very impressive, if a little confusing. We had to seek directions from the Concierge to find the check in counter.We didn't partake in high tea, but wished we had. It looked great and the ambience was magnificent.All in all we were disappointed, we expected more for our spend, but have to say again the service was the best we had experienced anywhere. The bell hops and doorman putting their hands out for tips all the time was a little distracting.Would we stay there again? Probably not. It's an experience not to be missed, and if money is no object and you can afford a suite then live it up. For the average traveller it's a bit over the top. I wanted to impress my wife with a luxurious final night of our holiday and it sadly failed to hit the mark.",184
Fullerton,3,“Unimpressive and over priced”,"We stayed for two nights on transit. My expectations were high. The hotel is starting to date and we found the bed in the room to be very uncomfortable. The views from the rooms are not great and to get a good view costs a lot! You are better off staying just outside of town for a lot less and much better view. The pool does not have much shade or chairs, and looks over the river not the city, not great. The service is old fashioned and a little by the book. I got a call at 4:30pm on afternoon asking me how was my stay. I complained about the service when we checked in (had a twin beds not a king bed and had to wait an hour at 11pm to fix it) and that the bed was uncomfortable, but they kinda ignored my comments and asked if anything was wrong now? I said, no. They hung up. A complete waste of my time and unnecessary interruption. All in all, I think you can do better elsewhere in Singapore for the price.",85
Fullerton,3,“Something going wrong?”,"I came back to the Fullerton hotel last week. The room was not ready (i arrived 6.30 in the morning, but this is the time you arrive if you flight from Italy). When the room was booked was been said i'd need a late check out (SQ flights leave from Singapore to Italy late in the night) but i've had to pay an extra night!Something's going wrong? I hope this (not so nice) will not happen again when i go back to singapore next time.",55
Fullerton,3,“Time for a refurb......”,"Great service,excellent breeakfast,great views .......SHABBY rooms..what a shame.This used to be a great hotel,now it is just average.The staff are courteous,the public spaces good,the location excellent.....how how the rooms let this place dowm.Scratched tables,stained carpets,poorly presented soaps and gels in old boxes.......This place needs an overhaul.....and it used to be my favourite place in town.....",135
Fullerton,3,"“Over-rated, but not terrible”","Pleasant enough hotel, but not stellar. The rooms are highly variable. Ones by the road are terrible - very noisy and I'd rather stay just about anywhere else. The courtyard rooms are quiet, but obviously have no views. The bottom line is the hotel is just too close to the main road right outside, making it ridiculously noisy for most of the rooms.The breakfast is also, frankly, disappointing, Nothing special, Very average, in terms of food If you do have breakfast, sit outside as the view is delightful. But the food (surely the main point for breakfast?) is average.I am surprised, as I have had Sunday brunch a few times at this hotel, which is great. Perhaps different chefs, or different business model. (In other words, breakfast eaters are captive, brunch guests have free will).",498
Fullerton,3,“Does great location beat room comfort?”,"Fullerton Hotel has a great location. As a long time fan of Singapore and a frequent traveler to this city nation, we wanted to try Fullerton as a change this year from our long time favorite Mandarin Oriental. The minute we stepped into our room (Quay Room on the 4 th floor, #467) we noticed a bad smell due to humidity. Our hostess said this was due to the air conditioning being turned off while the room was unoccupied. We turned the air on and settled down. However, trouble continued when we decided to take a shower and a nap before dinner. Our room which we requested to be a quiet room when we booked it almost a month ago was facing the river and had a nice view but the noise from the pool area a few floors down made it impossible for us to take a nap. When we called the front desk and reminded our requests for a quiet room and their assurances, the response was annoying. The front desk insisted that tbeir manager has checked and that there was no noise in the pool area. Our troubles continued into the evening when the party in the room next to us continued past midnight and we finally had to call the front desk again, this time begging them to please do something about the noise so we could get some rest. It was around 1 am when the party finally ended and we were allowed to sleep. This is our second day and we are stuck in the club lounge writing this review instead of taking a nap in our room after spending time in the art museum and walking around town. Our room is too noisy from the pool area below and unfortunately our plans for this four day stay in Singapore this year is ruined due to Fullerton's dishonest assurances about meeting our request for a quiet room. Would we come back to Fullerton next year? The answer is, no. Are we happy about the location of the hotel? Yes, but if you are not rested what difference does it make to be at a nice location. On a more positive note, the breakfast in the club lounge was satisfactory but the lounge is small, so, be ready to get in line to wait for your turn. The afternoon tea is also satisfactory. The staff is attentive, nice and friendly. In conclusion, if you are looking for a comfortable room where you can rest after a day out in town (in Singapore, which is hot and humid all the time, returning to a cool, quiet room is ever more important than in any other city), then this is not the place for your next stop in Singapore. When we asked to change our room so that we won't have to face the pool and the river, we were told that the rooms facing the ocean are even more noisy due to the traffic.",185
Fullerton,3,“Interesting room options.....?”,"We arrived late into Singapore and obviously went straight to the hotel and straight to bed. When we woke up the next morning we went to open the curtains to find that our room looked directly onto the hotel restaurant with no natural light and rooms looking directly into ours. For myself personally no natural light is a dfeal breaker and went down and expressed this in a kind manner and was tod that I would need to upgrade to the next level to get a window with natural light, dissapointed but willing to cough up the extra $$$. We moved to a smaller room with a view and a small terrace which was a much more practical layout and I was happy.I would definitley not book this hotel unless I was guaranteed a room with light? The service was good, the chinese restaurant was good, post bar was quite good, the service could be improved as I sat outside and had to continually attract waiters from inside.Good wifi, small but functional pool and good location to the business district and Clarke Quay. Over 5.5/10.",86
Fullerton,2,“Old and gloomy”,"From the outside, the building is unique. However, this hotel hasn't retained any colonial charm. It's an old building with some rooms facing inwards overlooking the immense lobby. My room was in a corner of the building with 4 small windows in odd places. It was dark, gloomy and very dusty (particularly the inside of the cupboards and drawers). The prevailing smell of dampness and cigarette smoke did not improve the overall experience. Head for the new Fullerton Bay Hotel instead. It's just across the street.",512
Fullerton,3,"“Beautiful with a great location, but living off its reputation”","There are plenty of competitors in Singapore now, and you'd be better off choosing one. Each time I stay here I find it goes downhill, so I'm actually going to recommend our company remove it from the approved list.Yes, it has a wonderful location.Yes, it is beautiful.Yes, it is historic.Yes, it has an amazing breakfast buffet.But that it is. This place is living on its history.Once I had to wait 40 minutes to check in at midnight. Most long hauls arrive in the middle of the night, so why not be prepared?When most flights into Singapore land late at night, you'd expect to be able to get a late check-out, especially when your company puts hundreds of people there each month. They don't care. Off you go to fend for yourself (they'll hold the bags, of course) for the 7-10 hours before your flight leaves after your checkout time. And, if you have to work (as I typically do) you must check out first thing in the morning to make their cut-off time.This hotel is infected with so much that has infected Singapore recently: Mainland China fever. They know they can get the cash (and it is cash) from mainlanders, so they don't give two hoots about the rest of us.My room in mid-November was S$600/night because they were \full.\"" Why? Nothing going on! That is more than it cost during Chinese New Year! The room was a larger-than-normal room, but the view was of another building. Whoop-di-do.I found the St. Regis at $441/night (not as central) and the Raffles at $650/night (more historic). If the hotel was full, it was full of ghosts. At 7am (peak work time) there were just 4 other people eating breakfast. At 8pm the spa was empty (don't bother) as was the gym. There was nobody in the lobby or the lobby bar when I got back from the office at 7:30pm. I've never been in an emptier sold-out hotel in my life.The room service meals have gotten out-of-control expensive, even on an expense account. There are no side salads or side dishes at all. S$30 for spaghetti bolognese, S$34 for a burger, S$40 for fish & chips, and S$25 for a Caesar salad. There is no wine or hard liquor in the mini bar, but there are a couple of beer offerings.I asked about the hotel car to go to the office, since it is an S$5 ride (you take a cab all the time due to the heat & humidity), but I was told it was S$110. Seriously? For a 5-minute ride? They did that for free at the Mandarin in Singapore (which has a better spa).I would expect that rooms in a 5- or 6-star hotel would keep cool when you're out (after all, you're paying for it), but the AC goes off when you leave the room, so you return hot & sweaty to a hot & steamy room. There is no excuse for that.I'm a seller of this property until this Mainland China bubble crashes, because they need an attitude adjustment.""",87
Fullerton,3,"“very disappointing, not a five star hotel quality”","First of all, i requested for a king size bed and they gave me a room with 2 twins bed without consulting me first. Asked them to set up morning calls, there were no calls in the morning. Very sloppy services in general. Took forever for the luggaged to be delivered, for bell desk to answer the phone. Everthing in the hotel just seem a bit old, and the room wasn't cleaned very thoroughly, at least not the same cleaning quality compared to other 5 starts hotel.",200
Fullerton,3,“So many contrasts ......”,"I'm not sure how to write this review as there were so many contrasts. On one hand, the hotel was as beautiful as always and wonderfully maintained. Staff in general were exemplary and the hotel looks every bit the top line five star establishment that it is.On the other hand, there were annoying little things. On arrival, my room wasn't what I had requested and it took ages for them to address this. In the end, I simply demanded another room that was in line with what I had booked in the first place and there simply was more fuss about that than should have occurred. The second issue was there was a water leakage issue in the room which was running under carpet. I asked for them to look at this and over a stay of a few days, it wasn't fixed. In a hotel of this quality, I would have expected they would have moved us to another room. I do like the Fullerton and have stayed there on previous occasions so this may have been an aberration. Previously, I would have rated it five stars but on this occasions, they lose a couple due to those issues.",136
Fullerton,3,“Fullerton Htl during F1”,"The Fullerton hotel is situated fantastic for the formular 1 race and it is in general a nice hotel. Price compared with other hotel options and the fact that we had a room with windows towards the inner part of the hotel (dark room as you need to have the curtain blocking the direct views into the room) is however limiting my enthusiasm.The rooms are fairly large and as you can expect (except that our room had no windows to the outside)The pool area is fine but small and with limited sun. Then bar is nice and well visited. Breakfast with some limitations is reflecting the general high level of the hotel. You can sit outside dining along the canal, a very nice setting. Internet is free as in all places in Singapore! Tree large stars.",147
Fullerton,3,“Rather dissapointing”,"Having stayed in Singapore many times we decided to take advantage of a 2 nights for the price of 1 stay at The Fullerton.The service is ok but far short of other Singapore Hotels, facilities are few but the major issue and it really is an issue is that the inside rooms (interior courtyard) smell terrible! Because they have no windows the dank smell from the airconditioning and bathroom makes the furnishings and room smell like a dirty pond...... not what one expects. We tried 4 rooms before finally upgrading to an exterior room for only a couple of nights then we cancelled our booking and moved hotels.Singapore is such a wonderful place and the Fullerton is such a key part of that visually that it really deserves to be fully refurbed internally to adress the problems and also investment in the staff training would be key.",102
Fullerton,3,“Dragged down by the original sin of volume over guest experience”,"This hotel is in a wonderfully-located historic building but they really shouldn't have maximised the number of rooms by having half of them facing into the building's covered courtyard. I've stayed twice before, at an awful second floor room looking at the bar, at a very pleasant room with a balcony facing out, and this time at a decent enough room, but as it faces in you have no idea if it's sunny or rainy outside when you wake up.Great service, nice restaurants are a compensation but my rating is dragged down by the Fullerton's original sin of volume over guest experience.",73
Fullerton,3,“Poor service”,"We stay here twice a year and have done so since the hotel opened aqnd have held a number of evening functions at the hotel.Unfortunately The Fullerton do not give any credit or attach any importance to repeat and loyal customers.We needed a late check out, but were only offered 2 hours, which is not worth a thing.The hotel is nice but the service is very poor.Shame the hotel does not value customers",344
Fullerton,3,“Something is missing”,"I always stayed in Mandarin Oriental in Singapore but I liked the architecture of the Fullerton building and decided to give it a try. Well, the next time I shall be back in Mandarin Oriental I guess. Why? There were some details which spoiled the overall experience. The building is beautiful and in a very good location (although the former harbor has changed a lot since I visited Singapore the first time 10 years ago and the sea view disappeared as a result of the Sands hotel/casino monster). The room was clean and nice (I stayed in Heritage room) but this is what you expect in 5-star hotel anyway.The swimming pool overlooking the \old Singapore\"" and Singapore river is spectacular.We were travelling with a small kid and I obviously reserved a non-smoking room but upon our arrival (very late at night) we were assigned a room which was smoking in the past (or at least some guest was smoking in the room). They apparently tried to clean it but once somebody is smoking in a room with a carpet and fabric upholstery that room retain the typical smell for a very long time. I reported it to the front desk and they offered another room but something like this should not happen in the 5-star hotel in the first place. Also, the WC started to leak the water on the floor during our stay.Couple days after departure I received an electronic questionnaire about my stay, reported the problems and checked the box that I would like to get the response. I have never heard from the Fullerton since then.To make the long story short ... The Fullerton can be easily true 5-star property if it provides \""5-star care\"" to its customers which does not seem to be the case. Also, the staff was nice and friendly ... but lacked the nobleness of people who are proud of serving their customers (compared with Mandarin Oriental).To be fair ... the hotel provides free of charge high speed internet with an excellent bandwidth (both downlink and uplink).""",300
Fullerton,3,“Good but not heading the right way...”,"I have travelled several times to the Fullerton. I had mixed feelings about this hotel (and still do) as its not your everyday business hotel.Location is very nice and you can easily access all parts of town from there. Service is good but not that impressive (getting in the hotel with your luggage and not having anyone to hold the door is never a good first impression). The rooms are the main problem for me. If you like playing lottery, you'll be happy there. As this is (if I recall correctly) an old post office refurbished in a hotel, rooms can vary significantly in size and comfort. If you are lucky you get an outside view, if your not, you see the inside of the buidling (didn't call that a view because its not). If you face the inside, your room will look grey and light coming from outside will feel really dim. The furniture in the room is fine but looks a lot like Ikea to me. Not that I dont like the Nordic style but I would expect either something more elaborated than Ikea in a top rated hotel.The bed feels like climbing the Himalaya (seriously its the highest bed I've seen in the region). Its not a problem (you dont need a ladder no worries) but it feels strange as the comfort of the bed is good, but not that different from other hotels with lower beds!The swimming pool is great and the even though it is small (not a real swimming distance if I recall properly) its a very pleasant place to hang out and relax after a day of hard work!I have not tried the restaurants as I had breakfast lunch and dinner outside since it is walking distance from a lot of local restaurants.",183
Fullerton,2,“Disappointing”,"We stayed here for a long weekend end February 2011.There is no denying the Fullerton a beautiful hotel on the outside. However, the interior was not quite so. We had a corporate rate room with a courtyard view, which is not a view at all! While large in size, it was dark and lacked style or ambience. The decor was sparse and dull, and a little shabby. The bathroom was fine. We didn't have time to use the pool, but it looked fab. We chose not to eat at the hotel. Overall our stay was ok.But I was extremely disappointed with the 20 minute express manicure at their spa. The therapist spoke no English and seemed unsure of what to do, the end result was not good. Plus the nail area is not up to the standard you would expect in a major hotel. The furniture was tatty and the wall decoration of palm trees appallingly tacky. They could do so much better with a little effort.Given the abundant choice of luxury hotels in Singapore next time I will try another one rather than return here.",114
Fullerton,3,“Lux hotel with Dangerous maintenance”,"My wife get me a birthday present to celebrate my birthday. The hotel is nice and luxuary. Upgrade the room to have a balcony on the river side. However as a hardware consultants , I notice the Colony style Balcony door ( that door is so heavy... must be over 100Kg) with a broken door closer which function\ so well\"" than it slam shut the door no matter what kind of conditions.Upon my day of departure, enjoy my last view of the river scene, Go out and help my wife to pack her luggage. And forgot the door closer is a broken door closer.Results, Hospitial, X-ray, broken bone, and 1 month of walking Aid.""",161
Fullerton,2,“Very disappointing”,"This was supposed to be a romantic stay for myself and my wife, but too many things put a spoiler on it. I stayed for 2 nights at the Fullerton. It took a long time to check in with the check in clerk giving me a hard sell to upgrade my room at extra cost. Only after saying \No\"" 3 times did he finally check me in. Bathroom wasn't cleaned properly - still had hairs in the bath, and the plug in the sink would not hold water. The walls were scuffed & dirty near the desk and furniture in a poor state. At check out, they tried to charge me for a breakfast I'd never had, and for local calls which are shown as \""free\"" on hotels.com. I got a very curt response when I challenged the charges too.I found the location ot be good, but there's no shortage of 5 star hotels in Singapore - I'd suggest staying elsewhere.""",72
Fullerton,3,“The Fullerton has lost its shine”,"I started going to the fullerton in Singapore maybe 6 years ago and then it was a shining light of the new Singapore. Alas no longer. It is a gloomy, expensive business hotel with cranky rooms and dreary decor. There was nothing that I could praise as top-class, but nothing dreadful. It's just truly middle of the road and in need of investment if it wasnts to compete with its numerous competitors.",202
Fullerton,3,“Not up to its multiple star status - funny sounds from room”,"Stayed there for 2 nights during end February 2011. Was given room 745 - once I stepped in I could smell the sort of musty smell which indicates that the room probably was not aired in a long time. Once the airconditioning was on, the smell cleared in awhile. The room was so small - but my colleague on the 6th floor had a room that was close to twice the size of mine. I understand that the room configurations are odd as this is an old refurbished building but we were both charged the same rate. Some of the marble in the bath stall either had cracked or wasn't fitted properly that I could stick a part of my nail finger through a crack. The lobby lounges and restaurants were fine, but the rooms were not 5 star standard. What made it worse was I couldn't sleep the whole trip as I would constantly be woken up by funny creaking and droning noises from the airconditioning vent. My colleague had a better experience, but I wouldn't like to take my chances with this place (and risk getting a lousy room) the next time I'm in Singapore. Not worth the price paid.",294
Fullerton,2,“MISTAKE”,"I have been going to Singapore for the last 15 years both for business and for pleasure and during the last 10 years at least we have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. Based on the experience we had at an evening function at The Fullerton when it just opened , I was convinced to give it a try for a two night visit a few days before Christmas 2010. What a big mistake that was!! We had booked a “Loft Suite” hoping to treat my wife as this was a business stop during our Christmas holidays.The Suite was a vast two storey room with two entrances on the two different levels. The walls completely covered in magnolia colour paint without anything hanging on them to give it a bit of colour! All the furniture a complete mismatch of colour, style or some furnishings to give it some warmth. The huge balcony overlooking a main road had no furniture at all not even a chair, although I could see garden furniture in front of the other rooms. First night quite loud humming noise perhaps from some generator or aircon unit. The lobby area huge and totally indifferent with some staff trying to make you sit and have a drink and then they would get the order wrong. How can you confuse an order of red wine and instead bring a glass of white!!The place promotes its self as the splendid old Post Office building in a lovely location! From the outside it looks fantastic but once in, everything falls apart. One lesson I have learned from this….next visit its back to the Mandarin Oriental again even if I need binoculars to see the water’s edge with all the buildings and reclamation work going around it.",189
Fullerton,3,“If only they could speak english...”,"We came to the Fullerton for the New Years Eve's Celebration. The check-in was average and although the guy seemed friendly, he was unable to understand English beyond the normal \hotel check-in\"" phrases. The same \""language problem\"" was going on when we checked-out with another girl the next day, when we had breakfast next morning and so on... Why is a \""top-notch\"" international hotel like the Fullerton not taking more care when selecting the right staff ? Especially in \""customer facing\"" positions the hotel staff should be able to speak English, that the rest of the world understands. The version of English in Singapore is bad enough to negotiate with the locals on the street, but for an international hotel it is just not good enough !The breakfast buffet on New Years Day was just unorganised (maybe because it was served in one of the ballrooms instead of the restaurant). While some tables were served coffee, others had to get it themselves. The choice of food was below average for a 5-star hotel in Singapore.The room on the other hand was very nice and the \""room-service food\"" was excellent.""",131
Fullerton,3,“Not typical of the service I have come to expect from Singapore”,"Our stay was 3 days over Christmas. On arrival our first concern was to find somewhere special for Christmas lunch. Naturally we expected some help from the concierge - he told us to go to the internet and look it up. We tried the relief Concierge the next day. After promising to check for cancellations at a particular restaurant we would have liked, he promptly booked us into the 'overflow' area for lunch at the Fullerton. Subsequently we walked to the restaurant of our choice and found there was a cancellation.The Fullerton room was very small, to our surprise, and there was no information at all about either the hotel, or Singapore itself, in the room.Otherwise the staff were friendly and helpful, and the pool area was good.Wouldnt stay there again.",403
Fullerton,3,“Hotel steeped in history...but service can be improved”,"We stayed at the Fullerton Hotel over the Christmas holidays and it was an overall pleasant stay. The hotel is steeped in Singapore history and it is indeed a very impressive and stunning building. Our room overlooked the Merlion and we had gorgeous clear views of Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Esplanade both in the day and at night.Things we enjoyed:- Historic hotel with great views- Spacious rooms and very comfortable beds- Great location (accessible & convenient)- Great service and food at the Jade Restaurant- Friendly Business Services staff that helped check us into our flight- Nice Gym facilities- Front desk were eager to help when asked for local transportation, however it was odd that they did not know it off the top of their heads.Things that would have improved our stay - mainly Service:- Cleaning our room on a timely basis. We waited until 5pm for our rooms to be cleaned and were told that it was because we did not hit the \Clean our room button\"" which wasn't even working. I think a simple Do Not Disturb system would have sufficed.- Hotel lounge staff were not very friendly and were impatient when taking orders for a group of 10 (including children). Understandably we had questions about the menu as it was our 1st time in the hotel, but she seemed annoyed that she had to help us. When we questioned an order, she grew defensive insisting we had ordered it. It was simply a point of clarification, but it sure made us wonder about customer service at the Fullerton. Lounge service paled in comparison to the outstanding dinner service we received at their onsite Jade restaurant.- On Christmas day, because the restaurant that usually housed the Buffett Breakfast was full, we were moved to the ballroom in the lower level. However, we found out the next day when we were at the restaurant that the buffett selection in the restaurant had more variety and was better than what was offered to guests who were at the ballroom. Understandably Christmas is a busy time however, the hotel should have anticipated the increased number of guests. Afterall if you are increasing your rates over the holidays, I would expect at a minimum a high standard of service you would receive in non peak times. Luxury is about consistency and I think Fullerton hotel despite its good qualities still has much to improve.""",78
Fullerton,2,“Fullerc#$p”,"Yeah, no. I mean, a five star hotel with nescafe sachets? come on....are you serious?So many things wrong, the first room has a creepy whalesong song eminating from the room, could be haunted but honestly, far too too over it, just couldn't sleep. The shower sink wouldn't work so flooded the bathroom, nice touch. Moved to a new room, and the TV's busted. I currently have a technician fixing it, fnar fnar, not. Can't wait to leave. Crap.",423
Fullerton,3,"“Still good, but still not worth it”","Stayed here again for a weekend recently to see if anything had changed, mainly on the basis of a great deal through work - it hadn't Check in was ok though they tried to upsell the room to some package that didnt seem worth it - They had already messed up the airport collection (i had booked a limo cab, never turned up) - They did apologise but that was the last i heard about it Room was nice, with a view over the river towards Boat Quay - however it was clearly a twin with the beds pushed togoether which made sleeping a little uncomforatble (mattress is also like a waterbed, pillows useless fyi) - the furniture was quite worn, and badly laid out - and the TV too small given its so far from the bed - Bathroom was fine, decent size but only one sink which seemed a waste of space - miserable threadbare towels though, and not nearly enough of them - poor all, and i mean ALL, food and drink are crazy money (though to be fair, the breakfast is excellent quality) - the pool remains a highlight, but its lounge area is very small and you need to be quick to get a sun lounger - again, a bite and drink here is crazy money - $20 for 2 glasses of milk from room service, a beer is US$15, breakfast is around $US45 as a guide - this is BEFORE 10% service, and 7% tax we also had two, what i thought to be, poor intrusions (though one was self inflicted) - first off we had a early evening snooze disturbed by someone asking us were we having a nice stay? (try not calling the room without a good reason, like the hotel is on fire!) - the second was the door buzzing at 7.55 AM on Sunday morning with some laundry - that'll teach me to put the do not disturb light on i guess! - still no one should be ringing the door before 10am unless its breakfast now, i understand that if you are staying here that value is not a top priority, but still i have stayed in lots of other hotels in this city of the same standard, and very rarely do i walk out feeling i have been ripped off - unforutnately that is exactly the feeling i got checking out here - there are better quality, better positioned, better value hotels in Sing - i won't be back anytime soon",273
Fullerton,2,“Room for Improvement”,"We stopped off in Singapore for a night en route to Vietnam and decided to stay at the Fullerton to see what it was like. We arrived quite late and noticed that it took over 20 minutes for the bags to get to our room. The room was quite nice but the bed was very hard and I found that I could not sleep comfortably. This is not usually a problem with hotels in Singapore.The next morning we went downstairs to get breakfast. The restaurant was seriously understaffed, We found our own way to a table, with no one to explain how the system worked or what options we had. We went to the buffet and had some fruit and toast and managed to order to coffee after a while from a waiter. I asked for a bill and was disturbed to see that we had been charged about S$110 for 2 full American breakfasts. I signed it but went to a waitress and said it was not reasonable and asked her to change to charge to a continental breakfast. She said she would. They were very busy so we did not wait. When we checked out 1 hour later I asked about the breakfast charge and was told there was no charge. Much to my surprise I was charged about AUS$93 several weeks later on my credit card. I queried it but the charge went through. This was the most expensive continental breakfast we have ever eaten.I would not recommend this hotel and warn people to check what they will be charged - if they can find a member of staff !",168
Fullerton,3,“WE BOOKED A ROOM FOR TRIPLE !!!!!”,"Although we booked a room for triple, there were only two beds inside the room when we checked in, and only two bathrobes, two slippers, two toothbrushes and so, everything was arranged only for two people. It was in the evening, not the early morning. The receptionist who took us to the room said they would arrange it right away but nobody had come even after 30mins passed, that we had to ring the reception and ask them to send somebody. BUT, suppose, they didn't understand we needed everything for one more person,that we had to ask again and again for each things which had to be arranged before we checked in, because not only one department arrange the rooms for the guests at that hotel, every man who came said \that's not our department.\"" Can you believe that kind of service in 5 star hotel?? Other than that, we had nice stay with very nice breakfast, the location was pretty good, close to Merlion and metro station""",230
Fullerton,3,“Fantastic location & View - but we felt fleeced with the prices charged”,"We loved Singapore, and the location of the Fullerton is second to none. Fantastic views from the quay view room. Walk out to Boat Quay to the bars and restaurants, and again a short walk around to the hawkers food stalls on Lau Pa Sat. Rooms are comfortable. The hotel is huge, and it can be overwhelming, so if you like smaller, 5-star boutique hotels, then this hotel is not for you. Service is very good at the restaurant and the doors. But when we wanted to sample the afternoon tea at 36 singapore dollars per person, the lobby area had reserved seats only, though they were empty and then we were actually turned away by staff. Reserved for whom? Not hotel guests it seems, but for corporate suits who had yet to occupy them. I couldn't believe it. This is not the way to treat your staying guests. 28 dollars for wired only internet use for 24 hours also struck me as outrageous, and we complained about this in person and in writing. 16 dollars for a pot of tea is also steep.That said, we were facilitated to have an early check-in, and a late check-out on our departure. I haven't made my mind up whether or not to return to this hotel in the future and give them my custom. Sorry Fullerton, but you need to do better.",129
Fullerton,3,"“Iconic building and looks great from outside, but starting to get tired looking inside”","We had a great stay in Singapore for a long weekend at the Fullerton, right in the middle of where the new part of Singapore is starting to thrive.

No complaints about staff or cleanliness - all in order, but just felt like the Fullerton Bay across the road had had all the money spent on it and they were forgetting about the original!Rooms were big enough, but try and get a view on the outside as ours looked annoyingly inside...

I'm sure if you can be guaranteed a river view suite it would be a totally different experience - but make sure it is confirmed before you go!",26

I couldn't believe how rude the staff were on our last stay and also how slovenly dressed they were - I have visited cafes where the staff were cleaner! They are rude and their attitude is one of 'could not care less' - this hotel has gone SO downhill it is hard to belive how they keep their 5 star rating - it is obviously the location and the building - both stunning - but have nothing to do with how the hotel is being run today. Service in the hotel is practically non existant - cannot deliver on room service for hours and staff in restaurant really do not care whether you have seats, food or drinks - it all seems too much for them!

We opted for the buffet breakfast so that we didn't have to go hunting for breakfast every morning with the little one in tow, not knowing what she'd decide to eat or not. The buffet in the hotel was decent. Since my daughter's a fussy eater and this was her first visit outside her country, she'd closed up more on what she frugally ate. One day she'd enjoy the omelette but the other day she'd refuse to eat a morsel! The lady in charge one of those days was helpful to pack her breakfast so that she could have it at her own time later, but the very next day another man in charge made it seem like a big problem when we requested for her breakfast to be packed!!! Anyways talked to the concerned people and they were prompt in sorting it out. The other thing I found odd was the fact that my in-laws staying on the 3rd floor had a bathroom with a tub and weighing scale in it. Whereas mine on the 5th floor had neither! Naturally the kid was upset about her baths. These things could have been pointed at the reception while they were allocating us the rooms.

How can they explain that a link from \""book in advance and save with breakfast included \"" can show rate without BF. In any case separate rate was not shown for any type of room on this linked page. This is a worst fraud at Corporate level which I have experienced in my life.Bed linens are not changed even if you give specific request for the same to guest services manager. They have devised several ways of not changing bed linen in the name of environment protection.

Food courts are lots cheaper compared to dining at restaurants where you have to pay 10% service charge (even if there is no service!) plus 7% VAT. We booked a Premier room with 2 double beds. We were advised at check-in there would be a cot for our baby, but it wasn't there. There wasn't enough room for it anyway. The room was comfortable.One interesting incident though. We had a staff helping us taking our luggage (a 20kg checked-in suitcase and 1 cabin luggage) to our room. Given that we just came straight from the airport we didn't have change to tip him. To 'retaliate' he signalled other staff not to help us with our luggage when we checked out. Well... On the brighter side we could save that tip for someone else on our next trip.",55
HolidayInn,3,“Solid 3/5”,"Lets start with the positives - Clean, great staff, and my oh my what a location! 2 minute walk from Orchard Road. There are no negatives per se... its just that it was a good hotel, not a great one. No wow - factor. But for the price, its a good place to stay :)",99
HolidayInn,3,“Skip club straight to ordinary room”,Great location just off Orchard road but was a bit disappointed with having a premier/club class room. The lounge is in the atrium and was a bit open and impersonal but the worst aspect was that its packed at 'happy hour ' time. I travel a lot and usually stay in rooms at thislevel but have never seen such a busy lounge.I would stick to an ordinary room next time and not upgrade. If you want to spend extra it would be better to go elsewhere.Was worried about the noise as its next to a freeway but heard nothing.,166
HolidayInn,2,“Sleep deprived”,"I have stayed at this Holiday Inn a number of times and sadly this time we were given a room on the 6th floor parallel to Kramat Rd (facing Orchard Rd) and next to a nightclub. The music, or the loud dull thud commenced at about 8 pm and pounded along until 5 - 6 am. Even with the tv on as a naive attempt at 'white noise' the sound was enough to drive me slowly mad - ear plugs too didn't work. So caution if making a booking here. Staff need to be advising patrons of this and maybe offer these awful rooms at a significantly discounted rate. The hotel is otherwise fine - a very nice and well kept pool and area - well done Gibson. Rooms are clean and well appointed. The hotel is close to Orchard Rd and many places to eat, shop and explore. I would need to be assured of a non noisy room before I committed to here again.",232
HolidayInn,3,“Booked due to 8/10 ratings - a bit disappointing though for us all”,"To start with - we booked & paid for 3 adults to share a King room with the assumption that our adult daughter would have a single or rollaway bed but upon check-in were told that we were all sharing the King bed - together! Not happy at all & the female @ reception was quite cold & unfriendly as she advised that we had in fact paid for 3 adults to use all the facilities of the room but we hadn't in fact paid for an extra bed - weird! We were then offered a room with 2 x double beds which we begrudgingly accepted. All-in-all the room was okay - nothing fantastic but fairly comfortable - although we did change rooms on the second day to one with a park view (much better outlook). Pillows were weird - Memory foam was a tiny square foam....Staff on the whole were pleasant. Cleaners came through @ 8am every morning!Considering that nothing was open until 10am & we had late nights, this was way too early even for us early risers. Pool area was quite nice & gym not bad. Restaurants way too expensive. We are very much used to staying @ 4.5 star hotels & sleeping in a king size bed, so would probably not return to this hotel. Nice return holiday to Singers but not an 8/10 hotel - no way!",139
HolidayInn,3,“Okay but not suitable for honeymooners”,"We arrived on a late flight and we greeted nicely and told we received a free upgrade on room but not escorted to our room so we took our luggage up and amenities not explained. Got to our room to find a congratulations card, cake, chocolates and champagne on water which was lovely but do not how long it was sitting there and from the unfrozen ice figured it was awhile so did not enjoy any of it. The room and bed was okay but nothing special and the choice of different pillows was nice. Found the pricing of food and drinks at the bar to be a bit excessive. The executive lounge was spacious compared to some I have been too but found there was not enough tables and chairs for all patrons to enjoy there own space.",114
HolidayInn,3,“An updated modernized Holiday Inn with new rooms”,"This Holiday Inn is one of the more recently refurbished properties and had a brand new lobby with newly refurbished rooms. The room is pretty good-sized and is up to the standard of other Holiday Inn properties in Asian Pacific region. However this was a slight moldy smell when we walked in, and the room could use a de-humidifier. Nonetheless I was impressed with how modern the property is. The service at the front desk was a mixed bunch, but most of them are trying. Compared to Holiday Inn in the US, this Holiday Inn is definitely impressive. The price of course is a bit higher, but nothing too surprising given this is Singapore.",82
HolidayInn,2,“Messy and unprofessional”,"Stayed here for 5 days, housekeeping was unclean (they replaced the towels with dirty ones) and reorganized belongings according to their liking, knocking over piles of organized papers of mine and obviously failing to organize them again. Terrible internet connection issues that were fixed on the last two days of our stay. Breakfast was mediocre, average for a business hotel, and staff were unprofessionally loud and unhelpful with the exception of a concierge. However, bedding was very comfortable and a good location.",129
HolidayInn,3,“Great rooms”,We stayed two nights at the Holiday Inn on our way to Europe and it served it's purpose well enough. The rooms are very well appointed and I'd say the best part of this hotel. We had a park view room with two double beds which was very nice. The bathroom was very nicely finished and had everything you could want. I found the public areas of the hotel including the Club Lounge a little dated and was expecting better to be honest. The food and beverage in the Club Lounge was just average and the food seemed well picked over the two evenings we visited. The staff were very friendly and helpful however next time I'm in Singapore I may pay a little extra for a different hotel.,200
HolidayInn,2,“Great location but poorly maintained”,"This is my 3rd visit and the previous 2 stays were both pleasant, on this occasion I was not too impressed. On our arrival, the staff were not too welcoming and although check in was fast, I had a room on the 5th floor with a bad odor and stale. We requested a change, but again the room next door had 2 beds lopsided on each side. Decided to change the third time and finally got a decent room but still look jaded, and I thought is this how they treat an IHG member? The bed sheet had stains on them, towels felt hard and dry and the free WiFi in room was slow and pathetic. Rooms were dusty even after cleaning and bathroom amenities were inadequate, the shower needs to be replaced. The water in the rooftop pool looks murky at times, and the gym equipment looked worn out. Despite repeated apologies from the staff, housekeeping was never efficient and we were glad to leave after 3 days. The best thing is it is located on Orchard Road and next to street food and restaurants. A total refresh is long overdue in my opinion before it loses it's value.",401
HolidayInn,1,“Never again”,"I stayed there for 5 days , i will try to mention the bad and the good in my experience Good : location is 2 minutes from main orchard road , rooms are spacious , sleep quality was one of the best among the hotels i visited worldwide .Breakfast variety was good but i will talk later about breakfast Bad : room towels were replaced by housekeeping staff with more dirty ones that has stains , internet connection in the room is free wifi that doesn't work at all and when i selected the paid faster one it didn't work at all also and when i contacted the staff in charged the problem was solved after few trials and as a gesture it was given to me complementary .The housekeeping staff messes up our stuff and they changed the order of our personal printed photos that we were keeping in order during our travel fro the previous 2 weeks!!Check in was very slow because the staff was under training or new or something while checkout was more disaster ,after we checked out we had to remind them again about our bags in the room , it took us 30 minutes to get over with the check out and having our bags downstairs .As mentioned above the breakfast variety was good but as a muslim i was really disappointed that when i asked the Manager in the restaurant about the food he confirmed that it is ok for muslims and the beef and chicken were slaughtered according to muslims sharea , i was shocked next day when i came to find a paper beside the food saying it is not for muslims \ not Halal\"", finally the manager in the restaurant in my opinion talks tooooo much and he is loud , he needs to stop .also the juice cups in breakfast were dirty every day.Oh and by the way this is the first hotel where i found laundry staff knocking the door asking for laundry !, if i have laundry i would keep it normally in the bag why do i have to be reminded ? This is a hotel not a motel Overall sorry to say the i do believe as a club member in IHG that this hotel didn't at all meet any of my expectations and it needs IHG Management attention , there is a Management issue there""",54
HolidayInn,3,“Location good but touristy and average in all other areas!”,"This hotel is well situated for shopping and is near by cab to most visitor sites. However, for the price it lacks any real finesse. Service is ok, concierge are largely apathetic and room service is average. My advice would be pay a little bit extra for a better experience nearer to the marina.",72
HolidayInn,3,“Great location on Orchard Street - but a bit expensive”,"The location of this hotel is really the main point. Staff is professional and efficient, and the hotel is super clean. However the rooms are really small, and the general price is really high compared to similar hotels i have been in Singapore. I would probably not return. One great plus was the pool which is very long. There is also a bubble bath but i would question it given the smell.",111
HolidayInn,3,“All was excellent until the last breakfast”,"This hotel is very clean, conveniently located, and with excellent staff (reception, Executive Lounge staff, and cleaning staff). The reason my review is not excellent was the service lady at the 2nd floor restaurant. Being Royal Ambassador members, we always had breakfast in the lounge, but this morning we had to take breakfast in the restaurant due to an early flight. The lady serving the restaurant asked everyone she met if they wanted coffee and checked on them to see if everything was fine. She passed by our table several times without even a \good morning\"". I don't know what that was about, but she lost review points for the hotel.""",146
HolidayInn,3,“Good hotel close to orchard”,"Currently staying for a week at this Holiday inn orchard. The hotel is at the back of centrepoint mall. Not too many desirable stores in this mall but the plus side is, they have the cold storage supermarket and a McDonald. Good enough for me. I can access orchard road from McDonald but still a bit of a walk if I wanted to go to takashimaya or paragon. Rooms are very clean. Buffet breakfast was ok too afternoon tea was always ala carte with a few sandwiches (not really tasty) and the same fried chicken. Food during evening cocktails was better.Taxi from this hotel to jurong bird park was around sin$18.00 one way. Somerset station was the closest but with the heat and a baby, still took the taxi for convenience. Somerset was still a bit of a walk in orchard road.Overall, ok hotel for me.",71
HolidayInn,3,“A very good hotel”,"A very good hotel, conviently located for shopping, but also the transport linksThe room was a decent size, with a comfy bed and all the mod cons that you need. We recieved some chocolate covered strawberries on arrival in our room and also a free drinks token to use at the bar :-)Staff were helpful and showed us how to get to all the parts of singapore we wanted to visit.",93
HolidayInn,3,“Average”,There was no surprise with this HI – both good or bad. I love the location and its small size. The wall is a bit thin and I could hear the TV of my neighbor. My reservation included free WIFI and breakfast but the checkin clerk said they were extra. I showed them a printout of my booking confirmation and ultimately I did not have to pay.The breakfast buffet offered a good variety but the food was just average. The drip coffee was horrible but I was glad they had freshly squeezed juice.,91
HolidayInn,3,“Average/good hotel - good location”,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in June, 2013. The hotel is in a very good location with respect to Orchard Road. The rooms are okay - nothing special but okay. The breakfast was served for 4 hours and was quite good. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Overall, I found this hotel to be a typical non-descript hotel....clean, functional, good....but it was a bit expensive (over $300 per night). I would not hesitate to stay there again if I were just looking for something simple and good.",66
HolidayInn,3,“Good hotel but way too expensive”,"We stayed one night in this hotel and the location of it is very good (close to Orchard Street, Metro station), but in our opinion for being a Holiday Inn it is overpriced - yes, yes we know it is Singapore, but anyway. Our room was beautiful and well served. The breakfast in the club lounge was very good. All the staff were friendly and helpful.",163
HolidayInn,3,“Terrible airfreshner smell in room”,"Stayed in a twin room 457 on the 25th and 26th of May ,when we arrived around 10pm there was a loud band playing in the bar off the lobby which was deafening and hardly a classy look for this hotel.On entering our room there was a contraption gurgling away on the floor pumping out this disgusting toilet smelling air freshener,we unplugged it but the nauseus smell pervaded the room the entire time we were here,we did not complain as the check in clerk told us we had the last twin room available in the hotel.The room itself was fine,but would advise anyone staying here to check their room before accepting it.Our booking was made many months in advance and a non smoking room was requested,so we hope the deodouriser was not to get rid of a smoking smell,but can only assume it was!!!Really this hotel has to lift it,s game this sort of nonsense is not acceptable in a country like Singapore.",75
HolidayInn,3,"“Good location, disappointing breakfast”","Good location, only 20 meters walk to Orchard Road and another 10m to Sommerset MRT from the back entrance (not taxi/car entrance), so it's very convenient. Taxis are easy to get. Rooms are great, quiet, pillows are comfortable, room condition is quite new and DVD player is included. Breakfast are very disappointing, only a very small choice of food and they put pork and beef/chicken very close, for someone who doesn't eat pork it's disturbing.",259
HolidayInn,3,“Only the room was missing...”,I traveled to Singapore with my family (husband and two children). That means that we had a really long flight behind when we arrived in Holiday Inn hotel. It was already evening and they didn't have a room for us! They offered a room with one double bed for us four instead of the room I had reserved. We told that's not possible so they started to look for an extra bed. At 9 pm they told us they have a bed so we can check in the room and they'll bring the bed right away. Our kids we really tired and at 10 pm I started calling and asking where the bed is. It took many calls and a really angry conversation with the manager until they brought the bed at 11 pm. I was so angry and told them we want some discount for this. So when we had our last night there I went to the reception and wanted to pay our bill so we would have enough time to get to the airport next morning. I was really dissappointed when they offered us a free transport to the airport. I told them that is not enough and after long conversation we got a decent discount. I think they didn't succeed at all in this.The rooms were clean and ok. The pool is really nice especially in the evening. Location is exellent. I was a bit dissappointed with the breakfast and also with the Indian restaurant. The manager of the restaurant was rude and acting weirdly.,79
HolidayInn,3,"“Good Hotel , Perfect Location!!!”",Staying at the Holiday inn after long - a bit disappointed as we had booked and requested for 2 rooms with king size beds (coz we were 2 families with a child each) but no rooms were available.Service was good - very helpful staff.Breakfast - was ok !ordered Room service - food was not served hot :(Hotel - Location was perfect jus off orchard road -but was a bit pricy! will look for options before i chose this hotel!,56
HolidayInn,3,“Don't pay for executive deal”,Nice hotel. Staff helpful but not entirely honest. Just don't bother to pay for the Executive Lounge upgrade.Exec lounge is a pit in the foyer of surrounding floors with no view and no ambience. High tea was Low Ball. Food was awful & only machine coffee and soft drinks on the menu. Nothing High about it.,87
HolidayInn,3,“Reasonable value hotel”,"Compared to the prices of other business hotels in Singapore this is good value and it is a comfortable, well located hotel. Rooms are a little tired but for the price given the costs of Singapore they are acceptable. Breakfast service however left a little to be desired, on a number of occasions staff forgot to bring me items that they had offered to bring to the table (coffee, juice etc.). I find this annoying as I would prefer not to be asked and not be disappointed.",141
HolidayInn,3,“Hotel with Good Rooms but Poor Service.”,"Stayed at Holiday Inn, Singapore during july last year with my wife while coming back from Bali. The check in procedure took hours, and finally when the room was allotted they had given us a room with twin beds which one would not expect on their honeymoon. Well the rooms were good with all the facilities. The location of the hotel was also good as its quiet close to Orchard Rd. The worst part was that at the time of check in they had asked us to deposit 100$ which was refundable and was charged against any consumption in mini bar. We checked out of the hotel without taking that amount and the hotel also conveniently forgot to refund the money. The amount is not huge but i feel that it was the hotel's responsibility to remind us about the refund.",1434
HolidayInn,3,“4-week stay - Jan/Feb 2013”,"Booked a four-week stay here while visiting Singapore mainly on business (from the US). Main reason for the booking was the good location with regards to Orchard Road and the reviews I read which stated most would receive upgrade to Executive level upon checking-in which gives you access to the lounge for free drinks and appetizers every day (among other things such as free laundry, DVD rental, etc.) . I however was not upgraded even though I stayed for four weeks (a lot of money!). My opinion:Location - Few minutes walk to Orchard Road where there is tons of shopping and restaurants. Let it be known however, that for Westerners there is a pretty limited amount of restaurants on Orchard Road that cater to our normal cuisine. Also, everything on Orchard Road is expensive - from the clothes to the restaurants. Much better deals elsewhere in the city. There are two MRT (train) stations within a 5-10 minute walk of the hotel with access to multiple MRT train lines which was also nice (Dohby Ghaut and Somerset). You can get to almost any place in Singapore within a 30-minute taxi or train ride that you would want to see, including the zoo, Sentosa Island, the airport, Little India, China Town, Arab Street, etc. The MRT train is very easy to use and very cheap - don't be afraid to try it. There are maps everywhere that allow you to easily figure out where you need to go. Also, don't be afraid to ask the MRT employees how the system works, how to buy a MRT card, etc. Taxis are also relatively inexpensive here and can be easily acquired at the lobby.Hotel - Very nicely finished. The lobby has a nice bar area with live music most nights. The pool on the roof of the 8th floor is also very nice. Drinks are pretty pricey however (I think I paid $18/beer!). Elevators are very quick - there is usually an elevator waiting on the 1st floor with the doors open for you.Room - Average room in my opinion. A bit on the smaller side. Three small drawers in the closet and two medium sized drawers in the room. For a four week stay I ended up piling a bunch of clothes out on the dresser. My wife came and visited for two weeks which complicated things even more. There is a small desk, a refrigerator which is packed with overcharged drinks and another entire cabinet with coffee/tea and other snacks. Two small nightstands, an OK bed and what looks to be a 32\ LCD TV make up the remainder of the room. Also, there is a small chair with foot-rest and a small table. The closet does have a safe - the battery died in ours and we ended up waiting a while for someone to come and open it for us. There is also a ironing board and iron which worked very well. Something in the room I wasn't used to was the fact that you had to insert your room key into a card holder near the door in order to activate electricity and AC in the room. So when you leave you have to take your card with you. Needless to say this is a bit of an inconvenience and I did forget to grab the card a few times when leaving. Also - if you're coming from the US make sure you ask for a power converter as there are no outlets which are 120V. The converter they provided to me was a bit shady looking but did function OK throughout my visit. Bathroom - Pretty nice bathroom. One sink with a large mirror and a smaller magnified mirror on the wall. There is a tub/shower combo which doesn't have a shower curtain. Instead there is a piece of glass which covers half of the shower. Usually during showers a lot of water would spill out onto the floor creating large puddles and a slipping hazard if you're not careful. The shower had two shower heads you could activate and usually plenty of hot water as long as you weren't using it at premium times (early morning). The toilet functioned OK - there are two buttons to press (I'll let you figure out the difference between the two). One odd thing was that there were no outlets in the bathroom to use. There is some weird plug in there to use just for electric shavers (is even says this on the outlet \""Shavers Only\"") however my US purchased electric shaver used a 120V two-prong outlet and didn't work in there. Not a big problem for me (I just charged mine in the room), but my wife was forced to blow dry and straighten her hair in the bedroom because of this.Service - I requested a view of the park across the street and also an upgrade to the executive package. I assumed since I would be staying for so long that I would be given both of these requests, however when I arrived I was disappointed to find out I received neither. I even followed up the next day and was told that no rooms facing the park were available and that the executive upgrade was only given to platinum members of the hotel (however I could pay something like $50-60/day to upgrade if I wished - no thanks!). If you figure out what this hotel costs a day and multiply it times four weeks it comes out to quite a bit of money. I honestly was expecting more from the hotel for this price and very disappointed I did not receive an upgrade. I am a member of the Holiday Inn frequent guest account but obviously did not accumulate enough points for the upgrade. The employees I talked to in the lobby about this didn't seem to concerned about me and were not very accommodating (almost rude at some points). The gentlemen who services the rooms on the 7th floor was very good. When I requested, the room would be made up and taken care of very nicely and he even went out of his way many times when seeing me in the hallway to ask if I needed any extra towels, bottled water, etc. I celebrated my 30th birthday while here and had a lovely cake, fruit platter and bottle of wine delivered to the room to celebrate - an unexpected surprise. While here, I also received a free dinner voucher and free city tour offer. I am planning on using the dinner voucher on my last night here. Service in the lobby was average. When I checked in I specifically asked about phone calls and (after some discussion with other employees) was told that the charge is $0.03 per minute (a fair price in my opinion). However when I inquired about my check-out cost today was told that the charge was in fact $0.30 per minute! I argued a bit with them and got them to reduce the phone bill by 50%. I used calling cards to call back to the US and $0.30/minute is a bit extreme in my opinion. Even so, a hefty bill for phone usage. The only other thing I would like to point out is that on my first or second day here, I was approached by three employees about a cockroach problem in my room. I told them that I hadn't seen any bugs and that the room was recently cleaned and maybe they saw something. They opened up a closet near my room (in the exterior hall) and told me that it had a \""strong smell of cockroaches\"" and that they would need to come in and spray. I obliged and they did go into the room for a few minutes to spray the place down. Did not see any bugs in the room throughout my stay with the exception of a few small ants here and there (just killed a few as I am typing this). Upgrades - As I mentioned - did not receive any upgrades throughout my four-week stay except on my birthday and also a free voucher to their restaurant and for a city tour.Conclusion - If I was coming back here again, I would look for other hotels that offer more for your money. There are quite a few \""off brand\"" hotels near Orchard Road that seem to offer more for your money. You might end up with an extra minute or two talk to Orchard Road but it's worth the savings in the long run.""",695
HolidayInn,2,"“Great position and room, disapppointing staff”","Booked this hotel as our based in Singapore while we were travelling around the city and island. Stayed 3 nights in total for the week, travelling with parents and an infant, I was looking for a hotel with double double bedding to fit us. My experience started from our mid night arrival to hotel, pick up transfer was great, even with a long flight delay which made us arriving at 4am. Overnight front office staff was not welcoming, did not even update us on breakfast location, what was included in the room package (i booked under promotional rate with breakfast, internet and late checkout), until I asked. Rooms were up to our expectation and fit our requirement. Comfortable bedding, only that there wasnt enough blanket and seems little cold at night. On the next morning after breakfast, I approached the concierge counter trying to confirm my transfer to the ferry terminal (had made a few emails to confirm total 4 transfer arrangement prior to my trip). To my surprised, the concierge staff was very rude and ask me if I was the guest arrived 4am last night. After i said yes, he started to blamed us on our flight delay, said we should called the hotel and advise our flight status, his staff were almost cancelled my transfer and luckily they were very \SMART\"" to check with airline while waiting in airport. I then replied that I did sent an email to update our flight delayed, he immediately said \""I can't check email here all the time, you should call!\"". Following with the conversation, I started to get angry, asked him if he had arranged the rest of the transfer for me, he said, no, did not arrange it in advance, you tell me what you need now, I will arrange it for you. OK, since I was with my family, I decided not to argue, only to have him arrange one limo for us immediately. With no price quotation given, he arrange a car for us and charge the rate to the room. The story did not just end here as I thought it would. After spending 3 nights in batam island, we then took the ferry to return to the hotel for a 2 nights stop over before heading home. While we were in batam, I was asking my husband if we should call the hotel to arrange the transfer since the concierge staff said they did not arrange for us in advance even we gave them our arrival ferry time. At first, my husband said we just take two taxi to make things easier. But when we reach the arrival hall before custom, we found a long queue waiting for taxi. Thus, I again called hotel and try to have them arrange one for us in a hour time (there were long queue for custom and baggage clearance anyway). Funny enough, the concierge staff recognize us again and said I ask you to call us and arrange one day prior to your arrival, not when you reach singapore. Oh god, I really had enough of it. I rudely said, just tell me if you can arrange or not, thats it. Then he replied \""yea.. in 30 mins then, you call back in 15 mins to confirm!\"". God, please.. this is really a joke, I was using roaming to call and it cost me S$8 per min to arrange a transfer and reconfirm again?!! The rest of my stay was fair, this round front desk staff in the afternoon shift was accommodating, she tried her best to arrange room next to each other without being asked. Explained my package and pro-actively asked my departure arrangement, ask us if we need transfer to airport (since we will be departing 4am). Restaurant breakfast was great, staff there again, not welcoming and service not up to standard. I asked on baby chair and plates, the lady said whatever is there is there. OK, means get it yourself if you see it exists. Thank you for the great service Holiday Inn, I promise I will never return to your hotel! A great property without service. Disappointed stay!""",314
HolidayInn,3,"“Nice Hotel, Good Staff, Too Bad About the Room”","Checking into this Holiday Inn was a breeze - the front desk staff was friendly and efficient. Bags quickly followed. The location is pretty good, about a block from Orchard Road behind two shopping malls that have seen better days, but also close to several tourist-oriented restaurants and bars. There is a taxi stand in front of the hotel and it is about a 2-3 block walk from the Somerset MRT subway station. The room -- ours was with two double beds (for two adults and two young children) -- was smallish but nicely fitted out. But oh my, a very heavy, overwhelming musty smell! Why they use fabric wallpaper and dark wood in these tropical hotel rooms is beyond me -- attracts mold and mildew like the plague. One could see the tell-tale signs on some of the wood in the closest, next to bed, etc. I should have asked for a new room, but we were tired. Now the pluses. The shower was probably the best we've ever seen in a hotel -- it was fantastic. Our room overlooked an expressway, but you would never know it - the double glazing kept out sounds. There is a pool on the roof, nice size. Regular guests take the breakfast buffet in the 2nd floor restaurant. It was ok, both Western and Asian choices. Service could have been zippier. Those who stay on the 3rd floor executive club floor have a separate breakfast buffet - not as many choices, but calmer. Those who want to have a working breakfast and more attentive service may want to choose that. While I was disappointed in the musty smell in the room -- and that costs the hotel a demerit of one star out of the four I would otherwise have awarded -- this is a reasonable choice, good value in a city that is becoming overpriced.",40

HolidayInn,3,“Centrally located property”,"I am rating this hotel average and not very good because of the overall condition of the room, the lack of view from our room and the fact that despite a room rate of over $ 300.0 the hotel does not provide free Internet. Come on, this is the capital of advanced telecommunication. The lobby is huge, elevators worked well. We supposedly got upgraded to a corner room, sort of a mini suite. The bathroom was a bit in disarray. Tiles were cracked, grout was missing, the toilet seat was not secured tightly and moved around, little things that create big disappointments. We had absolutely no view other than a busy street and the look towards other buildings. As members of the loyalty program we did receive a coupon for a free welcome drink at the lobby bar. With that came the opportunity to access the Internet for free there, which was very appreciated. Taxis were very hard to get at the hotel and we had to wait about 20 minutes to catch a ride. Our room came with breakfast which was served buffet style. There were plenty of choices, the quality was average. The hotel is just a few minutes walk away from Orchard Street where everything happens. The staff at the hotel was very helpful. We felt the that the hotel is overpriced for what it is supposed to be. But then in Singapore many things are overpriced.",544
HolidayInn,3,"“Good hotel, poor services”","I stayed last week at this hotel, as part of a small tour in Asia. We stayed for 5 nights and payed with points. The rack rate was ~270 SGD, which now I find ridiculously expensive for this hotel. It is very close to Orchard road, very good area if you want to shop and be close to MRT. To get to the main road you need to pass through some shady-looking alleys, but everything is safe.In terms of facilities, the best feature of the hotel is the pool area on the roof. Huge pool with variable depth up to 2.4m, large pool for toddlers, large jacuzzi, lounge chairs and a wide shaded area - all add-up to a nice experience in open air.We found the rooms to be on the small side, but equipped with most modern facilities, enough for few days.This is pretty much where the positives stop for me, as almost everyday our view of the hotel took a hit:- at check-in, we were told that they have no executive rooms or suites available; this is fine, I did not expect red carpet treatment. 5 minutes later, I see on the elevator map that they have 2 floors with Executive Rooms and an Executive Lounge. Same size, I assume some better amenities. Front office staff should know better than trying to deceive customers. Hotel was not even half full.- breakfast is fine, but resembles in every aspect with most 3* family hotels in Europe. Good food, but nothing really great about it. I definitely expected more, having experienced some other Holiday Inns in Europe and Asia.- as Platinum member I asked if I could get access to the Executive Lounge. I was denied and advised that no hotel in the chain offers that, that it is only for paying guests. After presenting him with 3 examples of the contrary, the message turned to \local decision of the hotel management\"". Discussion closed :(- one evening we went to the bar to get few drinks. After waiting for more than 15 minutes to have our order taken, another 10 minutes for the drinks to come, we were given the \""privilege\"" the poorest quality cocktails ever, where they poured the least possible amount of alcohol in them. I understand that Singapore is a country where alcohol is over-taxed, but I would expect better service from a 4 star hotel. It took them another 15 minutes to fix the issue. Even then, they just poured additional rum and vodka in the glasses, they did not make a new one :(- One building nearby the hotel is undergoing complete renovation. Not sure about labor standards in Singapore, but the demolition squad was active all night long, making sleep very difficult due to the noise. With alternative being a room facing the highway, we decided not to move, but could not notice the low insulation of the walls and windows. Front desk staff advised it is out of their control, nothing the hotel can do. Advance notification would have been nice though...Overall the hotel has everything it needs to be great, but needs to work significantly on the service and staff. Next time we will likely stay elsewhere, there are hotels out there providing much better service.""",297
HolidayInn,3,“Clayton's upgrade”,"The rave reviews for this place are pretty accurate but my average score I'd due to disappointing service or policy , I'm not quite sure?The rooms and ammenities are great.The concierge and door staff were outstanding and very very helpful! The location and supply of cheap taxis good (seemingly the only cheap thing in singapore)The wait staff in the bar and the breakfast restaraunt were also good natured and helpful. The chefs need to learn our to cook and keep eggs hot .Our biggest concern and disappointment was the room we were given. The lady on front desk was pleasant and greeted us warmly and noted we are priority club members. We were then allocated a room on one of the two executive floors, which we assumed was an upgrade. Why else put us there unless the hotel was full, which I doubt and if so why not mention as much. I knew free wifi was included but upon ringing reception I was told yes then oh no actually.We asked again later about this and the lounge and were told no, not for you. We ga e three chances to rectify what I reckon was a bit ordinary way to handle it , to no avail. The mini bar was not filled but on our last day I was asked why it wasn't filled and then told but it was your request , I said I was never asked and by the way this whole deal was a bit raw.I asked about it upon check out and was basically blown off, the third or fourth chance to have management at least apologies. Nothing!! Airlines do not upgrade you to a better seat and then treat you like second class, nor should hotels. Ps it was room 431",67
HolidayInn,2,“Ideal Location”,A good hotel idealy situated for access to the main shopping areas and the MRT system. The Executive Lounge is characterless but the staff are very friendly and helpful. The Lounge offers a good selection of snacks and drinks in the evening. It offers a good and fresh breakfast.The Window on the Park restaurant offers a buffet dinner but also an a la carte which is average.,413
HolidayInn,3,“Good Budget Option”,"This hotel was recommended by a few friends who had stayed at this property earlier.The front desk staff who met us early in the morning was very nice person with a good attitude and very helpful nature, as we all always request for an early check in but are always welcomed with the same reason that rooms haven't been vacated and are accommodated with rooms close to check in time itself, but for a surprise here we dint have to wait we were checked in to both our rooms within half an hour.The rooms were very neat and clean and very welcoming, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. We chose the junior suites to stay in.So after a long flight and after a good hours nap it was time to hit the breakfast. The breakfast was very ordinary, firstly the Veg options are very very limited to 1 dish per day, also the place where breakfast is served is very small so gets really noisy and cramped up. One doesn't want to start the day with a noisy breakfast and pushing and shoving for getting yourself from the buffet. The only good part was the freshly squeezed juice that was being made and also the breakfast for young children.Also the housekeeping is very very bad, the linen etc is don't up pretty fine but they don't change the used crockery and cutlery, used cups were just left behind the way we left them, the fork and knife used was just kept back in the plate that was eaten in and left in one corner.Part of the room package had a fruit platter everyday, but when we were there we got only one fruit platter and nothing was replaced, also while the beds were done for the night, on the first day they kept chocolates near the bedside but on subsequent days it wasn't done in one room while it was done in the other room we had taken.The location of the hotel is just a stone throw away from Orchard Street, the main shopping road in Singapore.So one can keep going around the place and when tired drop by and relax for sometime and again hit back, also there is a good set of eatery's just behind the hotel with all kinds of cuisines available.Overall this hotel is an averagely nice and comfortable stay.will recommend if you are looking for a budget place close to the heart of the city.",65

The negative side for this hotel is only there a charge for using WIFI.",147
HolidayInn,3,“Old Favourite Struggling to Keep Up”,"I've stayed at this Holiday Inn many times over the past twenty years due to its great location and value and experienced its many iterations and continual renovations. However, my patience was stretched to the limit during my last stay when despite prepayment and notification of a late check-in my reserved double room had been sold off a few hours hours before I arrived. l was left with a choice of the disabled room, numerous foul smelling 'smoking' rooms or a recently decorated (that very day!) paint fume ridden room. It's very hard to stay loyal and the loyalty membership now seems so redundant! Despite this painful late night mix up the management tried very hard to make amends the next day by showering me with complimentary fresh flowers, fruit, chocolates, cake and wine but I think I'll try one of my other Singapore favourites next time.",1126
HolidayInn,3,"“Super Location and Nice Hotel, friendly Staff, Badly Managed.”","My family and I had a business related trip in Singapore for 3 days and after reading many reviews online and being familiar with the different hotel chains as we live in Bali and operate an Australian service business ourselves, we decided to give the lower end of the Intercontinental group chain a go.I would like to make others aware that we are frequent travelers and on this occasion we confirmed with the hotel that they would be able to meet our expectations of traveling with 4 ( yes 4 children under 5 years old and our maid ) We have twin girls 2 yrs and a 5 and 3 year old boys and we booked 2 club rooms for 2 nights.Upon check in we were informed that only one of our interconnecting rooms were available and that we would have to wait until the guests with a late checkout to vacate before we could take possession, this being petty was a major nuisance to us after being on a flight with 2 infants and having to move into 1 room with 7 people. ( it was confirmed by the hotel that their would be no problem)Also the extra bed that we organized online and confirmed by phone while we were in Bali was not ready and they then tried to charge us for this, although to their credit they helped us here.So check in was not so smooth even though we had gone to great lengths before leaving Bali to qualify the property well to accommodate our needs. The team obviously doesn't communicate very well and this needs attention.As we booked 2 club rooms we were able to either dine in the executive lounge for breakfeast or the restaurant on the 3 rd floor , we opted for the buffeton the third floor. The breakfeast is by far and away the best part of this hotel with their being a fantastic selection of quality food from perfect scrambled eggs to smoked salmon, fresh juices pastries and coffee and the service was superb in every way!I personally commended the restaurant manager ( who I didn't know was the manager atthetime ) and thanked him for looking after my 5 year old son while choosing at the buffet selection, I had to stay and mind the table after losing one to another guest as there was only two of us in the restaurant at the time. I later found out that this restaurant manager had been at the helm for over 15 years and the breakfeast buffet ran like a well oiled machine, every single guest being welcomed into the restaurant, seated and even the senior staff helping to get coffees etc.After prganising high end Weddings and Events in Bali Indonesia and having over 22 years of experience in this industry it was clear to see they were professionals, fantastic job and well done it could have been the Intercontinental.On the down side and I don't like being negative but I think these need to pointed out online as we did at the time, Club rooms are more expensive and have benefited attached , the rooms were nicely appointed and they were quite good size which is what I look at, they gave us two rooms though with no views whatsoever except for concrete across the road, on the other side of the sixth floor would have been nice if there was availability.The porter who helped us check in and all the bag staff were fantastic and we tipped them well, although when you called called guest services to bring you a bucket of ice or help you back into your connecting room because the kids locked the door, we had to call at least 4 times before someone was sent to the room.......this was a very poor effort and if I wasn't paying so much a night for a club room , or was in a 2 star hotel I wouldn't have cared. Many of the housekeeping staff couldn't Speke English also.One of the nicest things as every traveller knows that always upgrades their rooms to a club executive whatever you want to call it is the ability to relax and usually have drinks and canapés every evening before dinner etc and these lounges are usually very good value.The first evening we just didn't even have time to enjoy this facility's we were busy with business however the next evening we decided to have a hour relaxing with a few drinks and some food. Upon entering the lounge it is very nicely presented although there are many guests outside trying to work out how to enter the lounge as it isn't very clear, and the staff member who was supposed to be on the desk at the entry to let guests in was often not there.The food canapés and general areas were really nice however the service in this lounge was so bad I literally had to sit with the bartender to make my drinks after waiting half an hour with my wife for them, they previously came out twice and were wring every time.....I could not believe this and it was totally evident that the hotel's management placed all their trainees in this lounge to serve the higher end clientelle......What the??? When I ordered a second glass of Savingnon Blanc from the waitress she didn't even know the difference between a red wine and a white......she thought it was a red. This in my opinion is just totally an acceptable having to deal with such untrained staff that had no knowledge of drinks, wines, mixing drinks and service......one lady brought my wife a glass of wine with her fist wrapped around the stem of the glass and a can of Tiger beer under her arm for myself, no coasters given out on tables unless asked for.After speaking with the duty manager , after waiting more than half an hour for our drinks she was highly embarrassed and apologetic for the pathetic service, she agreed with us that the hotel finds it very hard keeping staff and yes true to our assumptions the Club lounge was where the management placed all there trainees, this was so evident to someone in any type of service business.In conclusion I would like to say that this hotel is a fine hotel with a great location. As stated the breakfeast was the best part. Attention to detail was severely lacking and the service in the Club lounge and level was pathetic, I am hoping that management has a good read of this review and starts rectifying things. We were given a 6 pm late checkout , a $50 Taxi fare to the airport and generally many apologies for the service.",107
HolidayInn,3,“Lacks complete attention to detail. Everything is with a sorry!”,"This is an old hotel that has undergone many changes and adaptations. Booked here because of the sheer IHG loyalty factor. The property does not have a GM currently and that shows in every sphere - lack of direction.I arrived at the hotel at 3 PM with a confirmed reservation - the room was not ready. They charged my debit card for a pre-authrization till i explained what a debit card was.The next morning there was a lethal metal piece that was in the cereal. After reporting all this, the apologies seemed to flow in bagfuls. Why cannot hotels deliver the most basic service that is required?",85
HolidayInn,1,“Priority Club Members beware”,"The stay was nowhere near the value of what was being charged. The hotel charges downtown rates while being nowhere near the downtown core. Will never stay at this hotel again. Stayed at this hotel for a week and a half, spent over $4000 and ended up with no points, same thing had happened to a coworker on a separate trip a few months earlier. Claimed discounted rate, which was higher than standard room rates. Terrible experience. Will not be back. Avoid at all costs.",18

HolidayInn,3,“Met expectations”,"Good location (just behind Centrepoint, Orchard Road). Close proximity to shopping centres, pubs, restaurants, MRT, banks,etc. Comfortable room/bed and nice bathroom amenities. Friendly cafe staff (breakfast) but front office staff can do better (Not so friendly and too mechanical. They seem to just want to quickly check you in and check you out like a factory line). A nice hotel to stay with minimum of fuss unless you want more attention, then head for the Raffles.....",263
HolidayInn,3,“Not bad”,"Its probably because we visited Singapore right after visiting Bali that we could feel the coldness in the hospitality of Singapore. The Holiday Inn premier room we chose for our stay was about 10 times smaller than the private Villa we were staying at Bali and we felt really good about our stuffed daily itinerary in Singapore as we would not have to spend too much time in our small room. Although I understand it is not fair to compare a hotel room to a Villa, I simply couldn't resist it. I certainly wouldn't say Holiday Inn was value for money as we were paying almost same as we paid for our Villa in Bali.However the two plus points of the hotel are the location of hotel and availability of Indian food at the Tandoor restaurant in the hotel. The hotel is located just a block away from the main Orchard street which was beautifully decorated for Christmas and has all the malls lined up there. We spent our first evening on the Orchard street shopping through the all decorated malls instead of sitting in the room. All the other things at hotel just follow the 'Holiday Inn' standards. No place to complaint really. Room service was good. Food at restaurant was 'not bad' (not great either).To conclude Holiday Inn is a safe bait as compared to other hotels in Singapore. The location is a plus. However nothing exceptionally good either. Certainly not an ideal place for honeymooners or couples looking for a cozy and relaxing stay. Try Bali for that purpose... ;-)",198
HolidayInn,3,“Good location and friendly staff”,"I stayed with my family at the Holiday Inn Orchard City Center in early Nov 2011. I had completed the booking a few weeks in advance and was confirmed in a room with double beds. On checking in, I was informed that they had only a room with a king size bed available and that they would throw in an extra bed in the room without any extra charge. They also treated us to a dinner at the Indian restaurant onsite which was a nice gesture (great food by the way, if you happen to stay at the Holiday Inn, make sure you eat there). I found the room to be quite small and less impressive than the photo that the reservation staff had shared with me earlier when I made my booking. The carpet in the room was very damp and smelly because the A/C was dripping. We informed the maintenance team and they fixed the problem but the humidity in the room did not fully go away during our stay. That said and on the whole, it was an OK experience and I would consider staying there again given the good service offered by the staff.",252
HolidayInn,3,“Service definately needs improvement”,"I'll start with the positive things about this hotel - its in a great location, very close to Orchard Road, the rooms are nice aside from the somewhat terrible backwash toilet smell and the reception area is lovely, the breakfast is great with a good selection.... however its let down by what I can only describe as inconsistent levels of customer service. The breakfast staff were great - all very friendly and helpful but don't think for one moment that it extends to the all other staff. The majority of which either forget to come back to you, have no idea at all and give different information whenever you call or don't really seem to care. We had a complete debacle with the internet. When we first arrived we were told it wasn't included in the room rate, then we were told it was included in a $48 ++ per day rate and then after all this (3 days later) we discover its actually free. My advice is - don't book this place at the pretty expensive rate it is without getting the complimentary wi fi. We have stayed all over the world and I was shocked that a hotel like this in the IT capital of the world charges $1 a minute for the internet in the business centre! I mean come on. While this hotel is nice, there were some major drawbacks that the hotel needs to be sorted out - the first of which should be customer service training!",87

HolidayInn,3,“Nice enough - but service is based on quantity not quality”,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and while the location is very good and the rooms are comfortable, the service falls well short. There appears to be staff everywhere, but I would rather see less of them in exchange for a few staff capable of delivering quality service. The executive club staff are a case in point, where staff are almost overbearing in numbers, but few really look closely to determine what guests require. The staff are all very friendly (sometimes too friendly) but not very observant. As an example, 4 staff standing next to empty food/drink containers shows a lack of training and proper management oversight. Sleep was very difficult because of the volume of the \Muzak\"" playing in the corridors. It made the overall experience very unpleasant.As a premium member of the chain's loyalty program, I was very dissapointed with the service from check-in to check out. I will probably not stay there again.""",39

Not sure if my room got upgraded or not either. I asked for a non-smoking room but got a smoking junior suite, which wasn't really a suite, but more like a bigger version of a normal room. The room size is decent. Room is quiet. Everything is clean. Breakfast buffet was okay. Staff at the restaurant were friendly.I switched to the Traders the next two nights and got a room almost the same price. The Traders has smaller rooms and location not as great as this Holiday Inn, but the overall experience was much better.",95
HolidayInn,3,“Nice Hotel in Good Location”,This is a nice hotel right next to Orchard Rd. It is what you would expect from Holiday Inn. My only issue is for the business traveler the internet charges are a ripp-off. I use the internet quiet a bit as I need to keep my business running when traveling. At almost $30 per day or just a hour per day is just not on when many good hotels provide it free.

HolidayInn,1,“Disappointed!!!”,"I booked the hotel due to its location near Orchard Road. Everything seemed to be fine up till the day of check out. When I checked out, I realised that the hotel has included an extra charge of about SGD 300-400 (which was inconsistent with my booking confirmation). The hotel staff failed to explain why and said that it was a mistake on their end. I had to wait for nearly an hour for the hotel staff to sort out the bill as a result. However, when I received my credit card bill today, I realised that an extra SGD 371.93 has been charged to my card. I am trying to write to the hotel to ask for refund now. I am truly disappointed with the services provided by the hotel!! Despite the time I wasted waiting for them to fix the bill/invoice, they still didn't manage to solve the problems.

HolidayInn,3,“The Typical Holiday Inn Experience”,"Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights, got their special weekend rate on the hotel's site for an executive room with 2 double beds. I have stayed in other Holiday Inn hotels, and must say that overall it was the typical Holiday Inn experience. Nothing really great to make noise about, and nothing that bad to merit a negative feedback. Executive lounge was appropriately equipped with coffee machine, wine chiller, and wifi. Breakfast was ho-hum as it had the usual everyday of eggs, bacon, sausages, breads. Cocktails was served 6-8pm everyday which included wine and some sushi. Room had musty beddings which surprised me because we stayed in a fairly newly renovated room. But it was solved as I had the beddings changed. Our package included 2 pcs laundry everyday and it was promptly given back before 6pm. Location was just a corner away from Orchard Rd which gave it a plus in my opinion.The only glitch I had about this whole experience was about booking. I had booked a few weeks prior to our arrival on their special weekend rate and was disappointed to see a slightly lower rate for the same room a week before our arrival. I called the hotline which then gave me the number directly to the hotel in Singapore so that I may have the rate adjusted. I called them and they said that since I booked it on that rate I couldn't have it adjusted. This kind of irritated me as I am a priority club member and thought they should have been more accommodating on this as other hotel chains who have lowest booking guarantee on their sites usually honor a cheaper rate when it turns up. I would stay in this hotel again if I find a good rate. I would not however give it such an excitedly awesome review as others have. For me it was standard for the price.",318
HolidayInn,3,“Location - good for Orchard Road but noise from bars/nightclubs”,"We stayed in this hotel because it offered a family room (2 double beds). We stayed on a smoking floor because it would have cost more to have a non-smoking room (can't work out why it would be more expensive). There was a smell of stale smoke but we did get used to the smell. The room was a typical hotel room - nothing special and nothing terrible. I loved the shower and bath but it was difficult to get into due to the high and wide barrier. The shower head was great - strong spray that you could adjust as required. The staff were friendly. The pool was medium sized and set up nicely with shaded seats and sunlounges. The spa pool was out of order when we were there. I had to use the Business Centre internet twice. It was explained to me that the costs were 50 cents per minute so I tried to keep my use right down. It was not explained to me how to actually 'stop the clock' (end the session) - so both times I was caught out paying extra. They charge for part minutes as well - so I paid for a full minute while trying to work out how to stop the clock - I had gone 7 seconds over (the first time the staff member stopped the clock when I went looking for them). Anyway my recommendation is to go out and find an internet cafe - don't bother with the Business Lounge at all. The location for shopping and food on Orchard Road is excellent .... the only problem is we were kept awake at night by the nightclubs at the back of the hotel. Also, there are a few sex shops in the vicinity - not so great for families. However, these can be avoided by going through the plaza at the back of the hotel.",216
HolidayInn,3,“Extra charge by the IHG hotels”,"We recently stayed at this hotel as we have done many times before, but this time we were charged and extra $30.00 a night for the second person. I have never heard of this before. Apparently this is now the common practice in Asia and internationally, that this hotel chain will charge the extra $30.00. I cannot understand why, we booked a room for 2 people which included breakfast for 2 people. I have the confirmation saying that it is for 2 people, yet they are now saying that more than one person in a room is an extra charge. When you have 2 people in a room you pay an extra $30.00. I am really confused that they can advertise a price for 2 people and then slug you another $30.00 a night. I am not sure if I will re book this hotel again. We all should write to these hotels and complain, as I cannot understand how they can justify this charge. Please everyone we need to complain and be heard. Now that this hotel chain has started this charge all the others will follow. Our holidays will end up costing more and it is hard enough now to try and have a holiday without the hotels adding extra charges to our bill.",173

Everyone who works in this hotel is fabulous and the location is superb. We had a room on the seventh floor which was comfortable and clean. Our room was at the rear of the building away from a very busy main road so we thought ourselves to be lucky. Quite to the contrary. There is a strip of bars and dining venues that extend one block from the side and rear of the hotel down to Orchard road. Its popular with younger people and the dance music kicks off at about 10.30pm and continued, without stop, through to 4.00am. We stayed at the hotel on a Saturday, Sunday and Monday night and this happened each night. Im usually a very deep sleeper but the continual thud of the music drove all of us insane.

I asked for another room that would be quieter, and they gave us a room on the 3rd floor, on the \quieter\"" side of the hotel. However, the other side also faces a road, and there was an open air restaurant (open late) about 70 meters from our room. In addition, a large group of men seemed to congregate nightly on the street just outside our room, talking loudly until nearly midnight. All of this, in addition to the screaming drunk guys in the room next to us, playing cards/shouting until 3 in the morning ------ well, it did not make the best impression.Other problems?1. The hot tub did not look like it had been cleaned in ages, with little brown bits floating everywhere.2. The pool for children is extremely slippery and very unsafe if children are not very carefully monitored. My daughter (4 years old) lost her balance and could not regain it, because she kept slipping, but luckily I was right there to help her.On the positive side, as others have mentioned, the staff are fine, and the rooms are fine. The breakfast if fine as well, though they close things down precisely at the end of breakfast, in a kind of frenzy. So, overall, a very, very average experience. Granted, the noise issues are a result of a poor location. But, there were a number of others small things that added up over three days, contributing to the overall \""average\"" experience. But, then again, this is the Holiday Inn, so I suppose I should not have gotten my hopes up.""",34

IBIS_BEN,3,“Does what it says on the tin”,"While well located, this hotel is not particularly anything. It's fast, cheap(ish) and entirely inoffensive. The bed was comfortable, the hot water strong (though the bathroom was quite out of date) and the towels somewhere between fluffy and sandpaper. Staff were efficient without being intrusive or abrupt. No surprises, no delights. Simple, efficient, clean.",246
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Cheap, clean, but something was missing”","Ibis presented what I thought was a good cheap mid range option in Singapore in a central location. There were complications with extending my stay one night, apparently I had to rebook back on the Ibis website to extend at the same rate and re-check in the next day. Then I booked a double bed and ended up with a twin, and despite asking they said they were running short of doubles and could not swap rooms. The bed was very uncomfortable (I made the mistake of taking the advice of a previous reviewer that the beds here were comfortable - should have known better for a budget hotel, my fault entirely). The food options near the hotel are very good as you are right in the middle of Bugis and chinatown. This is good, because the food available at the hotel is very average and quite expensive considering what's nearby. Also, they promote food at the restaurant or in your room 24/7 (no room service by the way), but actually there is no breakfast available except buffet in the restaurant and only if you have it included. Check in and check out was same as any hotel. So it did what it said it would - a clean room no frills. I personally want a bit more from my hotel, so this will inspire me to spend a little more next time. But if cheap is what you want, then this is a fine option.",133
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Central, reasonable hotel”","Overall, a good experience - comfortable and clean room, decent breakfast etc (although the fridge is so small I couldn't even get a bottle of water in it! Definitely worth the price but when I went to book a second stay for a visit three weeks later (using the same sites I'd used before to book), the price had gone up by over 50% - this makes it hard to recommend the hotel. At the first price, it probably warrants 4 stars but at the second price… well, there are many comparable hotels better located for cheaper rates.The staff were less knowledgeable than I would expect for a hotel of this sort and the location, while good, is a bit awkward to get to with public transit. Fortunately, taxis are cheap and reliable.",151
IBIS_BEN,1,“Bad...really bad experience here!”,"I booked online and reached at 1pm there. Being a gold card member, I could have early check-in. They made me wait for 1.5 hrs saying room cleaning is going on. I wonder anyone cleans the room (such a small room!) for 1.5 hrs. And every 15mins I had to go to the reception and remind them that Iam still waiting. Then they start searching my details everytime and I got the same reply...\sorry sir, room is being cleaned. I will push the housekeeping\""....never seen such hospitality (!!!!) in any Asian hotels...atleast not in any accor hotels this side. They gave me a smoking room with no matches/lighter. Poor selection of breakfast. Nothing like Singapore special there! Had to queue up for taxi everytime. Receptionist gave me totally a wrong direction to Mustafa centre. She must have been confused with \""left\"" and \""right\"".....anyway, this will be my last in Ibis, Bencoolen!""",211
IBIS_BEN,1,“would not stay here again”,Having stayed at this hotel before I found it to be reasonable so I thought I would try it again.The second time was not so good.When we first got there we asked for a room on a higher floor of which we were told that we would have to wait about 30 minutes even thought it was past checkin time.Having just traveled 16 hrs on a flight this news was hard to take so I settled for the lower floor.When we got to our rooms the key did not work so after a long process we finally got into the room.After we unpacked we went down to get some ice.We asked the bar tender for some ice so he went away and come back and said what would you like.I said ICE.This happened four times until we finally got some ice.We found that it was hard to sleep due to the hard beds and noisy corridor.On our last day we had organised for a late check out but when we got back we found that we had been locked out of our room and had to go down to reception to sort it out.Clearly these problems do not add to a good holiday.I think next time we will try the Mecure.,59
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good Location”,"The room was satisfactory for my overnight stay in Singapore. A bit on the pricey side (but many things are in Singapore). Location was great with access to all the things I needed during my stay. Room conditions were fine, although I would have preferred if the air conditioning was a bit cooler and the room not as snug.",43
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ibis- always the same”,The rooms are a bit tired and so many on the floor - it can be very noisy sometimes; The selection in the breakfast is rather poor and somehow tasteless;The location – while not amazing- is still good enough to explore the city;,64
IBIS_BEN,3,“Convenient good find”,"For three nights in Singapore, I chose the Ibis for location and price. Room was acceptable, a bit small but clean. Disappointingly, breakfast was not included and I could find no good places nearby. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is walking distance to shopping if you like malls. I have no specific complaints but I would probably upgrade on my next trip.",41
IBIS_BEN,3,“Basic hotel for business travel”,"Small compact rooms just for business travellers. Nothing much to offer in this hotel but I suppose that is what IBIS stands for. It meets your basic needs of a decent bed, clean toilet, good WIFI and just about sufficient bar.",168
IBIS_BEN,3,“Clean hotel in good location”,"I discovered that hotels in Singapore are very expensive. Ibis was one of the cheaper 3 to 4 star hotels that I found. Room was basic and clean. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. I chose a package that included breakfast. There was a good selection of European and Asian foods. Bus stop right out the front of the hotel. At the rear entrance to the hotel is the set down/pick up area with concierge. Taxi's were very convenient from here and compared to Aussie taxi prices, very cheap. There are several shopping malls in easy walking distance and a 711 store located in the same building. The only negative was lack of supplies in the room. Only two sachets of coffee and two sachets of sugar. Only one small soap between two of us. Having said that, when I asked for more supplies they were happily provided. The single beds were very firm, which suited me but I am sure some would find them uncomfortably hard.",66
IBIS_BEN,3,“Not suitable even if you are not claustrophobic”,"The entire room is smaller than my bathroom. Hardly any space to walk around (expected slightly bigger room for the money). Nice decor, good location and good breakfast. Very inefficient check out and even after filling out the membership form, they have not registered me yet (after 8 months). Word of advice: if you are in a hurry, take the stairs because elevators are ridiculously slow.",252
IBIS_BEN,3,“Budget Hotel@Great Location”,"Its an IBIS chain budget hotel, centrally located with good service & efficient staff, though a bit overpriced.1. Location is great. BUGIS MRT is only 5 mnts. walk and many restaurants with local as well International cuisine very nearby. Also, there is one weekly interesting local flee-market/Bazaar very near to it.2. Rooms are clean, but small & compact in size. Kettle, Tea/coffee and safe-unit are provided in the room. Beds are nice clean and with a small TV, small wash-room, its a basic budget room.3. Hotel has many rooms and free fast wi-fi accessible from everywhere. Considering no. of rooms, the no. of lifts are less though.4. Hotel has couple of restaurants, with 24 hr coffee shop. The breakfast spread is decent with Juices, Cereals, Fruits, Bread, Eggs and many Veg. as well many Non-veg. options. So I had a breakfast which was very filling, with many choices available.5. The service is quick, fast and efficient. Both check-in and check-out was a breez. They also have 15 minutes guarantee service which really works. The staff is courteous and helpful, especially will mention about Ms. Kimberly, who made my stay comfortable with prompt service, and always with a smile!6. While its a budget hotel, I found it to be a bit-overpriced and would have given a much higher ratings, if they reduce their price by say 20% down.Overall its a good budget hotel with great location, good service and efficient staff , a bit-overpriced though. Will recommend to stay for a small stay.",57
IBIS_BEN,3,“Value for money”,This hotel is bang in the heart of the city. Very close to famous landmarks of Singapore. Close to the bus & train stations.

There is a free shuttle to Universal Studio opposite of the hotel (Summer View Hotel). The Thai restaurant next to Summer View Hotel serves good food *thumbs up*7-11 is just next door, and few shopping malls just walking distance away.

Staff very nice and good breakfast. Rooms are small (just what you should expect from an Ibis) and clean. Big problem is the Jackhammer ( a big one!!) waking you up at 7am for a non-stop job until 7 or 8pm.... understood it's because of the new subway works.... If you want to relax, forget it. Better if you ask a room not facing the Bencoleen street.",68

IBIS_BEN,3,“No frills compact hotel”,"My husband and I recently stayed here for 5 night. The rooms are very compact so I would not stay for any longer as it is hard to unpack luggage due to minimal cupboard space. The room has a small fridge, kettle with tea & coffee satchets, a bench seat and a desk in front of the window. The bathroom is small with a shampoo dispenser in the shower, and a small hand soap provided for the basin. We did find the bed very hard. Breakfast was included in our deal and it was an all you can eat selection of eastern and western food, so you did not go hungry but it was nothing outstanding. The staff were all very friendly and helpful though I sometimes had a slight communication problem - was told there was all day coffee downstairs but this only went for breakfast. Found the drinks at the bar to be very dear and not that good.There is a 7 Eleven downstairs which is handy for small purchases but for a bigger variety there is a Cold Storage supermarket at Bugis MRT, about 8mins walk, take Exit C which is up an escalator. There is Burger King across from the hotel but further down the mall is a Subway which we found better quality and value.",67
IBIS_BEN,3,“two days in Singapore”,We spent two nights at the Ibis on Bencoolen in January. The room was clean but compact with little storage room. Breakfast was Ok but alcohol was expensive. Location is very good and there id a Hawker centre locally with cheap good food. The hotel lived up to expectation - reception was friendly but had little knowledge of local facilities. The guy who organised taxis was great.,451

The hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. They helped me to switch rooms because I was not happy with my earlier room. And that brings me to the downside; the place looks and feels very run down. The rooms look so old and requires a big overhaul. In fact, the door handle was almost broken by the time I left. The bathrooms are cramped and feels unclean.",107

The breakfast included was quite good although very busy. Location was OK too, we like to walk so although Orchard Road was a bit of a hike we still found it reasonable. Close to the rapid transit which is fantastic. Took it both to and from the airport both ways and have no complaints regarding that. Staff were very efficient and helpful when asked any questions. One annoyance was the elevators were very busy and we spent several minutes waiting for one anytime we left the hotel.",40
IBIS_BEN,3,“Enjoyed our stay”,We found the hotel clean and staff were friendly and helpful. However the view was not the best. A short walking distance to Little India. The room was very spacious and bathroom clean. The room fridge was a rather small.,147

The food was good, however spread was limited specially if you are vegetarian. Check-in and check-out timings are strictly adhered to and you wud get a room early only if u r too lucky. They made us shift rooms and in the process i lost a pair of shoes which i never got back.

Any noise from people in the corridor could be heard and also could hear people in the rooms next door although this wasn't as bad.There was a constant noise every 5 minutes which sounded like a drill which was coming from outside but this was something coming from the hotel building, also the air con unit was extremely noisy even when on the lowest setting.This sounds like a long list of moans, the location was ok if not great but for the price paid the room was fine. I would not stay here again but if on a budget and just for a few nights its not a bad option.Staff were friendly so no complaints there.",166

Those are the same worldwide. The hotel is convenient, clean and in an OK location but at 220 SGD+ per night (130 euros +) it’s certainly no good value for money.After I was there, I did additional research on tripadvisor and found MUCH better room in the same price bracket or slightly higher. (Including Accor own Novotel at Clark Quay which is actually a very nice hotel)Being an A Club Platinum there was of course nothing to expect at ibis as room are all the same.The breakfast selection was rather poor… Overall I would not staying there especially at this price.",52

A five minute walk to the subway (Bugis is closest, also Bras Basah is an easy walk). The subway is the easiest way to get around. Staff were helpful and friendly all the time. They did help me with an early checking (my flight arrived 6am) but had to settle for a twin single room rather than double bed. Is a short taxi ride (SGD 15-20) from the airport (that was in morning and evening peak which was very reasonable compared to Melbourne or LA).I do recommend this hotel for those, like me, who only need a spot to sleep at night and not much more.",219

Food is not cheap at the hotel restaurant is not cheap but then again it is not outrageous; Very Convenient Location.There is a good size convenience store (7/11) and a pharmacy (Guardian) downstairs, together with a few eating places. The hotel is walking distance to the national museum and underground (MRT). There's a bus stop just in front of the hotel.No Gym/Pool:There are no exercise facilities at all and if you want to go for a jog they're a lot of lights to cross...CONCLUSIONS:I would probably stay at Ibis Singapore again but it will be highly highly dependent on the rate.

There are barely any channels on the TV. I kept itching like crazy when I got into the bed, I was so careful when I came home not to bring what ever it was back with me. They have food downstairs to eat which was overpriced for convenience but was also mediocre ; they are not a real restaurant, so consider going up the street. Taxis are always outside waiting to take you somewhere. 7-11 is right next to the hotel, so any last minute forgettable(s) or midnight snacks can easily be retrieved. There is a mall called Bugis which is within walking distance so consider going there. There is a Bugis Market / Shopping Area, its covered and they sell great souvenirs and tons of clothing, iphone cases, watches, shoes, etc. for a great price. There are tons of restaurants around.",303
IBIS_BEN,3,“Fulfill your basic needs”,"Stayed there for three nights and there's nothing really to make my stay pleasant or disappointing. We all know what to expect at these room rates from this city. In between hostels and better hotels, I think it's fair to say that Ibis Bencoolen is a safe bet, an all-rounder.Check-in on a Sunday afternoon was reasonably fast. I expected there would be queues given the sheer number of rooms but there were only one to two persons waiting in each line. The elevators (a total of four) could get congested at times but only at times, and waiting time was acceptable.A lot has been said about their rooms and there is not much more I could add to, though unlike many others I found the softness of the bed just right for me. And the shower stall was truly tiny, but I'm waiting to be told there are tinier elsewhere.The only brightspot I found about the hotel was actually the coins operated laundry machines on the third floor. There was a row of machines in the room and four of them (nearer to the door) were for washing and the other four for drying. It took 4 one-dollar coins to operate either the washing or drying machine, and (at least up the time of my stay) the coins had to be the \older\"" ones which are entirely bronze. The dollar coins in the latest issue which are in bi-metallic composition and slightly larger size wouldn't fit into the slot. So it would take 8 one-dollar coins for washing and drying. Each procedure took 40 minutes. You could just time the process, leave the machine running and return at a later time. For 8 local dollars you could wash and dry a machine of clothes and that's super value in Singapore in my opinion.""",41
IBIS_BEN,3,“Noise from air condition”,"There are too noise in bath room #1106 due to poor air condition. Location is okay for taking the bus, but it is little far away from MTR. The room charge is higher than the rate in Europe (Germany and Netherland). ",128
IBIS_BEN,3,“Convienant location and decent hotel”,The Ibis Bencolen promotes itself as a budget hotel however for a rate of 150 USD a night I can't really agree. Apart from the price not being on the budget side the hotel is very good located. The bugis area has lots of nice malls and restaurants surrounding it. You can walk to Arab street or Little India. I even walked to Orchard rd one afternoon. The rooms are clean and has a little fridge which is cool. The shower was good. The breakfast I had one day for 22 SGD which I did not find it worth it so I only went once. I guess the hotel is a great hotel however for that price you can pay a little bit more and get more luxury.,50
IBIS_BEN,3,“Standard room”,This hotel is in an excellent location. VERY SMALL ROOM! Nothing really to say about it as it is just a place to sleep. Ask about Happy Hour. Food basic as is the menu. Would we stay here again? Depends on length of time and budget. Staff OK and professional.,91
IBIS_BEN,3,“Expensive budget hotel with minimal services and amenities”,"The hotel is well located near Little India, Orchard Road, China Town and CBD (Central Business District). My room was pleasantly spacious (for a solo traveller), almost spick-and-span. I would have given the hotel a better rating if:1. its employees were more friendly and knowledgeable; 2. its bed was more comfortable; 3. its WIFI speed was more consistent; and 4. it did not cancel my WIFI connection before the official check-out time at 12pm. This is a rather pricey budget hotel. Just don't expect hotel amenities like gymnasium or swimming pool.",37
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average budget accommodation”,"Nothing to write home about. Small pokie rooms with hard beds. Ok if you are out and about all the time, but definitely not for families with children. Reaonable location. Long wait for lifts. Would not revisit.",91
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Too much hype; generic, boring, basic hotel”","I've admittedly never stayed in an Ibis before, so my disappointment probably had a lot to do with expectations. This is a generic, boring, basic hotel. There is no gym - and my room was too small to even do jumping jacks in. It feels like staying inside an IKEA store display. Wasn't even particularly clean. Only plus was the fantastic location. And, I suppose it was affordable for Singapore, but I'd never stay here again. Definitely worth paying $20 more to stay somewhere with at least some personality and character.",183
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ibis on Bencoolen is Basic and Reliable”,"The Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is a budget hotel. It is basic, there is nothing to write home about because it is not memorable. There are no amazing features but there are also no horrible failings. You get what you pay for: a clean bed in a clean room and nothing much else--it's straightforward, no surprises, a fine but not spectacular breakfast, an okay (not highly problematic but also not fast) internet connection, and a slow but friendly service. The rooms are tiny and hallway noise is ever present. Amenities are few and generic. The upside: this is a reliable hotel in a great location next to shopping and restaurants. For vegetarians: the Fortune Center next door offers an array of vegetarian restaurants from Chinese to Japanese and Indian. These are not upscale restaurants, more like mom and pop family restaurants and stalls--but very enjoyable and delicious. Would I stay at this Ibis again? No, but only because I'd want a bit more comfort. Otherwise, I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for those who like the price and have realistic expectations.",54
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ok for price”,"Location was great, didn't have a do not disturb sign when we requested one they said they didn't have one. Room was a lot smaller than we were expecting.

The location is in Bugis and central that way, but it feels like a (new) hostel. Just kind of cheap and mnimal. Robotic checkin didn't help my first impression either.

IBIS_BEN,3,“Decent for personal stay but not for business trips”,"The hotel is a decent choice for personal stay. Service is OK, staff is OK. But mind that if you are on a business trip, don't go for Ibis. You have better options available there. Rooms are pretty small in area and also the rest rooms. And note that its not economic at all. Rates are at par with those of luxury hotels. Got for it only if you are short of options.",37
IBIS_BEN,3,“Housekeeping”,"Housekeeping cleans late, towels should be more presentable. When we came back in the afternoon, yhey havent even cleaned the room & changed the towels. The hotel should be a little more generous with your bath soaps.",262
IBIS_BEN,2,“Not a room but a shoebox”,"We arrived in the early hours of the morning. Although we had pre booked and paid, the girl took for ever to check us in. She also had the personality of a dead fish. Not a friendly welcome. We got to our room walking down a long corridor on the 11th floor. As we got closer a noise was getting louder and louder. It was a drink dispensing machine right opposite our door!! Inside we could still hear the machine, which was going to make sleep difficult. Fortunately I found a switch behind the machine and silenced it. The room was very small. It had a queen sized bed that one could just squeeze past to get to the other side. The bathroom was okay and the shower good. We felt as though we were in a shoe box very claustrophobic . The $21.00 was not good value. We found lots of small restaurants within a few hundred yards of the hotel. As we were not departing Singapore until 10.30 pm and there was no late check out, we were forced to buy an extra night, so our shoe box was indeed a very expensive one. Many hotels in Singapore used to have day room rates as so many flights have difficult departure and arrival times, but this practice seems to not be on offer anymore. A room in the airport hotel is the most economical, yet inconvenient for sight seeing. As Singapore hotels are expensive we will stop using Singapore as a transit port if at all possible in the future.",308
IBIS_BEN,3,“A Mixed Experience”,"With one exception, this is a very hard hotel to get excited about because it does just about what you'd expect; no more and no less.On the plus side:- we got a great price for two nights over a weekend- although it's not really centrally located to anything much, it is only about a 5-minute walk to Bugis MRT and the Bugis shopping centre.- the room was spotlessly clean- we were fortunate to be able to check-in early- the car park is good and free to guests- we weren't troubled by noise from other rooms even though the hotel was very busy.- the staff members we came into contact with were polite and very efficient. Speed of response to requests to housekeeping for fresh towels and additional clothes hangers couldn't have been more rapid and put a lot of 5* establishments to shame.- the Wi-Fi is fast (54Mb), free and with no complicated sign-in procedure.On the minus side:- the rooms are tiny. I know that city hotels have small rooms (even the rooms at Traders and the Marriott are tiny) but this is really small and not somewhere to do anything other than sleep. And the bathroom is in miniature - so small that there is nowhere to put a wash bag.- you only get bath towels (no hand towels as well) and they are thin and old and we had to have the first batch changed as they smelled revolting. The replacements, however, were fine.- we didn't really fancy anything from breakfast, which is just a personal thing and hardly matters with the choice available elsewhere.If you just need somewhere clean and reliable to spend a night in this part of town and you can get a promotional rate, then this will meet all your basic needs. Just don't expect much by way of facilities or character.",41
IBIS_BEN,3,“Value for money”,"I stayed here for a 2 days short vacation. The standard room is pretty much small, enough for 2, with a standing shower and a nice amenities. The MRT station was nearby, you just walk about 5 mins from the hotel.",107
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Convenient location, responsive staff, nice restaurant, small room”","Fairly conveniently located, 7 minutes' walk from Bugis MRT (once you've leart the way through the market), 30 minutes away from Changi Airport station, and close to a big Chinese market. The rooms are a bit cramped compared with other hotels of a similar standard. The doors are a bit thin and fail to block outside noise. They also fail to provide complimentary water, and only give one towel per head. On the upside, there is free WiFi.The restaurant food is fairly decent; for SGD 22 you can try your own selection of four local specialities (appetizer-size), including chilli and black pepper crab.The staff are very responsive.",72
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Good value, best location”","Reception staff were lovely, gave us an early check in! My Accor advantage plus points were not credited even though I booked through their website and presented my card at check in, so not sure where that went wrong. We ate in the restaurant every day, you could probably get cheaper breakfasts if you ventured out but it was convient for us. We would stay again if we ever return to Singapore",140
IBIS_BEN,3,“You get what you pay for”,"At less than S$200 a night, ibis @ Bencoolen is certainly an attractive option for those on a budget especially with free wifi thrown in. Guess with access to skype can bypass the S$1 local call charge. Especially convenient also is the bus stop just outside the hotel, the MRT (subway) station and food court just a few minutes walk down the road.My wife and I found the room on the small side with the bathroom having enough space for one user at a time. As mentioned by other guest, the floors are made of wood and the walls thin. This means that conversations made by other guest walking to and from the lifts can be heard. I also personally found the bed too firm for my back although my wife did enjoy the support it gave to her back.",68
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Location,location & location”","the only good thing about this property is its location. It is bang opp the famous Bugis market, vry close to mrt & quiet close to little india also.

IBIS_BEN,3,"“good basic, IBIS standard”","I have stayed here twice because of the Area. I dont want to stay on Orchard chaos and like this little area. You are close to Bugis both shops and MRT, queen st if you are taking bus to JB, walking distance to Chimes entertainment area or Raffles MRT mall etc. There are also many local good eateries close by. Its your standard IBIS and you could be in Paris or Sydney and it would look the same. So if you havent stayed at an IBIS before its small, clean new sleek basic. I payed $7 for wi-fi but believe it free now. Staff helpful and good but front desk always long lines. Weather or not to stay here depends on where you want to stay but this hotel has MRT and you can go most places via that. Also the rate varries a lot and sometimes up to $SG200 which is too much! I value it @ $140. If you need cheaper go to chinatown or Geylan or maybe beach road / seah st area.",151
IBIS_BEN,3,“Overpriced for what you get”,"Only stayed the one night which was a godsend. The rooms are that small that you can only just get your luggage trolley in! The towels were just about see through & both bath towels (that's all you got) were marked & old looking just like the bath mat which was also fraying around the edges. The shower gel was in a dispenser in the shower which fell apart on the first use & that was basically it as far as provided toiletries were concerned. Sorry, I almost forgot the tiny piece of hand soap! Not at all what we expected from the Accor group compared to the Ibis in Bangkok & Melbourne. On the pls side, the front staff were very courteous, giving us the details to access the free wi fi, included city tour & prize draw. The location was also good in regards to accessing the MRT etc.",425
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location and service but bed an issue”,"We stayed at the Ibis for 5 nights and it was our hub for touring around Singapore. We personally thought the hotel was well located (close to Bugis Street and market - not to mention a food hawkers centre which was very convenient and cheap$$ with excellent food SGD3.50 a meal!) and not too far from nearby MRT stations (bout a 10 min walk if that). Room was reasonably priced, quite, and services provided and cleanliness of the hotel was above expectations - staff are friendly and approachable - as are the people of Singapore (which we love). Wifi in the room was a little patchy but that's wasn't a big thing for us. If you wanted uninterrupted Wifi you could just go to the lobby and have it at full signal or even use they're free computers - which we did like. Would I recommend this hotel to family or friends? Probably not. Why? Well we mainly used the hotel for getting rest (as you do on holidays) and spent most of the days walking around the city - Orchard St, Little India (mustafa centre is crazy!), Central district, Zoo, Santosa Island, Marina Bay Sands - to name a few. Hence when we got back to the hotel we'd expect to enjoy a good rest before another big day but, unfortunately, the beds in this particular Ibis are firm - by firm I mean there is no give in the springs of the mattress and it only has a very small topper (which softens it minimally). Whilst I do enjoy a firm mattress this was crazy firm. My Mrs had to sleep on pillows and i'd wake up in the morning with a stiff back and no rest relief - which is the real point of having a hotel - getting some good rest. I did raise the issue with staff who stated all the beds were the same and they attempted to correct the issue (which they did promptly) by placing a doona as an underlay to soften it further but this didn't really resolve the issue as, as donnas do, the softness flattened out during the night and we were back to sleeping on what felt like a concrete slab. If you like your bed firmer than a plank of wood I would recommend this hotel as it's in a good location for the price, clean and the staff are happy to help where they can with a smile. If you don't like such a mattress I'd have to recommend looking elsewhere.",39

The rooms were tidy, clean and the hotel in generally good condition. We had no complaints regarding the room. The only issues we found was that - when we asked to be supplied with a iron and ironing board we were told that we had to go down to the 3rd floor laundry room.

IBIS_BEN,3,“2nd stay”,"On arrival at the Ibis we waited 10 minutes in the lobby before even seeing a check in person. There were 3 people in front of us and no check in people visible. Check in was easy as we had prepaid but the clerk seemed in a hurry and distracted. Our room was on the 8th floor. The room is fine, with a very small fridge, a bed, a hanging area for clothes, a shelf, a desk and chair and a window seat. We didn't plan on spending much time in the room so this is really all that is needed.The bed was too firm for my liking and I don't remember it being like that on our last stay. The pillows were ok. The bathroom is ok, there isn't really enough storage space for toiletries though. I think another shelf would be beneficial. The water pressure was good. We could hear when the people next door had showers though. I found the room to be very noisy. We could often hear noise in the corridors, especially late at night and when housekeeping was around. The housekeepers would knock on each door 4 times and say housekeeping 4 times. It was very annoying as we could hear it clearly. I don't remember the hotel being this noisy the last time we stayed.Elevators were a pain in the morning as they were often full and you would wait a long time. Breakfast on our fist morning was good. Everything was stocked up and service was excellent. As soon as you finished your plate was removed. My husband noticed a reviewer from Accor Hotels group was there taking notes. Unfortunately breakfast on the 2nd day was not as good. Many items were needing to be stocked up, we had to ask for juice and forks and many tables had dirty plates on them. Obviously the day before had been set up to impress the reviewers. Check out was horrible! I waited 30 minutes to check out. There were 2 people serving and one person who seemed to be wondering around. 2 people pushed in front of me and the servers didn't say anything. I was not asked if I had enjoyed my stay or offered assistance with a taxi or baggage storage, I needed to ask myself. I would not stay at the Ibis again. I really feel that the standard has dropped since our last stay in 2010. Especially service and noise level wise.",180

There were no mention of what guests should do, so after waiting for about 5 minutes I popped out of my room to see a few people looking confused about what is going on. Some of us walked to the lift lobby and could see people exiting from the hotel onto the street. We could not see or hear any fire trucks. Being on the 16th floor, which is the top floor, we were getting concerned whether to evacuate as well. After a while, an announcement came through saying it was a \false alarm\"". No apologies!While I have stayed in this hotel many a time over the last few years and had been generally happy, this incident will make me think twice about staying here again.And I do not know why they bother asking for an after-stay survey when they do not bother to respond to my compliant about the \""false alarm\"" incident.""",166

I had to keep the curtains closed at all times so I would not have to look at the gross view out the window. The bathroom is also very small, you get 2 little towels and a bar of soap not much larger than a quarter. There are no irons in the room, if you need one you have to go to a laundry room on the 3rd floor.

It is a business/tourist-class establishment done well, offers good value for money (though not cheap since this is Singapore during the Christmas holidays), knows its niche market preferences and still remains contemporarily stylish. Enough has been said about the strategic location. For drivers, the complimentary car parking is a wonderful. The garage is impeccable. Check-in is supremely professional, swift but warm. The Ibis room prototype appears consistent wherever you go. It is cozily compact but not for the claustrophobic. I've seen smaller in Hong Kong & Japan - spatial perception is relative. The interiors of ubiquitous light timber and bright colors can be both reassuring and repetitively boring. For us, it needed to be a clean comfortable place to sleep, unload our shopping and shower. We were not disappointed on all three counts. Breakfast is straight forward, nothing gourmet about it but healthy, filling and fresh. The crowds during peak hours can be a turn-off so try to get there early. Late risers get an abbreviated version at the bar - which was rather thoughtful. Checking out was a breeze. Would i recommend Ibis Bencoolen? Without a doubt.",172
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Nice hotel, average service, great location”","While I usually expect a lot more from Singapore hotels an Ibis will be an Ibis, so i was not really shocked to see the lack of porter service. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Housekeeping is fantastic. The rest however not so much. The staff at reception on check in were great but after that everyone else looked not interested in helping me or answering my queries. While I waited for someone to assist me (which they did 15 mins later), I could hear laughter coming from the back office. I do encourage a friendly work environment but at the expense of your guest? Wanted to order room service in the night and the girl told me i should just go out and eat as she had closed her shift even thought it did have a 24 hr limited menu. Breakfast however was great and the staff all smiles. its a good hotel and can be a great if the staff can be more attentive and willing to help.",59
IBIS_BEN,3,“Convenient Location & Cooperative Staff”,Overall Cleanliness in hotel was very good. Rooms are small but; was okay with us since most of the time we were busy visiting places. Breakfast menu was same for all three days. Need to give some variations. However overall we had no complaints.Convenient location : MRT station is just 5 minutes away. Bus & taxi were easily available.,60
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good Hotel”,"Location is good. My arrival time is after 3pm, still no rooms available for me when check. I booked 2 rooms, I have requested them to give me 1 room for keeping the lugguages and let my children to go toliet, because our schedule was super tight, but they rejected. But the night-shift receptionist, Airi is very nice guy. Thanks!",108
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good Location”,"Since I arrived late (10 pm), was concerned about still having my reservation, but there was no problem.My room was well thought out, being that it was quite small and as I was by myself, had enough room to move about. Two people of larger size might have a problem.The bathroom amenities were skimpy, a sliver of a soap, no shower cap ,no toothbrush, etc.There is a 7/11next door where one can get supplies.The day before my departure my room was never made up, even though I was gone for most of the day.The convenient location of this hotel and friendliness of the staff, was certainly a plus.",117
IBIS_BEN,3,“value for money”,"we stayed i this hotel for 2 nights break, on route to another country. we booked our room well in advance. after 20 hours travel. arriving at the hotel. 10 am . we asked if our room was available. they told us check inn was not until 2pm. so very tired we had to wait until that given time. While we were waiting at the reception. just after 12am. we noticed that other guests were already checking inn, so i asked if our room was available again. this time. the paperwork was sitting on the desk at reception.. not impressive staff. internet was slow. and unsecure. rooms were nice, for a budget room. loaction was good .",35
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location”,"This hotel is conveniently located to the main strip shopping district. The rooms are pretty tiny, but they serve their purpose. We never had any noise problems. There's a bar downstairs with some interesting libations.",96
IBIS_BEN,3,“Overall good”,"Stayed there for a business trip. Overall it was good; clean and recent. It was my first time in Singapore so I can't compare it with other hotels. Staff were friendly but they don't seem to be knowledgeable enough for touristic information. When I asked one of them for the closest hop on hop off touristic bus station, he didn't know where it was and he refereed me to their local bus lines which made me more confused. I will not stay it next time because I found the location was also so so for me.",139
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ok for a couple of nights”,"We stayed here for 2 nights to break up our journey from Europe. The location is fine , the rooms are some of smallest I've come across - you certainly wouldn't want to be here for long. If you are as keen a shopper as I am you'd have a job storing your goodies! It was perfectly clean if a little soulless and the staff were a bit distant - only to be expected given the size of the place and the throughput of people. We didn't eat there at all, we went for breakfast just across the road and to the left in a little Indian place where we had roti and curry for not much money at all compared to the silly prices in the hotel. I always think hotel breakfasts are a rip-off to be honest.",105
IBIS_BEN,3,“ibis singapore - a first time”,"A decently priced hotel in a prime location in Singapore, such balance are hard to find.They can however improve in the check in and check out procedure by making it easier for online booking patrons to as well get their room number online and be able to print the temporary key that they can replace with the original key upon entering the hotelThis idea is similar to the online check of airlines that saves queuing and make process faster.The room size can also be improved by making the rooms 1pc twin bed than 2 single beds.Needs improvement to reduce noise levels on rooms and corridors.",52
IBIS_BEN,3,“holiday”,the rooms are small and there is no bath tub I brought my 2 children along and when i requested for addirional mattress the hotel told me they dont have and i have to sleep on the floor the hotel should provide bins outside the hotel room or near the lift lobby,138
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average value for money; detached staff”,"In spite being one of Accor's newer properties, the Ibis Bencoolen is average across the board. The location is tight in the financial district of Singapore with staff distinctly and unusually for a Singapore hotel seemingly detached. Front office staff did the bare minimum and were economic with answers to seemingly straightforward questions. The worst example of this was the Cafe in the evening where a male member gave completely the wrong information on three tasters for the price of S$15 saying it was compulsory to order 2 sets as we were a couple, something disputed by his colleague. Rooms were tightly built with two people finding it difficult to move around.The firm bed, pillows and the shower were the best aspect of the hotel. I can think of better hotels and after three nights we checked out.",147
IBIS_BEN,3,“Well located and comfortable”,"The Ibis hotel is in convenient location- close to shops and a few small restaurants. It's also easy to get taxis here. The room and bathroom are clean, neat and compact. The essential amenities are provided in the room. The breakfast is good. The restaurant & bar in the hotel also provide tasty meals but the portion size is quite small.The only major drawbacks of this hotel, are that the lifts are not synchronized which could be quite annoying as you have to wait a long time for them, specially in the mornings. Secondly, the sound-proofing of the rooms aren't good so if you have noisy neighbours, you can say good-bye to your sleep. Also, the staff are not very warm and welcoming however, they do help when asked. Overall, it's a good budget hotel which is perfect for a short stay when touring or on business.",261
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Comfortable, but limited facilities for the price”","The Ibis on Bencoonen is a well-located hotel, although my taxi driver had to consult with several colleagues in the taxi-rank at the airport to obtain its location.The tariff charged is hardly ‘budget’, but it seems ‘par for the course’ in Singapore- although similar in price to the 5 star Sofotel we stayed at in Cairo on the same holiday. The rooms are comfortable, although small and lacking storage. The breakfast is good, although expensive. I don’t think that a glorified snack-bar cafe (One by the Bar) and a ‘restaurant’ (Taste) that only has a 20 item mezze/tappas style menu count as 2 restaurants, but given the location finding suitable eating places outside the hotel is not a problem. The food is very good and reasonably priced, but drinks are expensive (a beer is S$10!!).There is no room service offered, but the ‘restaurant’ is apparently open 24 hours. There is a laundrette, at a cost of $4 per wash and $4 per dry (so keep those $1 coins!).I was pleased that our checking in at 6.00am caused no problem, but for S$160 a night I would have expected a porter to assist with the luggage (apparently not offered no matter what time you check in).The staff were good enough to suggest that I change money elsewhere as the hotel offers a poor exchange rate. I never did locate the place they suggested...There is a 711 next door to buy beer and snacks, and a Burger King is opposite for the kids. The water in Singapore is drinkable.Adequate, but not good value,",41
IBIS_BEN,1,“too bad a hotel to stay”,The first shock was the internet was terrible and no conceirge in the hotel. Nothing was provided. No cupboard in the room and no table. Nor thier was place for keeping the luggage. i would never stay again in an IBIS.,57
IBIS_BEN,3,“Clean but small rooms and no pool!”,"Good if travelling for business and just need a room to come back to at the end of the day. We only had a standard room, perhaps there are better ones. THe restaurant though was amazing! Yummy food. Bit overpriced as is all restaurants at hotels. Good location though for a walk through some shops and markets.",292
IBIS_BEN,3,“The Importance of Space or lack of it !”,"Well, I knew it was coming the moement our travel desk informed of our late booking in IBIS Singapore, Bencoolen (as now there are 2, one in Novena), I knew its going to be very basic, small, no frills and budget but I had no idea on the magnitude!! but hey thats what they are famous for,,for being a lean, to the point, serve yourself and pay us model.On the location: Superb, right next to Bugis and close to MRT and a Bus stop with a nicely packed 7/11 in the next buildingOn the staff: Young, energetic and hence may be error prone (swiped my card 3 times in 3 different currencies while checking out!!)On the Food : Will survive you well but wont stay in your memoryOn the price: ATrocious!!! I paid some S$ 350 for that!! Agreed we are in Singapore where everything is a little Dearer than anywhere else but then too!!Rooms : It ends the moment you open the door, i measured and it was 3 strides and i was out of the room thru the window buyt it was designed nicely so in all that space, they had TV rack, Magazines, Table & Chair, Suitacase rack and a whole Bathroom with shower, wash basin (Tap water being potable) and a W.C (NO TOILET SHOWER THOUGH!!)The hotel is 24/7 with a compact bar and again an overpriced food menu howver at 13 S$ you get a nice combo so go for that as it would be cheaper than taking individual order.The lobby is compact and functional, 3 desks for check in check out, trolleys in parking lot for you to carry your luggage, 4 lifts : all very functional for a \short\"" and \""sharp\"" stay while in Singapore.""",108
IBIS_BEN,3,“Moderate hotel but good value”,"I stayed at the Ibis Bencoolen in Jan 2013 for 3 nights. The room was slightly on the small side but the bed was comfortable and bathroom facilities were pretty much in line with what you'd expect from a budget IBIS. In terms of location, it is relatively well placed for the Chinese and Indian quarters but a bit of a walk (say 25 minutes) to get to the Marina Bay area. Overall I'd recommend this hotel if you're on a budget but if you can afford to spend a bit more you will find far better placed hotels on Orchard road or further south in Marina Bay.",42
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ibis Bencoolen”,"Room setup is simple, tidy bed and clean. Room is very small and not much facilities provided. While it is quite strategic, nearby Bugis MRT with local market attractions nearby, the price is on the high side for such a small room.",86
IBIS_BEN,1,“On the dot... NOT!”,"Accommodation is very good but then upon checkout and I was running a little late to get to the airport, front desk does not seem to cooperate. I was locked out from my room that prevented me from getting my bags and I have to circle back 3 times from the 6th floor to the lobby to have them fix the issue.Bottom line, i missed my flight and had to purchase a very expensive ticket to get me back home. Very unacceptable service. Hope this helps!",50
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen”,"The room was clean and tidy. The location was reasonable good. Not far from two train stations and walkable to the city centre. Also close to many shops and conveniences.Upon request I was allowed to check out late, which helped a lot to take advantage of the morning for sightseeing.",41
IBIS_BEN,3,“good location but no character”,we choose this hotel for its location rather than character. Its really more suited as a business hotel. Easy walking distance into the city & to transport links. Had a small restaurant but with limited food options later on at night.,53
IBIS_BEN,3,“A good budget hotel in the city area of Singapore”,"Can be considered for low budget stays. No luxuries. Reasonably trained staff to take care of basic needs. Very small room size but clean. Their claim to fix anything wrong in 15 minutes, look genuine. Quite close to Lim SIm Sqaure ( a huge computer market) and at walkable distance from Little India",165
IBIS_BEN,3,“bed too firm”,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights. The first time was a queen sized bed which was fine, but the second night I was in a slightly larger room with a king bed that was so firm I tossed and turned all night unable to get comfortable. The rooms were clean, small in size and very basic. There are trolleys at reception to handle your own luggage. The services provided are basic and not what you would get from a luxury hotel.The hotel is walking distance to Little India (about 20 minutes) and Bugis.Though there was nothing wrong with the hotel, I found the price to not be worth paying as what you received was very basic albeit clean- for only a little bit more I was able to get a booking at a 5 star hotel on Orchard Rd, which provided all the luxuries such as a concierge to carry your bags, and a large bathroom with spa bath and a spacious room.",55
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Expensive for what you get, but great location”","The hotel was more on the budget side - small, basic rooms, no facilities, no breakfast - but was in a good location Bugis with lots of malls, Little India and Little China. Bugis station was a quick 5 minute walk away as well. It should have been $110~/night and it was have been perfect.",109
IBIS_BEN,3,“Outstanding staff”,"Singapore is an expensive destination, so in that context an \economy\"" hotel for around $160 a night is reasonable. On the plus side, the staff at the Ibis on Bencoolen is impressive. From reception to housekeeping to the restaurant, all staff were polite, well trained, and helpful. The location is very good with access to major attractions and to the MRT station, and the breakfast buffet is world class. The down side is the room design. Although amenities are there, the rooms are very small and badly designed. In spite of this, I would stay at this Ibis again - just won't spend too much time in the room.""",51
IBIS_BEN,3,“Middle of the Bencoolen Road”,"Hotels in Singapore are expensive. Ibis is too! But only averagelyso. Breakfast is a little high at SGD 18 and lacks quality, however the current offering of 5 reasonable sized portions of local food for SGD 22 is very good value.Front desk staff are helpful and the location is OKAY too.",39
IBIS_BEN,3,“Breakfast buffet”,"The breakfast buffet range is limited but decent. Do not expect a lot from the price paid. I suggest for casual dining, you can go to bugis street or Victoria street. It is a wrong throw from the hotel",113
IBIS_BEN,3,"“simple Hotel, OK for a few nights”","was staying there for 3 nights. found some hairs from previous guests on the bed and in the bathroom. the rooms are very small and noisy. the service was not good, they advertise with a guaranteed 15 minutes for all guest's needs. So I have ordered food to the room but I had to pick it up in the kitchen on my own. Then I have asked for a power adapter on the phone, I had to pick myself at the reception. Well, I didn't really understand their meaning of service but I guess that's spoiled Singapore. And it was definitely the most expensive Ibis Hotel I have ever stayed in world wide!",89
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Great location,nice hotel,too expensive.”",I should acknowledge that all accomodation in Singapore is too expensive so I guess they are forgiven. The location of the hotel is very handy to the rail station and is in walking distance to the Bugis night markets which are literally just around the corner. The staff are all polite and helpfull and the rooms although small are serviceable. Breakfast was quite good and had enough variety on offer to please most travellers. All in all not a bad place to stay - a good 3 star hotel.,65
IBIS_BEN,2,“Pretty poor”,Very disappointing.No hand towels in the bathroom. When i asked for them i got face washers - and they were not replaced next day.Beers advertised at $5 actually cost $6 with surcharge and GST - no explanation given at all. How can you advertise at $5 and expect people to pay $6 - daylight robbery.Free Wi-fi took 2 days to connect and was terribly slow.,46
IBIS_BEN,3,“No one answer the guest service hotline”,"I call the guest service hotline many time, but no answer / busy line. The call is from 8pm to 11pm and tried 8-10 times. Then I go down to the counter ask for help. It's not good service. Other than that, the staffs are nice",41
IBIS_BEN,3,“very closely”,"in room there are all necessary ,but very little space! for exploring this part of the Singapore-worthy!.acceptable price for acceptable quality..across the street is a huge market of electronic products. keep the Deposit on the card 80 SGD within two weeks..",62
IBIS_BEN,3,“clean hotel”,it's a long walk to reach bugis mrt station. I wish they had a connecting room with queen size beds. all they had are connecting rooms with 2 twin beds in each room. that would be hard for parents with 2 small kids below 5 years old who sleep beside their parents. I wish their front desk personnel would speak clear english.,339
IBIS_BEN,3,“Right in the city”,"Stayed here for a few days. Since it is very much a city center hotel, it was just a place to sleep, shop, go back to unload and then do the same. Its very convenient to all areas and buses and taxi are plenty. As for eating, well................. right in front of the entrance ( facing the temple ), there are plenty of food and the hawker center serve good rojak, slice fish noodle, chui kueh ( a kind of radish cake with the marinated radish sauce.. yummy.. call Bedok chui Kueh ) and another serve lovely chinese style breakie. My viewsRooms - if you are expecting a big room, forget it, so do not try to put 4 in a room if you book for 2. I would say a decent room.Restaurant - there is one but why would you eat in a hotel ( unless its included )... just walk around and find something to eat. Taxi/bus - easily available but during peak timing around 1700-1930 you might find a bit harder to catch a taxi. Bus are the most frequent and they have sigh board telling you how to get from point a to b if you know where to go. In the subway... its most unlikely you will get a seat so a bus is wonderful if you just want to soak in the sights.wifi - added bonus.... what i feel most hotel should do is give free wifi to all paying guest. That is why some go for guesthouse... yes yes i know not a comparison but the thing is.. most people i talked to.. if the company provide i will go to hotels and i go alone, i will use guesthouse.... in any case guesthouse lets you make more friends are in hotel you just go into the rooms and that is that.TV - NOW why would i talk about it... hahahah its one of the smallest screen tv i have seen, almost comparable to someone's pc screen.Overall - Not bad... good location",51
IBIS_BEN,2,“Ibis Bencoolen”,"Good location, very hard bed, rooms too small for anything but overnight stay. No comfortable chair in room - only one wooden seat for 2 people!

IBIS_BEN,3,“good stay”,"The Trip Advisor hotel rating has a very good and average rating - I rate this Hotel as Good in-between the two.I stayed with my wife and two (8 and 7 year old ) children in 2 separate rooms next to each other for 7 days.We were out sight seeing everyday - leaving early and getting back to the Hotel after 6pm each day. Surprisingly there is quite a lot to see and do in Singapore and across in Malaysia as a day trip.Rooms: The rooms were Small but were very clean so no issues . I have traveled to Singapore frequently and the size is about average for Singapore.Location: The location was good and is walking distance to a number of attractions and shopping centers and food locations.Food: Breakfast was included in rate and was good and had a reasonable range however due to the volume of people staying at the hotel the morning team had a hard time replenishing the food , cutlery and plates. We only had breakfast at the Hotel so cannot comment on the food otherwise.Service: Staff were attentive and well focused and were able to assist on most issues. Only minor issues in room servicing around replacing soap etc...Value: The Hotel overall was reasonable value as it included good free internet.Sleep: One issue is the sound leakage from the hallways into the rooms. Most people are respectful of keeping quiet in the hallway however some disregard this unspoken rule. Given the cosmopolitan nature of the clients in the hotel I suggest some signs be put up to encourage people to tone it down.Other: My son had a allergic reaction to some food and the staff were very helpful in directing us to a very good clinic just across the road who promptly looked after him.",272
IBIS_BEN,3,“Small but clean - good location for a fair price”,"I stayed here after a business trip for added personal vacation. The price was good compared to others in the area - and the hotel was clean and well kept. I had a standard full bed room which was very, very small. There was barely room for my luggage and I had to cram my carry on-size bag on top of a desk. The bathroom was also very small and difficult to maneuver in - bring toiletries! They did not have any. However, overall the room was very clean and crisp/modern. The bed was comfortable and there was AC - so for a single traveler, it was a good homebase to travel from. I would not recommend it for couples or if you would like a nice place to stretch out and relax. The best part was the location - all the cultural sights and neighborhoods were within walking distance (5-20 min walk). There are two nearby metro stations to get to farther out attractions, they are about a 15 minute walk away. This walk can be a bit long after a long day around the city, but it's still pretty good. I did not eat any food at this hotel, though they had a small cafe in the lobby. It was very overpriced, but that's Singapore. They also had free internet, which is difficult to come by in Singapore hotels, so that was a plus. Overall, considering the general size and price of everything in this city, this hotel is a nice, clean, well-located place to stay for tourists that don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room.",36
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location”,"The location very convinient to access any where in Singapore. Room a little bit small. Nice bar and restaurant, Breakfast buffet pretty nice. Free WIFI at Lobby and Room. 24hr COnvinient store service near by hotel.",124

The Ibis comes in exceptionally cheap and is good value at the Internet prices. And you do get what you pay for. The hotel rooms are quite tiny, but they are efficient and comfortable. The hotel services are sufficient, staff are friendly and helpful, good Wifi in the rooms, restaurants are ok, but there are heaps of great eating options in the neighborhood. You could try Fattys across the road for example. As a business base in this hectic city the Ibis is a handy well located option. There is nothing wrong with the Ibis, it is just not classy ... But it is good value.",44
IBIS_BEN,3,“Acceptable”,"We were unable to check-in until 5.00pm which caused us to miss our first meeting. Apart from that, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are very small. I do not enjoy a price increase because there was a convention in town.",70
IBIS_BEN,3,“Check out painfully slow”,"Checking out at this hotel has to be one of the most exasperating experience; not only do I have to confirm expenses incurred during the stay by checking the items on the computer screen, I then have to wait while the check out clerk fills out a voucher manually listing every single item on the screen, and then request that I sign it as well. What a waste of time!",39
IBIS_BEN,3,“Expensive”,"It has all the basics though the rooms are pretty small. While the hotel is clean and at a convenient location it is becoming increasingly expensive and therefore unaffordable, sadly. Will probably stay in other hotels nearby next time.",113

IBIS_BEN,3,"“great staff, but not the cleanest”","stayed here for 4 nights. singapore hotels are expensive in general and this one is comparatively reasonably priced at about 180SGD per night.check-in staff are helpful and multilingual. staff said printer was broken so they gave me an email address to send them the materials to print and they printed them for me for free. that was very helpful and generous of ibis. expectation of the size of the room was contained after reading tripadvisor comments, and the room is actually not as small as i thought. it's adequate for two. the room and bathroom \appeared\"" clean.slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste are not provided. the shampoo is used for both hair and body (and we know this means so-so quality). advise bringing your own. water did not drain very well in the shower stall. i could smell the drainage while in the shower. the connector of the shower head is faulty, water kept spraying everywhere. when it came time for bed, i lifted the blanket and saw some brown stains on the side of the bed sheet. called and someone came within minutes. he came with a new bed sheet but realized that it was also stained. then he came with 3 more bed sheets.. all of which were stained in different manners. we felt bad for him and settled for one which wasn't stained as badly. between the mattress and the bed sheet, there is another layer of covering (which supposedly keeps the mattress clean in case the bed sheet is soiled). since the bed sheet was lifted, we saw that this layer was stained right in the middle and on the left side. this is quite awful, as it means that ibis does not change it and wash it as often as they should (most people do not see this layer, unless they had the bed sheet lifted like we did) we requested that this be changed too, and we are glad that they found us a clean one. on the tv they play a programme that introduces all the fun things to do in singapore (i am not sure if it is produced by the hotel). i recommend that tourists watch it! the hotel is located about 5-10 min walk from Bugis station (green line) and also Bras Basah (yellow line - hope i got the spelling right) which makes it convenient to go places. the yellow line actually goes round a big circle so for some places (like the singapore botanical garden) it makes much more sense to take the cab (only 6-7SGD, a 10-15 min ride?) than MRT (takes half an hour+). cabs are readily available outside the hotel. i think this hotel is suitable for people who are not too picky about cleanliness. for me, i would not stay again.""",160

Small bathroom, big size guests would find it challenging to move in the shower cubicle. Not much of a view from the room, we have one that was facing Bugis Junction. It was blocked by apartments. There is a vendoring machine for water and soft drinks at the corridor of each floor. No room service and the cafe on the ground floor only serve limited food and drinks after 11 pm.

IBIS_BEN,3,“Review of Ibis Bencoolen”,"The room was OK but rather small. No room for suitcases & little to no area for hanging clothes or drawers for clothes so had to live from my suitcase. Once I got used to the limited space I felt more comfortable, but at first I was disappointed.Only 3 staff at reception so every time I went to reception I had a least a 10 minute wait.Room cleaning staff were excellent...professional & polite.Location of the hotel is excellent. Hotels in Singapore (in general) are not good value when compared to Hong Kong...why have the room prices increased so much in the last few years ? This Hotel does not have a swimming pool. Overall the hotel is good.",75

In this Singapore hotel, I felt like I felt in an Ibis hotel in Bordeaux (France).

IBIS_BEN,3,"“Over-priced hotel (unrestricted rate), feels quote confined and a bit despressing”","Singapore hotels are very expensive compared to other parts of Asia.

Hotel staff seems to do their job well and I had no issues with them. They are courteous and helpful. Rooms are clean, well equipped and their free WIFI works well (except at night when most people are in browsing).The room has one very small window. I totally HATED their bathroom. It feels like college dorm's shared facility and is not inviting. The sink has no place to put your toiletry and overall it feels like public bathrooms.Overall, I felt depressed while staying there for few days.

I went to the room (514) it was a handicapped room with mostly toilet space, i complained but the receptionist said all room booked that is the only one available.i waited for 10 minutes and talked to another receptionist, he said, you do not like your room ? ok i change to other room, room 501. bad experience, first time to stay and will not come back.""",89

There are food stalls close to the hotel, but they don't provide western breakfast :-)The location wasn't that good, because it's quite a walk to the nearest MRT or anywhere interesting actually. Sim Lim square is close though for all you gadget freaks.Next time I will choose something with a better location.",59
IBIS_BEN,3,“Quite convenient but distinctly average”,"A short walk from Bugis Junction, but not easy with a suitcase.The rooms were quite small for the price (GBP100) and although these are Ibis standard size, I would expect to pay half that in other cities where I regularly stay with Ibis.The breakfast was nice and staff generally pleasant. I will stay at the novotel next time though!",46
IBIS_BEN,3,“Room too small”,"The room is too small, quite far from MRT station... But easy to find food around hotel area. Room is clean. House keeping sometimes quite annoying, just knock the door then open the door in a seconds, don't care if there are guests inside the room.",119
IBIS_BEN,2,"“Well located, but not worth the money”","Centrally located you would find most of the places of interest in close vicinity. However the hotel room is as small as it could have been. Its impossible to keep your bag in the room and not walking over it from one side of the bed to the other. The rooms however were neat and gave the look of the most basic possible business hotel.I would recommend that you should stay with IBIS only if you are running low on budget or you are a super loyal accor group member.The breakfast is good, however the breakfast area like the rest of the hotel is squeezed into a small area, specially considering the number of people staying in the hotel.",25

IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location! Bit noisy in the evenings”,"Small and well serviced rooms, typical for any Ibis hotel. Location wise was excellent being close to the MRT stations. The only complaint would be the need to have all the lights left on in the room during the day. I see no reason for this, they could save on their electricity bill..!!!Seems strange when Singapore is promoting its self as a model city in terms of sustainability. Maybe hotels should take the lead in the sustainability push and switch of the lights.....!!!!",86
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Not really a business hotel, but nice enough anyway”","I was in town for a business trip. This place is full of vacationers and young people, but close enough to the train station to work for me. The rooms are small, have a small fridge and hot water pot, and wifi. There is a coin laundry in the building and the breakfast buffet is pretty good and not too exorbitant. There are places to eat and things to do within very close walking distance, and the real downtown area is only about 20 minutes walk.",102
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Aside the location, it's average”","Stayed here for 2 nights during vacation. It has a good location with easy access to the Bugis area. The street market in this area is very lively and provide lots of souvenirs and other stuffs.Just in front of the hotel, you can find a free shuttle bus goes directly to Resort world Sentosa and Universal Studio. The shuttle bus runs every 30 minutes.Aside from the location, it's an average hotel like most Ibis around the world. Reception was good and helpful. Small rooms with small shower area. Breakfast was not automatically included in the room's rate, which I don't find comfortable.",35
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good for business trips”,"Clean, decent hotel. Was pricey at 220 s$. rooms had the bare essentials, clean and good thing was free wifi which is usually charged in Singapore. Best for biz trips of 2 or 3 days.",211
IBIS_BEN,3,“Singapore Ibis”,"We stayed in Ibis, Bencoolen Street, Singapore during our holiday in May 2012. We asked for interconnecting rooms, for my wife and me and one for the children, but they did not have any when we checked in so had to settle for two adjacent rooms. The rooms were a tight fit even for two and with luggage just about able to move about. The ensuite bathroom is just that - able to squeeze in. There was no iron in the room though they did have a kettle with the usual tea/coffee stuff. The staff is courteous and provides good guidance to tourists. The location is not central, but given the fact that it is commutable to major tourist places by taxi, it is fine. Foreign tourists have the advantage of taking the Universal Studios/Sentosa courtesy coach every hour in front of the hotel, as also get dropped back. The hotel provides free wifi which is good. The breakfast spread is ok, but being vegetarians had very limited choices. Ibis could plan to improve this, since lots of Indians were staying in the hotel. The lift moves with the room access card and we found it funny that even the lobby level washrooms could be used only with the access card.",125
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average Hotel”,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms are quite small so if you are traveling with a big luggage, you might find this to be less convenient. Rooms have all the basic amenities.Staff are pleasant and quite helpful. Housekeeping team was efficient.The nearest MRT (EW 12 Bugis) is approximately 0.6km away. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel.Halal food available right across the street and further down Bugis Junction. There's also a 7-11 and Guardian next to the hotel.If you are type that prefers to lounge in your room after a day of shopping or sightseeing, you will not appreciate the size of the room.Personally, it is good for a short stay.Nearby attractions - Bugis Junction and Bugis Street market.",245
IBIS_BEN,3,"“A decent room in a safe area close enough to the city centre, but...”","The good: The location is great for exploring the city. Right across from Little India and a local market, and very easy access to the main attractions through MRT. The 7/11 next door opens 24 hours, the room includes a fridge and Kettle and mine was very clean when I arrived. Check in was nothing special. The young receptionists were not as friendly as I´m used to in Vietnam, but it was efficient enough.The bad: I left my luggage (one sports style bag) at the hotel when I checked out. They have a cordoned area right by their reception so I felt it was safe enough. When I collected it at the end of the day I did not check its contents, as I had my documents with me and only weekend clothes in it. At the airport security found a laptop in my bag through their X-rays machine. As I denied I had one, airport´s security had to investigate and consequently I missed my flight. I spent two hours at the airport until I was clear to go. The hotel informed me that a customer had mistaken my bag and placed her laptop (a small notebook) in mine, which would not have happened if the hotel´s staff had been careful not to let anyone near the baggage area. They offered me a complementary room for the night and reimbursed me the $100 dollars extra I had to pay for a next day flight :(",43
IBIS_BEN,3,“Very Singapore”,"Clean, smallie tiny rooms, great breakfast, super clean, soul less corridors...and overpriced! Good hotel if you can get a deal. Well located near to centre of town and close to little India.I'd probably find somewhere cheaper next time, but this place is Ok.",99
IBIS_BEN,3,“Overpriced”,"The hotel was fairly good for an Ibis. The room was tiny, very bare, very utilitarian but quite new & clean. Morning buffet breakfast was better than expected. The nearest MRT station is Bugis which is about 10 min walk away. Behind the hotel is a 100-year old Kuan Im temple and a Hindu temple. I went for a morning run and reached the National Museum & Fort Canning park in 5 min. All was pretty good except for the price which is about SGD 200, more expensive than the Concorde on Orchard Rd. if you book thru agoda!",116
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location but zero on frills”,"The stay was comfortable without a doubt, but the room size was very small indeed. Just goes to underline how photographs can be very tricky indeed on Agoda or hotel websites. I had chosen this place for its location and while Bencoolen Street is shut down till 2017 for MRT lines, the rates have had no impact whatsoever.Breakfast is nice though comes at a price. The biggest setback is that the hotel doesnt serve any food after 12am and direct you to the Mamak shop opposite them, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.Wifi was good, no complaints there. I would say come here for Little India; it's closeby and Indians would like the deal.",119
IBIS_BEN,1,"“Bad : Cockroaches In Room, Release of Guests' Information”","We used to stay at Ibis Bencoolen Singapore until recently when we decided not to stay there anymore. Cockroach appeared in our room twice - once during each stay (March and April 2012). We've also seen some Front Desk staff recycled unused paper (like wrong or excessively printed Statement of Account) with guests' personal information, and giving these paper to other guests as writing paper, and this has been happening for more than one year despite some reminders to the hotel management. The hotel restaurant was okay, but the above issues made us feel very unsafe and insecured staying at this hotel. Hotels, especially like Ibis, are supposed to give their guests peace of mind as well as security.",108
IBIS_BEN,3,“Great value in Singapore”,"This IBIS on Bencoolen is certainly nothing to rave about but it's definitely a great deal considering the prices of other comparable hotels in Singapore. The location is central and right next to an MRT station, which is convenient, however there's not much to see right in the vicinity. Rooms are small but very clean and free WIFI is a huge plus. There is a very small 24 hour hawker centre that serves Indian cuisine - the food was excellent. This was great for us since we arrived in Singapore in the middle of the night. I'd recommend this hotel to travelers looking for convenience rather than comfort.",36
IBIS_BEN,3,“Great location”,"This is our third times stayed at IBIS Bencoolen, everything stayed the same, clean n great location. But this time we were greeted by less friendly front desk staff, may it's a bad day for her.",80
IBIS_BEN,1,“Fine if you're happy to stay in a room the size of a small cupboard”,We really regret booking this place- the bed was rock hard and the room was tiny with no space to store luggage or move around properly. The hairdryer in the bathroom was terrible- one of the old fashioned ones that you have to hold the button down on to operate. Consequently I have repetitive strain injury and still damp hair.Hotels are expensive in Singapore but spending a few extra dollars will get you a much better place than the Ibis.,181
IBIS_BEN,3,"“perfect location, average rooms and service”","The room was small yet clean, which is so typically Ibis, but that wasn't an issue since it was comfy and effective. Bathroom was fine with shower, supplies were enough for us. The location is perfect, very near to Bugis MRT Station (since almost everywhere in Singapore is accessible by MRT it's really a benefit). Bugis Junction, Simlim, Bugis Street, and Little India is within walking distance, and plenty of food choices around. My favorite was a small restaurant across the hotel called Al-Jilani. They provide nice fried rices and fresh fruit juices (tips: when in Singapore and want to have fruit juice, it's better to ask the seller if it's fresh or not!). Staffs were okay, too (as long as you don't expect nice hellos or friendly smiles and nods like in Four Seasons). Seven-eleven is just a few steps away, and oh, the hotel also provides laundromat on 3rd floor, so say goodbye to pricey laundry costs.Overall, staying here was all about sleeping well, nothing more. I'm probably not coming back, unless I need to stay around Bugis area.",203
IBIS_BEN,3,“Just a lil something to add and the experience would be much more valued.”,"There is NO ROOM SERVICE available in this hotel. One thing to consider as every living thing on earth needs food. Today's life encourage people to have meals in all hours there is. Workload has turn each individual to have a very different biological food cycle. Sure there's a 7-11 available 24/7 but imagine a room service with simple menu available at all hours. Wouldn't it be so much better for all of us? The other thing there is a SEMI-CONCIRGE desk offered. There is no bell attendant to help guest with their bags, instead an airport trolley owned by hotel is given out to guests as an assistance offered. The elevator is just big enough for one trolley and 2 persons. One main reason for people to want to stay in a hotel, other than needing a place to sleep, is to enjoy being serviced. Isn't that the basic ideas to measure how likable you wanna be? Understanding not only what guests need but also what they want. :)Overall my stay was okay. It provides my needs. Just that more services to add to the hotel would be amazing. With the price range offered, the limitation of service is quite acceptable. :)",106
IBIS_BEN,3,“Very poor internet service”,"It is impposible to complete my work without the internet service. I contacted the front dest and claimed about the very very slow internet service. The answer was that over 300 people using the service, and the result , the system is overloaded. I don't appreciate the answer. The hotel should estimate the heaviest situation, and prepare the capacity of the service accordingly. There was a sign on the wall : we fix your problem in 15 minutes. You didn't fix my problem at all. This hotel is not suitable for the business person who needs the internet service at all. I can't stay there again.",230
IBIS_BEN,3,“Why so many great reviews?”,"The hotel is fine. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and just about what you'd expect from an Ibis hotel. However, the peripherals leave a lot to be desired.(1) I received a note in my room asking me to 'phone the duty manager. My immediate assumption was that my mother had died. (She's currently in very poor health.) I felt pretty distraught. But no, someone had made an allegation that I'd been smoking in my room. I don't smoke and never have. The experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. The hotel handled the situation very poorly.(2) The food in the restaurant is pretty dire. My companion and I tried a sort of tasting menu with six different dishes. The crab in the chilli crab was clearly frozen and tasteless. Ditto the prawns in the sweet/sour prawns. A dish of beef (tough as old boots) and noodles in broth was stodgy and vile. The stingray with blob of sauce on top was disgusting. In fact, of all six dishes, only one was remotely passable - the mixed satay.(3) The hotel only has four lifts. Even though half the floors appear currently to be closed off (presumably because it's low season), the wait for a lift was bad, and the lift when it eventually arrived was often full.I'm not saying \don't stay here\"", but just don't expect too much.""",683
IBIS_BEN,3,“Small yet comfortable”,"The Ibis Hotel in Bencoolen was the first Ibis I have stayed at here in Asia though I had stayed at Ibis in Paris, France. I've stayed at the sister Novotel hotel in Clarke Quay on multiple occassions while on business. The vibe in the Bugis area though is quite different compared to Clarke Quay and so is the hotel. The room is certainly much smaller. Pretty much it's the bed, side tables, a small work desk beside the window and a small closet and minibar. The in room safe was big enough for my Ipad but would not fit my 15\ notebook. The bathroom was quite cramped but had all the necessities. The minibar was actually empty but served its purpose of cooling whatever drink I bought from the 7-11 next door. There was free and fast WiFi service in the room as well as the lobby. The service allowed upto 5 devices to be connected using the same User ID, which was quite a welcome surprise given that other hotels still charge an arm and a leg for just one device to be connected.Service left some room to be desired. I arrived quite early around 7AM from an overnight flight from India and was told the hotel was fully booked and no room was available and the earliest they could get me into one was around 9:30 AM. So I went out and had breakfast and came back around the appointed time only to be told that no room was as yet available. I mentioned to the front desk staff that I was coming in from a flight and really just wanted to get a quick shower, put on fresh clothes and catch a few winks; all to no avail though. I decided to just stick around near the reception area in the hope that as soon as a room was available I would be informed and checked-in readily. 10 AM came and I had to be the one to follow-up again and only then was I finally given my room. The 2nd day of my stay I left the room around 10 AM to go around and have lunch and placed the make up the room sign on the door. As I was stepping out, I saw the room opposite mine was actually being cleaned up so I expected my room would also get cleaned up soon. Upon returning around 3 PM I found the room in the same state as I left it. A few minutes later when I was settled in and resting, the cleaning lady knocked and asked if I wanted the room cleaned, which I then agreed to. After their cleaning routine the 2 ladies just stepped out of the room with nary a remark to the effect that the job was done. I was surfing the net on the workdesk and had my back turned away so was surprised to find that I was alone and the ladies had in fact left. Anyway no big issue.Overall the main selling point of the Ibis Bencoolen is the location. The nearby Bugis area has a lot of dining and shopping options catering to all kinds of budgets. There is a bus station justimmediately outside the hotel where one can catch a ride towards the Orchard or Marina areas. The MRT is a 5 to 10 minute walk away and taxis are certainly plentiful albeit quite expensive nowadays.As with most Singapore hotels, breakfast usually does not offer good value. The choices were quite plentiful but options abound just outside the hotel at a much lower price. There are in fact a couple of hawker centers nearby and Sim Lim Square and Bugis Junction both have food courts. Generally I found my stay at the Ibis was quite comfortable. Certainly don't expect much of the perks you would expect to find in higher class hotels. What you ultimately pay for in the Ibis is the location. The amenities are certainly passable and functional. I would consider the Ibis again supposing I come back on a leisure trip to Singapore.""",30
IBIS_BEN,3,“convenient and economic -”,"convenient, reasonable (for Singapore) and plenty of amenities nearby.Bugis MRT (east West) and Bras Basah MRT(Circle) are within 10 minutes walk. Hotel was clean and staff helpful throughout my stay.",147
IBIS_BEN,3,“Basic”,"Stayed for two nights on way to Europe. Basic hotel, small but clean room on tenth floor. Problem with no PowerPoint close to any mirror so that electrical hair items could be used apart from the small supplied hair dryer in the bathroom. Desk staff not able to supply mirror or other solution. We paid for extra late checkout (extra half day payment to allow for 8pm departure) but needed to remind desk staff twice that the room needed to be serviced. Breakfast supplied was adequate .When all said and done would probably pay a little more next time and get a more value added hotel. Disappointing. Ps be careful with wifi in hotel. Not sure if a hacking attempt made or not but email account behaved strangely and password needed to be changed etc.. Email only functioned properly again once hotel had been departed. Very strange!",31

It is also within walking distance from the conference centre and the Marina Bay, even though the humid weather will make you sweat. Wi fi internet is free. It is a standard 3 star hotel.My room was pretty small and I didn't like the fact that there was no door in the closet. Also, the daily cleaning of the room was pretty late. More than once I returned to my room at 1.30pm and I found the room just like I left it in the morning. An other thing is that sometimes I had to wait a long time for the elevator. Overall, I thought it was pretty expensive, but then again, all hotels in Singapore are expensive.",80
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ok for couple of nights !”,"Good location and not far from Bugis Street. Centrally located although finding the right street leading to the lobby can be little challenging at times. But no worries if you are commuting in a cab. Everything is just walking distance restuarents,shopping, convenience stores, bus stop and train stop.

Left my room at 11am and told them to make up my room. However, upon returning back to the hotel at 4pm, it was still not done. I left the hotel again at around 6pm and informed the staff at the lobby to make up my room. Came back at 11pm+ and it was still not done! Went to the lobby and told them to make up the room but they wanted to charge me $20+ for it because their records have shown that they have made my room. In the end, they took almost 1 hour just to make up my room.- They only make up your room once a day, and additional make ups cost $20+.- Toiletries are not replaced daily.- Bed bugs were discovered.- Toothbrush and paste was not provided upon check in.- The hotel is quite far away from the MRT station, about 15mins walk. So you definitely need to bring an umbrella out, as there is no sheltered walkway to the station.",101
IBIS_BEN,3,“Great Location; just don't expect much”,The room was small by American standards; average by Western Europe standards; and the bed was small and hard - by any standards.I must say that it was on the cheaper end of places in the area; but at about $200 a night - I was hoping for more. The hotel and room was quiet and clean; but the breakfast was dreadful and overpriced for what you get. At least the bar had a decent happy hour and there was free wifi.LOADS of shopping is close (in several directions); easy access to the subway and lots of food choices close by.,83
IBIS_BEN,3,“Solid budget accommodation (with noisy door latches)”,I'd stay at this hotel again. It's no frills but it serves the purpose. Hotels in Singapore right now are very expensive and this is a good low-cost choice.One negative - whoever chose the door hardware for this hotel should be fired. The doors are so noisy. At about 7am the symphony of noisy door latches begins. It's a shame because one of the fundamental things about a hotel is a good night's sleep and choosing noisy door latches was a big mistake.,70

IBIS_BEN,3,"“Good Location, but the price is too high”","Just visiting this hotel last week and spent 3 nights there. In term of location, it's really good and very convenient since it's closed to Bugis MRT station (around 5 minutes walk), and Little India + China town are both within the walking distance. Additionally, there are many restaurants and food court around.The room was clean and the hotel's staffs are helpful. Internet Connection wasn't bad.However, the room size is quite small for the price. The price was as-if it's 4 stars hotel, but personally, I think this hotel is just 3 stars.",137
IBIS_BEN,3,“Not quite as good as my stay a year ago”,"I had a 7th floor Twin Room overlooking the temple on Waterloo Street, & paid SGD$175 / Aust$139 per nt. I found the bed rather firm, and the bathroom walls are in need of a good clean or re-paint (splashes, scrapes and writing on the wall under the hairdryer). There is a good choice of TV channels, the room was quiet, and they have replaced the silly mini-fridges that were there on my last stay with small bar fridges which actually keep things cold. Housekeeping staff are friendly and were prompt in servicing the room. My main problem was the slow WIFI Internet. I was able to work online very early in the morning (from 4am to 5.30am), but at all other times it was so slow I just gave up. Don't think I will stay again.",38
IBIS_BEN,3,"“hotel decent, but below Asian Standards.. would be OK if it was in Europe”","this hotel lacks in what I like in Asian hotels.. the rooms are bare minimum, the breakfast is lame and uninteresting.It is, however clean, and I did get a good night's sleep.I prefer the Novotel and Mercure Chains.",142
IBIS_BEN,3,“Manage your expectaions of value”,"In Minneapolis, MN one could get a room 1/2 again as large and with full breakfast for these prices. I booked this hotel as a first time visitor to SIN. It didn't take long for me to realize that this city is priced like Oslo or NYC not like the midwest. Room rate are signifigantly higher for all the hotels M-Th and drop on the weekends, UNLESS there is a holiday or car race! They even manage to bump up the price for Valentine's Day.Others have described the property very well herein but I would add that since it is new it is very clean. I emailed a request for a non-smoking and quiet room. I got 1435 which was both, never been smoked in. There are lots of eating options nearby but the hotel food was decent. Staff helpful and attentive.",46
IBIS_BEN,3,“Book Early”,"Book your room as early as possible because when the availability is lesser, the room rate keeps increasing until unreasonable. The free wifi is a plus. Distance to Bugis MRT station is not very near but the view of shops all the way is quite interesting.",334
IBIS_BEN,3,“Would use again”,"A good basic hotel. Stayed 2 nights at the Ibis Bencoolen and would use again. It is clean and within walking distance (5 to 10 min) of some of the bigger shopping malls eg. Raffles. The check in clerk was friendly and helpful, coming over to the info desk with us to circle out points of interest on a map and showed us where to catch public transit and the hop on/hop off bus. There is no bell boy to help with luggage but actually found this better as we are used to managing our own suitcases, the elevators are fast, fairly large and clean. The room was small but was adequate, clean and comfortable, not much space for suitcases in the closet though. There is laminate flooring and actually preferred it to the sometimes dirty carpets in other hotels we've stayed at. I did notice a few tiny ants when I wiped the desk off in the room, my own fault as I had a glass of wine while using the computer and didn't wipe the glass ring up right away. The bathroom was clean and relatively large for the size of the room but only one set of towels were set out. Found no problem with the free WiFi, they give you a password to connect and service was as quick as at home. Breakfast buffet was included both days, it had a good variety and started at 6 am which was good for us as we had airport pick up scheduled for 6:30 am. Would not recommend the bar, we had a drink during \happy hour\"" 2 for 1, the tab for two small glasses of Heiniken's $20. Did not eat in the restaurant as there are plenty of cafes and other places to eat that are more reasonable and much more interesting. We ate at the Lau Passat Market and the food market by the Singapore Flyer, both good. If you aren't a very adventurous diner, stick with vegetarian plates.""",860
IBIS_BEN,3,“A Word of Warning”,"After spending 3 glorious nights in a luxurious hotel nearby, I decided to go for a budget option for my final night, and thus Ibis on Bencoolen was the last stop on my whistle-stop tour of Singapore before heading off to Tokyo. Check-in was very efficient with some very polite and cheerful staff members. I had actually made a mistake when entering my credit card details whilst booking online, and when I informed the receptionist of this mistake I was told that it wouldn't matter as the card system is used just a reservation and payment wouldn't be taken until I checked out anyway.Upon receiving your keycard, you activate the elevator to get up to your room by swiping it against a detector on the elevator wall and press the button corresponding to which floor number you need. The elevators are fairly fast and plentiful. Although I did not use the bar or restaurant (they were closed for some reason), both looked very nice and contained a lot of seating areas adjacent to the lobby.Ibis on Bencoolen, however, does not have great rooms. Apparently, all rooms in the hotel are of the same design and standard with no choice to upgrade or pay extra for any increased comfort or amenities. Firstly, there is no carpet on the floor of your room. For some people, this may not be a problem, but this is a 3* hotel for which I paid over £100 for a room for just one night, so cold, wooden panelled floors are not acceptable, especially not in Singapore, where plenty of other hotels of the same class, not only offer carpet in their rooms, but also offer other services such as room service, which Ibis on Bencoolen does not.Aside from the lack of carpet, Ibis on Bencoolen also has issues with its Internet service. The service is free, and it is WIFI, but it is very awkward to connect to this Internet and requires not only a code to be found on paperwork in the room itself, but also requests you to change your homepage and some other settings on your system before it can connect. I find this unacceptable and totally unnecessary. The WIFI speed was adequate, but nothing special. I have stayed in Ibis hotels in Seoul and Jakarta, and both had faster WIFI service than this hotel. It must be said also that my laptop appeared slow and suspiciously out of kilter to what I had been used to, even once disconnecting from the Internet upon checking out the following morning.That said, my experience was not all bad. I found the room to have very good artificial light which was good for reading and staying up to watch the television. Additionally, there was a fairly good selection of programming available from around the world. The picture quality was clear and consistent. What I liked about it, was a detailed panphlet informing me of what type of programs were on each channel. There were tea-making facilities in the room too, including a kettle, 2 mugs, and some Nescafe-branded coffee. An in-room safe is also provided, as well as coat hangers, and some extra blankets. In the bathroom, there were complimentary soaps and bodywash available.However, to end on a bad note, my room had a rather annoying infestation of ants. I realise Singapore is in the tropics and that ants are attracted to food, but this is a hotel room and I had only just arrived. Yet my bin in the room was filled with at least a dozen ants, despite the bin being empty. I also had ants crawl over my desk whilst I was online, which was rather annoying.Ibis are a great hotel brand. For their budget prices, you could effectively travel all over Asia and stay at their hotels. Properties in Bangkok, Phuket, Koh Samui, Shanghai, Seoul, Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta are among the best value in their regions. Of course, it is not a luxury brand, and usually you get what you pay for (that being, if you pay a value price for a room, you get less than if you pay a high price for the room). Yet this is where management let themselves down with Ibis on Bencoolen. This is Singapore, it can never be cheap, but regardless of this economic fact, Ibis must strive to offer good value for money, as they do with sister hotels worldwide. So for £100 per night (at the time of my stay in October), management need to offer more than hotels that charge less, and this simply doesn't happen at Ibis on Bencoolen.So just make sure you know what you paying for when booking here. Unless special cheaper rates apply, then it may be worth your time and effort looking at another hotel in the same price range, even another Accor Group hotel such as the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel, which has standard rates almost identical to Ibis on Bencoolen - and it has carpet in the rooms, and it offers 24hr room service! I will be staying there next time I am in Singapore and require a budget hotel for a few nights.",43
IBIS_BEN,3,“good hotel”,hotel is clean and according the usual IBIS hotel standard.the location is good. Quick and efficient check-in. room is clean. the bathroom is little small. I do recommend to provide mineral water in the room. I will stay again on my next trip.,174
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Good hotel, terrible web service”","The hotel was clean and staff was friendly. I went during the F1 weekend and had a great time. The location is very good for the price and the online booking was very easy. Unfortunately, one day they were very late to clean my room. It wasn't cleaned until after 4pm. Otherwise, I recommend this hotel itself.While the experience of the hotel was good, the after experience has been and continues to be terrible. I was signed up to their newsletter via their membership system although I never explicitly said I wanted it or not. I then proceeded to stop the countless e-mails and newsletters they sent me. I unsubscribed from ALL newsletters and yet I continued to get e-mails every couple of days. I then proceeded to e-mail them. I was told to e-mail someone else and it wasn't their problem. I e-mailed another address and had no reply. I still get e-mails. There is no method on their website to help. If asked for an e-mail address, always avoid it if possible.",73
IBIS_BEN,3,“Functional hotel - wifi in room but no pool”,"A good functional hotel for a short-stay in singapore. About 10 min walk to the closest train station.Wi-fi in rooms is great, so are the beds, however the rooms can be noisy, with noise quite loud from the hallway.This hotel doesn't have a pool either which would be a big benefit in singapore.All in all it was an affordable option to stay at for a few days but i probably wouldn't stay again.",41

IBIS_BEN,1,"“Ibis Bencoolen -- Bad service, lousy beds, not for business travellers”","Being a business traveller, especially in Asia, I believe readers should understand I've seen the highs and lows of hotel standards in Singapore and across the region. I expect nothing more than polite and straight forward service in hotels, no need the First Class service of Singapore Airlines or other international airlines.This was a last-minute business trip, what with the upcoming Chinese New Year, there were no rooms in my usual hotels. So, Ibis Bencoolen was the best for last minute booking.First off, the service standard is surprisingly bad. My friend drove me from Changi airport to the hotel. When we found the entrance to drop me off, he decided to park and check out the hotel as he's never been in the hotel either. When we arrived, we scouted for a few minutes for empty bays. We saw a few beside the main entrance of the hotel, and decided to park in one. As we were taking out my luggage from his boot, a 'guard' came out and told my friend to move his car because he had parked in bays reserved for taxis. Understand that there were no sign ages that indicated this. He then stood there intently watching my friend move his car. No porter, no service and certainly full of attitude!Second, I am a smoker. But there were no smoking rooms available when I booked. So I checked into a non-smoking room. After checking in, and having left my luggage in the room, I walked around this small hotel. I notice there were no-smoking signs in the lobby. So, I asked at the reception, if there were smoking areas anywhere in the hotel, other than the allocated smoking rooms? The reception told me to stand outside the hotel to smoke.I thought she must have misunderstood me, so I asked again and she said the same thing! Well, well, Ibis must be doing extremely to treat guests this badly.Finally, the rooms are casually designed (not a bad thing in itself), ergonomics, lighting and all that of the rooms are acceptable. But, the beds are more futons than beds (y'know the ones with springs or cushion).It seems Ibis Bencoolen is for back-packers, people on budget who expect horrible and unhelpful staff as part of their 'adventure'. Unfortunately for me, I am not back-packing and I still have to stay here for the rest of the week (I'm writing this as I cannot sleep at the moment, on my first night here).Ironically, I'm setting up office in the region and am scouting hotels for when my staff travels to Singapore. Ibis Bencoolen certainly will not qualify even as a basic hotel for short business trips.",52
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average”,"No drinking water in bottles provided in the room. Other smaller hotel still provides that. However, the room has enough space, if you're travelling with 2kids. The Guest Laundry room also helps, as you don't have to bring too much clothes if you stay here.Overal benefits compare to the price is average.",49
IBIS_BEN,3,“Pleasant and helpful staff”,Reception staff very helpful - especially a gentleman named Sunny. Room is small but adequate for what we wanted - a quick stopover. Grateful that they accomodated us for early check in - straight from early morning flight. Linen - bed sheet was however dirty. Restaurant also no complaints.,163
IBIS_BEN,3,“Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen”,"I traveled to Singapore with friends in June and our pockets were a little tight so Hotel Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen came to the rescue. Being a Budget-Hotel it provided us cheap rooms for a make-do sort of comfortable stay. Hotel Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is ideally located among Singapore’s most significant landmarks. Located on the city’s museum belt, The Hotel 81 Bencoolen is between a 5-10 minute walk to the National Museum, the National art Museum, and the Esplenade. Guests are also within walking distance of the shopping hub of Orchard Road, as well as Bugis Junction and Marina Square. It is also close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, which is the biggest MRT station in Singapore. There are many food courts and inexpensive dining options surrounding the building, which is one of the many reasons the area is popular with the backpacking community.When slightly low on money, Hotel Ibis Singapore on bencoolen , the budget hotel can provide you a comfortable stay.",133
IBIS_BEN,1,“unfriendly staff and very small rooms”,"the hotel staff is very unhelpful and not understanding. after profusely apologizing for arriving late on the day of arrival, e.g. book on the 25 and arrive at 26th morning, i was forced to pay for the night of 25th on which i did not manage to stay. i have also explain that my flight was delayed and cancellation was not possible since i took a 12 hour flight. it would have been better if they charge me simply on the 26th onwards and simply cancel the 25th charges. because of this, i am terribly discouraged to stay at the hotel after knowing that their charges are incredibly irrational (changing from one day to another)in the end , i decided to visit another cheaper and better hotel just down the road.good for me.",393

We did not see the mini-bar (which is very useful, if we buy milk, some soft drink from outside.) and felt something strange at that time. However, we saw it on our second day. We stayed at the hotel 3 nights.Just some amenities, but has hair dryer, free Internet Wi-Fi in the room and free Internet for room guests (you have to give your email address to use it). There is (pay self-laundry) and free self-Ironing (Iron and Iron board) at the 3rd Floor. It is really good for some travelers. The hotel location is very good. It is near 7-11 chain store, Bugis food junction, Bugis MRT station and busy business district. We went to Marina convention center to attend Exhibition from the hotel. We are 4 persons and we decided to take taxi instead of going by bus or by MRT. So, we took taxi every morning to there from the hotel.

IBIS_BEN,3,"“Comfortable hotel, good location; try to get a special price”","We ended up at this hotel via a \Name Your Price\"" bid on Priceline. We needed a place to crash for 3 nights in Singapore en route from Japan to Kathmandu, and this fit the bill nicely.The location was handy for its super-convenient access to a hawker centre, where we ate pretty well for $2-3 USD/meal. We mostly ran errands, buying silk from nearby Arab street and finding a good tailor in the upper floor of the hawker centre. Lots of shopping malls and low-end shopping centers nearby, and it's a short walk to Bugis MRT. This is not the modern/glitzy side of Singapore, so if you're after tall buildings and modernity, probably best to pick a different neighborhood. For us, the location worked out well.Singapore hotels, at least for our weekend, were uniformly expensive, which led us to Priceline. We ended up paying $110 USD, which was only a slight discount, and feels expensive in retrospect, but other hotels were charging much more.We wouldn't go out of our way to return, but our stay was perfectly pleasant and fine: no problem with Internet speed that I can recall, and we could print a few pages in the lobby free of charge. Room was a fine size: our high floor room had a huge bed and the flatscreen TV was plenty big (though we didn't watch it). The in-room tea was nice, just basic black and green I believe. Bathroom fine, nothing noteworthy. Everything was clean and tidy, and we were quite content, as we weren't expecting anything fancy from the Ibis.Basically, if you're not expecting luxury, I think you'll be perfectly satisfied, but unless the Bencoolen/Bugis location is your main goal, or unless you get a particularly good deal on the rate (e.g. priceline), it's not an obvious \""must stay\"" hotel to me.""",55
IBIS_BEN,3,“Expensive”,I have stayed couple of nights in this hotel while I was in Singapore. its the best location to stay as it is very close to the shopping area but I felt i have paid too much to stayed in a serviced apartment. should have stayed near Orchard road and paid similar amount. Never again,295
IBIS_BEN,2,“Over rated”,The reviews of this hotel that I read vastly over rate it. It is a basic 2 star product although its lack of facilities was somewhat tempered by the friendly and helpful staff.The rooms are very small; the 'colonial wooden floors' were some cheap product from B&Q. Tiny flat screen TV with limited cable channels. The room was clean and the bed comfortable if hard. There was no fridge or minibar and the only glasses (2) were by the sink in the bathroom. There was no mineral water provided although a note said the tap water was drinkable. Unless they have their own treatment facility (not recorded) most other hotels in Singapore would disagree with them. I was on one of the highest floors but there is still no view worthy of the name.The bathroom was smaller still with one tiny bar of soap to share between the sink and the shower (no bath). There was a dispenser in the shower with shampoo or shower gel.The corridors to the bedrooms were institutional.The entrance lobby merges into a bar (with a 2 for 1 happy hour) and an all day restaurant. Reminiscent of a not very good airport lounge. It was clear that the hotel caters to a large number of tour groups. There were a couple of computers as well for the use of guests without their ownThe internet in the room was free (a big plus) but slow.Having no swimming pool or outside area and no gym were major defects.The location is relatively convenient and Bugis Junction MTR was a short walk and there were almost always taxis waiting outside the hotel.There are far superior choices in Singapore with far better equipped rooms and more facilities available at or around the rates charged here.,45
IBIS_BEN,3,“1N Hotel Stay in Singapore”,The space was relatively small as compared to the ones at Carlton Hotel and Hotel Rendezvous. There was no fridge in the room and swimming pool. Scenery not good as we could see the rooftop of the neighboring buildings. We were staying at Level 9.,58
IBIS_BEN,3,“Poor Service”,Poor service - checked in at Express Accor Advantage Plus/A-Club member counter. Left standing at counter for a few minutes and I have to tell the staff on duty that we have been waiting for service while they stand chatting among themselves!! No bar fridge in the room - bad!!No service with luggages to and from the room.,45
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Good location, busy hotel”","The room I stayed in was small but had all the necessities. The hotel seemed very busy. The breakfast seemed overpriced for the selection of food, and the restaurant was very busy. There are cheaper eating options nearby such as food courts, restaurants, cafes, etc.",38
IBIS_BEN,3,“Lift and check in counter”,Lift speed is slow and it has resulted long waiting during peak hours.Check in counter is not sufficient during peak check in and check out time.should seperate the laggugade handling counter with check in and check out counter.,43
IBIS_BEN,3,“Convenient”,"We were offered this hotel as a stopover by Singapore Airlines en route to Europe. The room was clean and quiet, the bed and pillows comfortable, and the bathroom small but satisfactory. The breakfast was excellent but note there is no swimming pool.",142
IBIS_BEN,3,"“It did the job, but nothing special”","The lobby of the Ibis was so busy all the time. The staff were all polite, but the lobby area is actually too small to handle the traffic.The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was tiny, but it had everything it needed. I just felt a little like I was in a cubby house. We had a family staying in some rooms on our floor and they would wake up very early and have loud conversations in the hallway and let their children play in the hallway. The rooms were not very soundproof from this.The location was fine. There's a good hawker centre right near the hotel. Shops are all around and the MRT is only a couple of blocks away. Overall, it was fine, not sure that I'd stay again, but it certainly served its purpose.",29
IBIS_BEN,3,“Clean and efficient but little character”,The Bencoolen Ibis is a convenient and clean hotel with efficient service and in a central location. It is a typical Ibis in that it lacks a little character.,178
IBIS_BEN,2,“not worth the saving”,"i stayed for 4 nights in this hotel in oct. 2011, with my husband and my 2 years old son. hotel was chosen according to its trip advisor's reviews in comparision to its cost, well, it was not worth the saving , as with a little more money i could have a much btr options in singapore.. the positives: good wifi connection... nothing morethe negatives: ubon arrival we wasnt welcomed by anyone of the stuff, and we had to carry our lauggage upstairs after a long time for check-in process, room was litterally lacking any complimentary stuff that you would take for granted in other hotels, basic things are missing , like refrigirators!! i called reception and they said i can keep my baby milk in the resturant fridge downstairs!! we are in 2011 or am mistaken! they said they took all fridges for maintainance for whole october :) guess they are rebuilding them.A/C have to be set to max. coolness to make room just acceptable.no ironing setno swimming poollocation : 10 minutes walk from bugis MTR station",116
IBIS_BEN,3,“You get what you pay for”,"We were told that the Ibis Bencoolen was a 3 *** hotel but were disappointed in size of room and lack of swimming pool. The Wifi was very handy.Food was, I'd say, excellent, whether for breakfast or a la carte in the evening. One problem we found was the translation of \2 drinks for one\"" Not so.I was disappointed that a small trinket that I misplaced in our room was never found, and that mail placed in the receptacle at the front desk was not mailed until TEN days later!!NOT GOOD Ibis!!Very handy to Bugis and Orchard street and various temples; Taxi fares very moderate. But I would not make a second booking to stay there""",48
IBIS_BEN,3,“Not Worth it - Highly over rated”,"The hotel is very professionally manged and well know for the no nonsense business traveler, with No-frills attached offering. But. Singapore has better hotels in terms of everything, i recommend Hotel Park Regis , on Merchant Road. Its a new hotel, great service, good rooms , awesome staff.",166
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Great position for shopping or getting round, but basic hotel”","The position of hotel was excellent as walking distance to the good shopping districts and a lot of sights and easy access to transport. Rooms were very small but clean, though lacking in extras you take for granted in most places. Biggest disappointment for me was no pool, which would have been nice, and expected in a hotel in the tropics. No mini fridge and impossible to get ice, but wi-fi in rooms good, even with my ipad. Service ok but language bit of a problem at times. Am told it is a very good price for Singapore hotels, but would rather pay a bit extra for somewhere with a pool and a bigger room. Do NOT post your mail at the hotel, as their letter box is only emptied about once a fortnight - mail I put in it the night I arrived, arrived back in Australia well after I did, and was postmarked 8 days after it was put in their courtesy letter box.",108
IBIS_BEN,3,“Comfortable and convenient”,"This hotel is a clean and comfortable basic hotel close to central Singapore. The staff are really helpful we arrived after a hideous night flight from Rome at 07.30 even though check in is officially 14.00 they found a room for us. Rooms are basic, good air conditioning (essential in Singapore) no fridge in room, comfortable bed. There is a great Thai restaurant across the road Lemon 3 Thai plenty of others in the area as well as great food markets. Be warned if you like wine expect to pay 4 times as much in Singapore. If we overnight next time we might bring a bottle or two?",86
IBIS_BEN,3,“Comfortable & clean”,"This was my first private visit to singapore, having always gone there for business only and stayed at hotels booked by the company. the ibis may not have the luxury of those hotels, but the bed was comfortable, the room & bathroom clean and the service excellent. front desk, restaurant staff, bell boy. all of them were really helpful. there had been a minor glitch, but management took care of it immediately. would most definitely stay here again when next in singapore for a few days.",126
IBIS_BEN,3,“Comfortable basic Ibis hotel”,"This was a basic hotel, the standard I have come to expect of IBIS. The location was good, and there was not much of a wait for taxis in the morning. This is a problem at other hotels I have stayed at in Singapore.The breakfast was good, however the coffees from the espresso machine were not. I susopect they use some sort of UHT milk, which leaves a funny taste.There was no light inside the bathroom.As with all IBIS hotels I have stayed in, the beds are FIRM.We ate out 2 nights in a laneway off the mall just south of the IBIS Bencoolen, this laneway is opposite the Sri Krishnan temple. The food was the traditional hawker style food, we were the only tourists there.",45
IBIS_BEN,3,“Could have been any where”,"Stock standard Small Room. (Very Small)Was clean and bright. Good for an overnight but NOT a long term holiday.The restaurant looked good, but didn't try due to highly overrated prices.Comfortable but firm bed, stock standard in Asia, only 1 flat pillow.Staff were efficient and friendly.",54
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good place to stay with smart value”,I like the hotel because it's located near Bugis and La Salle CollegeOn the back of the hotel we can find local chinese markets and canteens which offers various food with reasonable prices.The price for room is reasonable and the hotel had a basic accomodation onlyThe check in and check out procedure are simple,58
IBIS_BEN,3,“Decent but overpriced 3 star hotel”,"The very basic rooms are clean and well maintained. Staff is friendly and helpful. The free internet is good. Price is steep and too high for such a basic room in a hotel without amenities, even in Singapore. Breakfast is expensive and mediocre, it is better to grab some local noodles in a nearby foodcourt or hawker centre.",46
IBIS_BEN,3,“Disappointed but will return hoping for improvement”,"Usual Ibis cleanliness standards not met, specially shower stall.Breakfast buffet quality declining. (27/08/2011) Bar service appalling. Happy hour 26/8/2011: waited for bartender to appear, after 15 minutes, decided to walk to 7-11 next door t buy my own beer. Cheaper for me, lost revenue for hotel.",62
IBIS_BEN,3,“Value for money Hotel”,"Located on Bencoolen Street and is a fair way out of the central area of Singapore, but as Singapore is so small it is not a massive factor! Plus if you can get a good rate, you will find it very hard to justify paying more to stay elsewhere. The Ibis Hotel on Bencoolen street offers fantastic value for money and quality!",44
IBIS_BEN,3,“tiny standard room”,I stayed in this hotel with my wife and 1 yo baby. The room was not like I had when I stayed in the Accord hotels in Jakarta which is bigger and more comfort. However the receptionist was very kind and nice to us.,37
IBIS_BEN,3,“Clean and cool”,We stayed here for two nights in transit from Australia to London. The staff were helpful at every opportunity and the hotel was clean and reasonably comfortable. Breakfast catered to a range of tastes and was plentiful.,191
IBIS_BEN,2,“Staying at Ibis was staying in a better Motel”,"Himy stay at Ibis was pretty dissastisfying.In terms of faacilities and services it was very compromised1. it was late in the night I couldnt get an iron in my room to iron my clothes; the clothes could be sent to iron only after 830AM the following day (which was beyond the time i was suppose to leave for my meeting)2. i couldnt order any food in the room3. There were hardly any toiletories in the room4. I used the soap (for hadn wash) and kept it in the shower; in 4 nights you didnt replish the tiny soap.5. The breakfast was just bouffet only, so couldnt order anything if i was late for breakfast.6. The room was so small that , i was reminded of rooms in Tokyo. I have stayed in much bigger rooms in Singapore for that price till lately.7. there was just one power plug in the room next to the desk.8. Not even a bottle of water / juice or any food or drink in the room; i had to rely on 7 eleven.9. In all the energy level in the surrounding (not the employyes) was low",50
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good Location but hard to get a taxi”,"The location is good but it takes a longtime to get a taxi. The bathroom too small. The TV channel is limited. The good things is there is a free wireless internet in the room. The wardrope also too small. The toilet should have a water spayer, especially for Indonesian.",39
IBIS_BEN,3,“Satisft”,"I satisfied with this hotel with the level of money. The food in the restaurant inside is ok and at good price, very convenient. I like the design of room, nice and convenient. Always have hot water for shower.",65
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good location and comfortable stay”,I stayed at Ibis for 3 night on business. It was a good central location. Rooms were small but comfortable. Staff was very helpful with getting taxis and providing clear written directions for train and bus transport. 7-11 right next door is convenient for getting any items you may need. Many good casual restaurants nearby and and nice restaurant district about 10 minute walk away.,56
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good hotel for short stay”,"Reasonable price., the size of the room is appropriate, but not for two big people o r 2 adults and a child. Bathroom is ok, clean and nice towels, 10 minutes walk to the nearest metro station. Quiet district, taxi stop at the hotel entrance. Transfer from airport to the hotel by taxi costs 20 SGD.",54
IBIS_BEN,3,“Minimum standard for business”,"good location too little for a business traveller, too expensive Singapore does not give you an excellent price/quality ratio as it used to give until few years ago.Unfortunately there are not so many alternatives unless you know somebody who can give you some information on smaller hotels that do not belong to international chains",45
IBIS_BEN,3,“Personal rate”,Ibis Bencoolen is suitable for business due to the location is very close to business area. If positioning of the hotel for leisure purpose should be equipped by nice pool and others activity to make the quests prefer to stay rather than go any where.,83
IBIS_BEN,3,“Overall Good & Improved”,"The first stay we had with Ibis was October last year.Other than the room being small, overall facilities met our expectations (with the price of the hotel) as my first priority would be cleanliness. The room would be good to accomodate not more than 3 person (2adults1child).Hotel staff services has improved compared to our first stay especially the front desk and service counter which made our recent stay satisfying & a happy one.Would like to say thank you and appreciate their friendly service.",43
IBIS_BEN,2,“busines in spore”,"Nice position in Bugis, but Too far from MRT if you have luggage.There is no Gym facility to spend some time, this can be not good if you travel alone.Hotel emplyes are very friendly, and help you a lot.Very Good the free internet..",105
IBIS_BEN,2,“Poor service”,Booked on Accor site as a card holder. Tiny rooms but OK if you are backpacking. Front desk service hopeless. Booked at one rate but found on checkout that it was S£68 MORE per night than agreed. Not having the printout of the booking I could not prove. On asking for manager - none available! Asked for address of GM but was given Front of House manager who has no authority. Utterly hopeless. Have written to GM in Singapore and await response - not hopeful. NEVER again in Singapore. What a contrast to the new IBIS in Bangkok with cheerful willing staff adn decent rooms.,54
IBIS_BEN,3,“area around the hotel is great but room is too small & bit too expensive”,"location of the hotel is great. Walk behind the hotel u have lots of cheap eateries shop, little further, there's shopping market & also the bugis shopping mall. MTR is about 7 mins walk, so it's pretty close. The room is very small & also the bed is a bit hard to sleep on.",137
IBIS_BEN,3,"“OK hotel, rooms let you down”","I stayed for 2 nights at the hotel, and all in all it is a good place to stay. It is centrally located and Singapore being so small and the hotel being located at the center ensures that you are not too far away from any major landmark. Service is good, pleasant staff, willing to help. Food is OK, we took the all incl package. What really lets down the hotel are the rooms. I know space is a premium in Singapore, but you will feel that the rooms are on the smaller side and gives you a cramped feeling - especially by American standards.If you are not too bothered about the size of the room and if you are only planning to use the room for your night sleep, then this hotel is a good option.",82
IBIS_BEN,3,“Small Rooms felt more like a budget hotel”,"The location is descent, but its a 15 min walk to the MRT. Long lines for taxi's generally as well from the hotel, with many guys refusing to drive unless you were going a long distance from the hotel. The room were cramped in my opinion and small. The hotel overall is fine just I was a bit disappointed for the 200SGD they were charging for the room. I felt that was more than it should have been for what they offered.",74
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Small Room, But for the price and location would stay again.”","Ibis Hotel singapore is like any other Ibis I have stayed at. Clean, Small, Tidy, good location and cheap. Can not find any cheaper around the location. Breakfast is very good and the meals in the restaurant on the ground floor is great. I only stayed for 2 nights and would recommend for solo or couples but not for families (Rooms are too small) and there is not swimming pool or spa or gym.",52
IBIS_BEN,3,"“NO OFFER FOR SERVICES IN HOTEL (RESTAURANT, BAR)”","I've hold Advantage Plus Card for a year. But I think the priviledge service I got doesn't the same as I expect. Since we check in at the front desk, the staff doesn't offer us to visit the restaurant. They were rushing time when served us. Hope next time all services better.",458
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Very clean but tiny, noisy”","Hotels in Singapore are qutie expensive in general, so we were trying to find a hotel that was not too expensive (under $150 US dollars) but also clean and basic. The Ibis on Bencoolen was quite clean. I had no complaints as far as cleanliness. However, if you are a late riser and like to sleep a lot in the mornings, it is not possible. Each morning around 8 or 9 a.m. and on, the sound of people chatting in the halls, mostly the cleaning staff I believe, was very loud. The accoustics of that hallway aren't very good and you can hear everything. Also the rooms are tiny. The bed was fine, everything was nice and clean but cramped. The bathroom especially is quite small. Also the toiletries provided are very limited - shampoo and soap. No lotion (bring your own) and no conditioner. They have a hair dryer but you have to keep your finger pressed down on the on button the entire time. When you have a lot of long hair, like myself, your thumb can get a cramp. The button is in a very uncomfortable place. Also the only electric plug available in the bathroom is only meant for a men's shaver. So if you want to straight iron your hair or use a curling iron, you have to go by the window and do it. They do provide a tiny refrigerator in the room, good for maybe 2 cans of soda or beer, and the floor is hardwood. Air conditioning worked very well. As with many places in Singapore, it can take a long time to get a taxi. In Singapore it's not easy to get a taxi by hailing one off the street. In most cases they aren't supposed to stop b/c it is dangerous or it blocks traffic. Very different from most big cities. Ibis has a taxi stand and it can take up to 15 min. to get a taxi some times but it can take a really long time as there are long queues in many popular areas of the city (such as Orchard Rd. or tourist attractions). Ibis has some cheap eateries nearby for local food and is not far from little India. The neighborhood is fine, I felt completely safe. Checking in and checking out did not take a long time. The room we chose did not have a good view. If we had to do it over again and in hindsight, I think we might've chosen to stay at a slightly nicer place while paying more per night, although overall Singapore hotel prices are very expensive. Also there is no gym. There are vending machines on each floor and the tap water is safe to drink.",56
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average”,"Stayed here for one night on our way back to UK from Bali.We had stayed for 3 nights at the Residence at Singapore Recreation Club(which was brilliant!) on our outwardjourney so the Ibis was disappointing in comparison. Our room was very small (on 10th floor). The staff were very helpfull, and breakfast was included (good quality)",42
IBIS_BEN,3,“Small boutique style hotel”,IBIS Bencoolen room size is very small. Room is clean and bed is comfortable. Wi-fi is good. recommended if you get a good rate below 200 SGD including taxes. the rate is displayed outside hotel and changes everyday as per the demand.,201
IBIS_BEN,3,“Average Accom but Good Location”,"My partner and I were looking for somewhere in the city and clean for 2 nights. This hotel ticked those boxes for us. When we arrived we discovered that the hotel had misinterpreted our booking form and booked 2 rooms for us as I had stated both names on the form. No cancellation fee was charged for this error though. Location was good with a bus stop right out the front of the hotel travelling to all major locations. It was about a 10 min walk to the closest major train station. The rooms were small and the big bed dominated the room. The bed in our room was very hard, much like sleeping on a plank of wood unfortunately. The in room fridge was not very cold and could only just fit 2 small bottles of water in it. We included buffet breakfast which had a standard selection of foods, cereals, hot breakfast, fruit etc. but was very nice. We ate dinner one night at the hotel restaurant, menu was local tapas style food. Food was great and melted in your mouth.Overall this hotel ticked our boxes however due to the bed we probably would not consider staying here again.",128
IBIS_BEN,3,“A place for sleep”,"I stayed at Ibis Bencoolen with other 2 friends there for 2 nights. My friend booked to stay there as she is a member of Accor,though the price was little bit expensive. They offer free internet in guest room also at the lobby.The location of this hotel is near Bugis station; about 10 minutes walk.There is convenient store that open 24 hrs nearby.Three of us stayed in a room without extra charge.There was no extra bed as the room was small, so I put two bed together.Small bathroom but got all necessary amenities.Overall, I am satisfied with the stay.I did not use that much facilities at the hotel as I got up early in the morning for city tour and back to the hotel very late at night.",178
IBIS_BEN,3,“Not so budget prices for Budget Hotel”,"Ibis is supposed to be a budget chain. However in Singapore, the Ibis is not very much cheaper than the 5 star hotels. In Europe, Ibis can be less than 50% the price of a 5 star hotel. In Singapore it is only about 30% cheaper. If you are willing to pay 30% more, you can 100% better quality. This makes me wonder why there are so many European travellers at this hotel. They are probably unaware of this. The hotel is located at a central location but at a quieter street. You can walk to an underground train station or find plenty of shops and restaurant at a place called Bugis Junction.Room is clean but very small. Bathroom is small. Yes. This is a budget hotel. Nothing more, nothing less.Breakfast has a bit of a canteen feel but the food is OK. Some items run out pretty quick if you go later in the morning.My conclusion. Pay a little more and you can stay at a 5 star hotel. Ibis is not a value hotel in Singapore.",38
IBIS_BEN,3,“.?”,Overall I satisfied your hotel but room is quite small and price is reasonable but still high for our money. Your staff is good. Location not far from business area. What I like the most is city tour,43
IBIS_BEN,3,“Need more shelf”,"Not enough shelf to put belongings such as cloths & toiletries also should have a jet sprayer in the toilet because Indonesian need water in the toilet bowl. Location is a very plus point for the hotel, it is convinience to go anywhere",112
IBIS_BEN,3,“Room is TIDY but nice bed”,"We are regulary go to Singapore and had stayed at Ibis at Bencoolen during our 8 days visiting Singapore this time. The hotel is new but the room is extraordinary small. There was no fridge in the room only a picnic fridge and can fit only 2 very small bottles of water. There are no wardrope, only clothes rack at the end of bed. The bathroom are also small and without bathtub (considered to the another hotels in the same price are much more bigger and have ones) Though the staffs are very nice and helpful but we are staying somewhere else beside Ibis at Bencoolen for the next trip to Singapore.",48
IBIS_BEN,3,“Just ok”,"The hotel was clean and tidy, but the rooms were extremely small. The bar fridge was useless. There was no bath,, and to my surprise not even a hotel swimming pool.It was far too expensive for what we got.the staff were pleasant friendly and helpful at all times.",38
IBIS_BEN,3,“Decent hotel but pretty small rooms and not too many amenities”,"I stayed at the Ibis in the last week of September. The rooms are pretty small. Pretty close to the CBD. Service is alright, not that great. Most of the basic amenities are either chargeable or not available",151
IBIS_BEN,3,"“good hotel, good location, a bit expensive for its value”","Room is rather spacious for Singaporean standards. Everything is well functioning and very clean. Don't expect elegant decorations or a sense of charm here though. Location is good, next to Bugis market, where you can find foods and bargain shopping. About 15 minutes of walking to the train station. Convenient stores and food courts are plenty around the hotel. Breakfast is excellent but pricey. Staff at the checking counter is rather unfriendly, with manner similar to clerks at a fastfood store; the lobby is always crowded, small, and rather chaotic. I paid about 150USD/ day for a standard room WITHOUT breakfast (paid for a breakfast separately later just to try it, but you can always have your breakfast outside of the hotel for much better value). I would find another hotel if I needed to stay in Singapore for longer. For a short business trip, this is an OK choice. .",235
IBIS_BEN,3,“Overall good”,"I travel to Singapore every one or two months cause I bought lots of expensive spa package when I was working in Singapore. I need to use them up gradually.. I am extremely familiar with Singapore cause I had stayed in this country for about 10 years.. I just want to find a good value for money hotel for a short stay...But it is really difficult to find because all the hotels with a reasonable standard are VERY EXPENSIVE... I wonder why!!! Because for sightseeing, Singapore is not very attractive compared with other neighbour countries such as Malaysia, but the hotel rates of same star ranking could be triple..This time I choose Ibis, still relatively expensive in terms of the 3 star ratings, costs me USD173 per night with no breakfast..but the Ibis brand is reliable..The hotel is located opposite the Nanyang School of Fine Art, about 10 min walk from Bugis MRT. It is cleverly designed with no frills hotel essentials. The room is clean, spacious and adequately lighted. The hotel offers good security as my key card automatically expired after the checkout time at 12pm so I was blocked from going up to my 15th floor room in the lift...however, complimentary wifi is very very unstable and slow..wasting my travel time to get connected and surfing internet via my ipad....Anyway, all in all, I enjoyed my stay and slept well in the hotel.",534
IBIS_BEN,2,“Seriously overpriced”,"I wasn't overly impressed with the Ibis SIngapore. I found it bland, over priced and not very personal. In all honesty a bit like Singapore itself. But I will keep my review focused on the hotel and not the city. We stayed on the fifth floor with a room that was supposedly big enough for a Queen sized bed. The bed certainly wasn't Queen sized, by my standards. And given the room size itself, an official Queen sized bed couldn't have fitted in it.There was limited storage, an open plan locker type wardrobe affair, fitted into the walls, built with cheaply coated MDF, which incidentally couldn't house a 75 litre backpack, stood up. So, you would certainly struggle with anything bigger than a handbag. There was a safe and a fridge, but the fridge struggled to house a can of coke and it certainly didn't chill anything left in it. There was a LAN connection which repeatedly needed refreshing by the ISP IT help desk. And there was wifi also available. However, this too suffered from constant lock downs and failures. The TV selection was OK, but the signal kept jumping and skipping, I don't think there was a movie channel, but at least you had Discovery to keep you entertained and a few news channels. The bathroom was pokey to say the least and not big enough to swing a cat in. All fittings were moulded into the walls, it almost felt like a porta-loo. There were signs everywhere crowing on about saving the planet, keeping your shower to a maximum of four minutes etc. They came across as bogus and hinted at me, that the hotel wanted to save money by not providing clean linens daily, suggesting that they planted a tree every time someone uses a towel over two days. I'd like to see proof of this Accor Hotels...Housekeeping had to be asked to clean our room on day one, they simply missed us out? There were no comp bottles of water, albeit the tap water was apparently safe to drink. And the restaurant prices were exuberant to say the least. They also served us the wrong dish on our first night. Granted they deducted the bill by 25%, but I later discovered that this was offered to all guests. We never got an apology and were almost made to feel like we were wrong about the mistake made. How does one get confused over the difference between beef and prawns? There was a vending machine at the end of our landing, and to be honest it was fairly priced, given the prices the 7/11 charged next door. But it was cans of soda only This simply felt like the McDonalds of hotels, cheap looking, cheap feeling, cheap everything, except for the nightly price.Another thing as well, it may be best to walk in and book rather than prebook, their rates differ daily, based on occupancy. So, you may get a good deal if you are walking by. Although, this can also work out of favour. In a nutshell, I was seriously disappointed with this hotel. You know what they say about polishing a turd, it will always be a turd.",158
IBIS_BEN,3,“budget hotel. dont expect much”,"Well, Im not that big. but this room is seriously small, but thats ibis, ibis room is always small. for the price they're giving its not cheap. its like 15mins walking to reach the mrt, and you need to walk around the bugis market first before you reach the mrt. which is tiring. no bellboy, my luggage was so heavy, and the carpet on the lobby making it heavier to drag it. so, I reach at 12, room was not ready, I just seriously wonder if the hotel was full, or the reception lady just trying to be annoying. so I need to wait till 2.30pm. I was so tired, dehydrated and I need to wait for 2.30hour. so I decide to walk to bugis mall for lunch, and its not a good idea. youre tired, dehydrated, the temperature was so hot, and hungry. well, this is kinda of a budget hotel. but I wont staying here anymore.",48
IBIS_BEN,3,“Spartan with tiny rooms”,The location is good but didn't make up for the small room size. Amenities are few and far between. No room service or ice machine. To get ice I had to go to the lobby bar and wait while they found a plastic bag to carry it in.,330
IBIS_BEN,3,“Just your average 2 -3 star hotel”,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 days/3nights. Overall, it was just okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing flagrant to write home about.I will say that I would not stay here again during future trips to Singapore. Although the hotel is clean and modern, the size of the rooms were extremely small even by Asian hotel standards. You could hardly walk once you and your travel companion and suitcases are inside the room. I had to literally climb over my travel companion’s bed to get to the restroom, because her suitcase was in the pathway because she couldn’t move it anywhere else because there was no more room.The bathroom toiletries consisted of one little soap (I’m assuming this was handsoap that “doubles” as bath soap), one sanitary trash bag, and shampoo. The vanity could hold, at the most, one toiletry bag (we had to stack ours atop each other’s).As for the beds, they were made for slender and petite people. I’m on the petite side, and when I’d turn over during the night, I’d find that my elbow or knee would be hanging over the side of the bed. It was that narrow. So if you move in your sleep and are of an average or above average size, don’t be surprised if during the night, you find that a limb or two is hanging off the bed.We ate dinner at the hotel once. I guess they were closing for the night, because the wait staff pressured us to place our order ASAP ( I mean literally, as soon as we sat down). The price was quite expensive for the quality and quantity of food we got. I suggest you eat outside the hotel.Next time I go to Singapore, I will pay the extra dollars to upgrade to a hotel with a better location (e.g. Orchard, Clark Quay, etc) and more standard sized rooms. Ibis is good if you’re in a pinch and don’t really mind your accommodations. Otherwise, look elsewhere.",278
IBIS_BEN,3,"“Typical Ibis, friendly staff, some housekeeping issues”","Stayed here for three nights in Feb 11. This is a typical Ibis with the smallish rooms that are common for the brand and well designed but equally small bathrooms. Whilst other Accor hotels feature some of the most outrageous internet pricing schemes (which often prevent me from staying at Accor hotels), this Ibis has free wifi in the rooms which is a definit bonus.Staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel has a bar/restaurant on the ground floor (which we did not try), a 7-Eleven next door, and a range of other restaurants within five to 10 minutes walk. The hotel is located at about 10 minutes walk to the closest MRT station (Bugis). It is also one block away (five minutes walk) from Sim Lim Square, the electronics shopping mall.Sleep quality was good due to no noise from surroundings and good quality bed. We had however two housekeeping issues, the first was that there was only one small bar of soap provided on the first day (none on the second and it was so small that you use it up during one or two showers); the second was that on the second day all towels and bath mat were taken away by housekeeping but not replaced, so we had to call them when we arrived in our room after a day in the city and have them deliver a set.Overall an average Ibis, with friendly staff, and some housekeeping issues they should fix. Management emailed a survey a day after we left and responded quickly so it is likely the housekeeping issues will have been fixed (or at least looked into) by the time you read this.",13

IBIS_BEN,3,“Small but comfortable”,"The room is small but compensated by an efficient layout. This is an absolutely no frills hotel. Check out at noon otherwise you could be locked out because the keycards expire on the dot. lobby too public. The wash-rooms are like public toilets. I sat at the lobby for a while and saw members of the public having free access. Counter staff just go through the motions. No smiles, none of their business kind of attitude. This is suppose to be a cheap hotel and what's more to expect from us kind of attitude. Pure budget, no fond memories.",32

IBIS_BEN,2,“So.. so.. get what you pay for”,"Would not stay again. expecting a good nights sleep? Make sure you dont stay in the room 1616. When checked in asked for a quiet room (top floor in our experience), was given a room next to the elevator! So sleeping felt like in a metro station. Only later in the evening after a day of sightseeing realized that the annoying noise every 30 seconds was from the elevator just behind the wall. Surprisingly reception knew nothing about it (very hard to believe that we are the only ones to have ever complained about this). No other room was offered. I dont know anyone who would pay to stay in that room so will not go back, plenty other choices in singapore. Location was ok though if you plan to hang around in Bugis/little India area. But for this price there are plenty of choices.",271
IBIS_BEN,1,“Need better trained staff and much better food”,"We stayed at the hotel in December for four nights. The location is quite convenient and the room was clean. Other than that, we were quite disappointed. We arrived late at night. In spite of making the reservation two months before, we were told that there were no nonsmoking rooms available and if we wanted, we could change rooms the following day. Since our time was pretty tight, the last thing we wanted to do was to unpack and pack again for the move, so we stayed on the smoking floor which left us with a bad impression of the hotel. The stay did not improve much afterwards. The hotel staff was of no help when you needed any information other than how to get to all the well-known touristy places (Orchid Road, Little India, etc.) I wanted to visit the nature reserve and asked at least five people but none seemed to know where it was and how to get there. That was just one example.Whatever you do with the food, please do yourself a favor and don't eat at the hotel. It was just terrible. I had their chili crab, the fried noodles, and the laksa – they were by far the worst food I had had through the entire trip. I had to wait for about 15 minutes just for a bowl of rice which tasted like leftover from the day before. We had stayed at other Ibis hotels, but this was the worst.I hope the hotel management reads these posts and will make an effort to train its staff and improve the quality of food it serves.",85
IBIS_BEN,3,“Hotel with good location but to expensive”,"This hotel has a good location and if wanted many sights can be visited from here walking. At the front desk there should be more people as it is a very busy hotel. More attention should be given to the cleaning staff as the process is very slow, one evening still at 18.00 hours they were cleaning rooms. I desisted having mine cleaned that day.The breakfast buffet is good but is lacking an egg station. Altough of good quality what is offered is too expensive.",228
IBIS_BEN,3,“New Year's Eve Holiday”,"We took 4 rooms and stayed for 4 nights, during checks in, the hotel reception staff kindly showed us the room, smoking/non smoking floor, with connecting door, and they offered to clean the room first from cigarettes scent.At the lobby, they provides brochures/leaflets/map of Singapore's which is very useful if we want to know Singapore's interesting places, also they provide bus route to Orchard Road, and other places. We had to carry the luggages by ourself with a trolley provided, that's the compensation for the hotel stars.The room itself is very clean, not spacious, but we can fit large luggages under the bed, or the table beside the window, cigarettes scent not exist anymore cause they already did clean it as promised. Deposit box, towels, amenities, and coffee/tea provided, but the refrigerator is too small and not cold enough. The room is silent enough, good for sleep especially we travelled with a baby. The room window is only protected with one layer of curtain, so in the broad daylight it would be so shiny, again thats the compensation of the hotel star's.The hotel's restaurant serve only limited choice of food, but many places to eat nearby in a walking distance. Besides, we only use the hotel for rest/sleep, most of the time we went city tours. Overall we enjoyed our stay, and would like to come again sometime...",96
IBIS_BEN,2,“Could not be more compact”,"Very basic hotel, good for those who are on a budget, however when compared to other south east asian countries, the tariff was not economical. I am told that hotels in Singapore are expensive, and most of them have compact rooms. The best thing about this hotel is its location! Walk down to Sim Lin square, or to Raffles Street, or to any other place, take a bus from almost without stepping outside the hotel. Very convenient. Rooms are too small with modern budget furnishing, thoughtfully designed though to accommodate all in such a small room.",56

Around 15 mins to Raffles and another 10-15 to the river and the main business district. The rooms are nondescript, quite small with ensuite and satellite tv. It was quiet considering the amount of people coming and going.I didn't have breakfast or any other meal at the hotel as it was quite over priced. We ate breakfast at Kopitiam which is a collection of street food stalls. The food is gorgeous and cheap. It is on the corner of Bencoolen and Bras Basah.I would stay again as it is a location for the price but the key is to book early. Cost of rooms were ridiculous if you just walked in off the street.",17

Breakfast buffet Ok however get there early to avoid feeding frenzy. Does have coin operated washer & dryer (and free use of iron) on the 3rd floor. There is a very nice bus to the airport which the hotel can book, for $S 9.00 it's a deal since the subway is a haul and taxi's can be costly. Staff does not recognize Accord Club members, no special welcome or treatment.",148
IBIS_BEN,2,“No frills”,"Stayed here for one night. I had booked my room based on good feedback from fellow TripAdvisor members. I did have some reservation for Ibis as I knew it is Accor's economy hotel chain. The pros:-Room and hotel in general was pretty clean-They did have a restaurant with somewhat friendly stuff-Location is pretty goodThe cons:-Rooms are very basic, very-Room is very small-Their TV was smallest I have ever seen in any hotel-Fridge was unusable (mini sized fit for few cans)-No minibar-I did see some suspicious gentlemen wandering on my floor, maybe they were guestsAll in all Ibis is not bad hotel, but it is economical choice for those who do want to stay in no frills hotel. It offers enough for those who do not wish to get more than basic things. My rating for Ibis is rather 2 than 3 stars. I will not stay here again.",38

IBIS_BEN,2,"“4 star price for basic 2 star hotel, disappointed”","I am not really sure why this hotel gets such glowing reviews because we were disappointed in almost every aspect. We're traveling around the world and have stayed at dozens and dozens of hotels from North America, Europe and Asia and this place was not a good memory for us at all. The normal rack rate for the Ibis is S$248 and up ($190 USD) for a tiny 2 twin bed room with no closet, no bathtub, no fridge, no desk, no chair, no view, no luggage rack, no space in general, uncomfortable beds and 1 pillow. Oh btw the hotel has no pool or gym, and a really poor restaurant and offers NO room service. Breakfast is also extra for S$18 a person!I paid online for a special at $135 US for a 7 night stay, thinking this would be a great deal on a nice room for our first trip to Singapore.Upon checking in the clerk was shocked to find out we were staying 7 days, she had no idea why. I guess people only stay here for a day or two, given the cramped quarters I can see why!I cannot imagine paying full price for this hotel, every room is the same too there are no nicer rooms. They are all cheap business traveler rooms, but why they have no desk I don't know. The bathroom was pretty small too for such a pricey room. My husband and I have an internet business and spent a lot of time in our room in between meals working online. We basically had to lay on the bed and work with our stuff pilled up all around us because there was no where to put any of it. We could barely even fit our 2 medium sized luggages on the \bench\"" they have and there's only little cubby holes in a bookshelf like unit to stuff a few belongings. The \""fridge\"" is the worst joke I've ever seen. An electric cooler which only fits 2 bottles of water, so forget about having food in the fridge to keep for later. Some of our fruit rotted in the room because we weren't able to put it in the fridge, same with our salad greens. I thought at least for the price we could enjoy something else about the hotel, maybe a pool, or a gym, or a bite to eat. Not possible. I fail to see what is so special about this hotel which offers no amenities or comfort. The restaurant had absolutely no vegetarian food on the menu, which was very strange considering there were 7 vegetarian restaurants in the building next door, and Singapore in general is very vegetarian friendly. So needless to say we could not eat at the hotel restaurant at all. The menu is not really a menu either, you just pick 3 things for a tiny entree meal off of their list and that's what you get. There isn't a full menu to pick a proper meal and they don't even have garden salads on the menu either, strange.The maid service here frustrated us to no end. They would walk into our rooms immediately after knocking between 9 and 10am and we'd scream and then they'd say oh sorry and go away. So we started going to bed with the do not disturb sign on the door. When we would leave before lunch time we'd put the make up room sign on the door and come back 3 - 4 hours later to find out the room had not been made at all! They did not come back to clean our room until almost 4 pm every day! WHAT? When they finally came in I went downstairs to use the restaurant washroom and came back and the beds were made and we had new towels. Obviously it takes them 5-10 minutes to service a room, so having to wait until 4 pm every day to get cleaned is ridiculous, that or having it cleaned at 9 am when you're still sleeping. Neither works well. So as we needed to use the room the majority of the afternoon this was very frustrating for us because the garbages needed to be taken out and we needed new towels and it was not comfortable. The only good thing about our stay at the Ibis was the fact that it is in a good location for getting some fresh juice, vegetarian foods, and checking out the local area where you can find pretty much anything else you need in Singapore to shop for. The staff were smiley and perfectly pleasant, but the hotel was a low point in our trip. The view of the hotel is pretty poor too and nothing to be excited to open your curtains to in the morning.Next time we come back, we will be finding a better hotel. The inflated price does not justify the severe lack of comfort and amenities here.""",361
IBIS_BEN,2,“Disappointing overall”,"I'm a big fan of the Ibis chain for their generally great locations and pricing. Ibis Bencoolen is a new hotel, unfortunately the staff they hired are appaulingly rude.I've had two stays in this hotel within the last month for 3-4 days each stay. Both make me question why I bother booking through Advantage Plus. On the more recent stay, we'd asked for a Queen bed room, which was aavailable when we booked it on the Advantage Plus website, but they'd allocated that room to a walk in instead of locking it out (the point of paying for it via the Advantage Plus website).When confronted, the staff said that they would just give us a twin share room (the two single beds pushed together). This really isn't a big deal, but for a young, active couple, it is. Secondly, we booked the queen bed. Why was it given to a walk in?The attitude of the staff the next day when we requested to speak with the Front Office Manager was basically well the staff told you they'd just give you the twin share room. Seriously? A manager gives you that response? I know what they said, but why did it happen when the booking clearly said (that they had a copy of) we'd booked and paid for a queen bed.Both stays have left a stain on us as service is important, more than the room quality. If the management of this Ibis would put as much effort into look and feel of the hotel as they did for the selection of the staff, this would be a great place. The rudeness and arrogance of most of the staff is big let down for this hotel.The rooms are great though, well laid out and everything you need feature wise (including free internet). As long as the end to end reservation is fine, and you don't need to deal with the staff, it's a great place to stay. Due to the service and the price (very expensive for Ibis), you'd be better off paying a few dollars extra to stay at Novotel, which is what we will be doing on our next stay.",206

IBIS_BEN,3,“Ratings can be deceiving”,"We booked at Ibis Singapore due to the good ratings it had gotten. Location was very good as it was very accessible from Changi airport by MRT. It was also near the Bugis shopping district. However, Check in was slow as the queue markers were not properly designated.We expected a small room based on previous pictures by reviewers. It was too bright with too many lights accentuated by the plain white painted walls. Pillows were virtually non existent as they were too soft. I'm wondering why they even put in a refrigerator which could only fit a water bottle. The bathroom tiles were also very cheap looking. Considering this is a newly built hotel, these 3 features lead to my disappointment.",47
IBIS_BEN,3,“first Ibis expereince”,Friendly helpful staff that make you feel at home. could do better with more variety of food serve. Breakfast limited selection but basics are there. Close to MBS. Room tight but comfortable especially type of matress. Like the cleanliness and friendly staff most. Dont like the food.,39

IBIS_BEN,2,“do not look on the name (ITS NOT TRUE)”,The rooms are clean but small; make sure you double lock your rooms before going to bed at night because the housekeeping knocks on the door and sometimes open it even when you are asleep; beware of the rudeness of the reception desk not all of them are friendly but Sitti is Very Good.,60
IBIS_BEN,3,“Better than average for budget conscious”,Well located hotel close to Bugis Markets and Mall. Also within walking distance (20-30 mins) to Orchard Road and Little India.

The reception staff were efficient and friendly and the hotel provides a very good luggage holding facility if you have to catch a late flight. Breakfast was not included but was very good with a large selection.",422
IBIS_BEN,3,“Functional”,"Check in was a breeze. Took me only 5 minutes or so.Don't expect anyone to help you with your luggage. I took all of my 4 bags by myself using the airport cart which, was available by the hotel lobby. Weird, I know, but it helped me... I even had to ask the front desk clerk if it was alright for me to bring it upstairs and they said yes.My room was small, maybe around 30 square meters. It had a flat screen tv, a desk and of course a bed which was functional and comfortable as well.The bathroom had a shower and was compact, but did its purpose nonetheless. There are no bathtubs here, but at least, the shower area had a glass partition between it and the toilet to prevent the entire bathroom from being wet.Initially, I had difficulty dealing with the faucet because only hot water was coming out. I had to call the maintenance and they came in after about 15 minutes. Funny, but all he had to do was switch the sticker from lef to right since the blue color which indicates \cold water\"" was positioned wrongly (it was on the side of the hot water). He was also kind enough to tell me how to use the faucet.My room came with free buffet breakfast and unlimited wifi, which incidentally was my main reason for choosing this hotel, apart from it being close to my area of business.The breakfast was okay, there was enough selection for anyone, although it can get tiring after the 2nd day, since they pretty much serve the same thing.I looove their coffee.The unlimited use of the internet was great and the speed was just right.Getting a cab from this area is easy, my longest wait was 5 minutes.Chinatown and bugis market is just a few blocks away, very good for those who want to get good bargains.There are a couple of sights to see nearby, like a Chinese temple and a museum.Check out took about 15 minutes. I paid in cash and while they mentioned that they will cancel the reservation they made with my credit card provider at the start of my stay, to this day, they still haven't. which reminds me, I need to call them again.Overall, this hotel works for any business traveller.Oh, and did I tell you about their mini ref? Don't expect a buddy ref, this one looks like a toy! It can only fit in about 6 cans of soda. Don't fret though, it works okay.""",150
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good value if booked in advance.”,"Singapore is not a cheap place to visit and the hotels can be expensive. By pre booking I saved around 45% on the walk in rate. This is one of the better Ibis hotels. Very efficient reception, pleasant and helpful. Free internet in the lobby & free in room wifi. A good bar and also friendly restaurant that serves a kind of Asian tapas menu. Rooms were on the small side-but average for an Ibis. Bathroom seemed a bit tired & dated. The room does give you a good TV & a small mini fridge. The usual minimal Ibis clothes storage.Reasonable location, Bugis is a busy market/shopping area, so you have stalls and also department stores. Nearest MRT is 10 minutes walk, so not too bad & you can get almost anywhere on the MRT.Would definitely stay here again rather than pay some of the high prices demanded in Singapore.",91

I thought it should be replaced everyday, like disposable plastic spoons you get at some fast-food outlets (one-time use only).

IBIS_BEN,3,"“NOT CHEAP BUT TOP VALUE IN SINGAPORE, NOT GREAT SERVICE”","This hotel is nice, very simple but nice. I am used to consider Ibis as a low cost brand and effectively it is also here, the problem is that in Singapore a room for USD 150 is cheap, so that is Ibis.The hotel is quote new and modern. Rooms are little but well maintained and clean. Our room had been recently painted and there is a bit of paint smell, but in general we slept good.We booked a special fare on Accor website and, as it has happened a lot of times in our Indonesia holiday, promises on the website are not supported by knowing of reception staff that seems not to consider what you buy on the site. In the fare were included: free tour of the city, discounted tickets for a lot of attraction in Sentosa and museums and a prize up to USD 1.000. At our arrive as usual nobody make anything for the fact we are A-Club members and no mention at all at our particular fare.In the morning when we left, we asked for our free tour and discounts and they told us it was too late, we had to book the evening before… Without any words, if they only had told us at the right time!!!Anyway internet connection is free and quite good.Breakfast is good, nothing made express but good.In general I liked the hotel and found it a good value for Singapore’s prices, but if compared to European or American standard it is pricy.",111

So the good things were it was very new and very clean, a launderette on site, the beds (albeit two singles - despite requesting a queen) were very comfortable and it was centrally located with good strong free wifi in the room (one device only!). What lets it down? The $18 breakfast! The frosty staff and most of all the paper thin walls. We could hear EVERYTHING our neighbours were doing -- sadly our neighbours were doing most things after 11pm at night, when we were trying to sleep. Despite complaining to the front desk about the 'construction' happening in the room next door -- seriously there was a vacuum being used at midnight! Nothing was done about it, which meant two poor nights sleep.

But he almost mocked my request which surprised me. I beat a hasty retreat quite humiliated. I then asked for a second WiFi account to connect my phone to avoid the Roaming Data charges. Though it is specified that they can provide the same on request, they declined. I stood for a few minutes as I entered to watch the soccer match on the TV display just as I entered the hotel and the hotel objected saying that I will have to order something to watch the TV!!3. The rooms are small. I was surprised at the size of the rooms.4. The passageways were narrow and long and made me feel claustrophobic.5. No complimentary breakfast. No options for vegetarians in anycase.6. Super tiny cooler. Couldn't even fit an Orange Juice tetrapack.7. Terrible TV quality. The LCD TV itself is small. And I would have expected the basic channels to have decent quality. However the quality was terrible. I don't think the issue was with the transmission. It was the quality of the display. It was a very cheap quality display. Limited choice with just about 20 channels or so.",58
IBIS_BEN,3,“Good hotel for a budget traveler but not so good for a business traveler”,"Stayed here on a business trip and found the rooms are very small and not so comfortable. The hotel does offer free wireless internet in the rooms and the coin-operated laundry on the 3rd floor is convenient but not a good business hotel. Rooms are new and clean but very small, felt more like Tokyo instead of Singapore",127
IBIS_BEN,3,“Nice overall but unreasonable rate hike”,"My original trip was planned for 3 days, and I chose to stay at Ibis Bencoolen, as it seemed reasonably priced (as a budget hotel option) and newly constructed. I had to extend my stay by a day, but was told by the staff that the new rate will be charged, which was SGD100 more than the first booking. I wasn't too happy about that, so decided to move to Aqueen on Lavender for the 4th night.Once I reached Aqueen, I realised that I liked it much more than Ibis. Anyway, Ibis hotel seemed busy all 3 days. Ideally located and reasonable rooms. Free wi-fi. Helpful staff. 7-11 right next door. Good budget hotel, but I wouldn't be paying more than SGD 170 per night (excluding taxes).",79
IBIS_BEN,3,"“\Hard nosed Attitude\""”""","Arrived in Singapore at 05.30hrs on sat 17/04/2010. I made my way to this hotel which I had booked on line. \Could I have the room sooner than 12.00hrs I enquired\""? Certaintly sir but you will have to pay half the 'Rack Rate'( which was 5 hours) They would not budge on this price. So I spent the next few hours wondering around Singapore.I wonder why they call these places HOTELS! Not Impressed with this kind of treatment. mikejamesperth.""",26
IBIS_BEN,3,“ideal for stopover hotel”,good location and good value if booked as part of Singapore ailines deal. Room cleaning and housekeeping was a bit slack could do better! Generally ok.,407
IBIS_BEN,3,“Tiny rooms but very clean and great location. However getting there by car is a nightmare.”,"I traveled from Malaysia to Singapore using our own car. If you intend to travel by car, you must buy a VEP card from the custom and you must pay in Singapore dollars. These VEP cards can be topped up at any 7-11s. I was not prepared for this and thus wasted more time parking our car, queuing, filling up forms, etc. You have been warned.Driving on the highway was easy, however, once we got closer to the city. That's when the nightmare began. Despite studying Google maps before hand, we still got lost. Luckily we had GPS but it kept disconnecting. So I highly recommend to study Google maps and get yourself a GPS that doesn't disconnect every 5 minutes.When we finally found our way to Bencoolen road, I could see the hotel but there was no street or lane to enter the hotel. You have to enter from the back, YOU CANNOT enter via Bencoolen Street. You have been advised. We drove around in circles but finally found our way.Now the hotel is very trendy and looks great. The rooms however are tiny. The bed's edge to the wall is about 2 shoulder widths. The 'desk' was attached on the window sill. The bathroom drainage was very poor, after every shower it flooded and drained very slowly. The amusing thing I found was a sign encouraging guest to recycle their towels. I personally am all for this but to be honest, I am a guest, I want fresh towels after coming back from a long hot day walking and shopping around the city. I think daily fresh towels is q service that should be provided by every hotel big and small.The place despite the room's smallness, it was very very clean. I liked the wooden floor boards. There were some channels on the flat screen, watched a movie or two. The beds were very comfortable and the air-conditioning was great. It was cold as!The rooms looked exactly like the images on their website (I know some hotel rooms don't like their pictures) The hotel is walking distance to everywhere in the city. The location is great... but not for driving (for first time visitors)! Singapore is a really beautiful and clean city. The only thing that stops me from visiting this lovely country is the exchange rate. I prefer to go Malaysia or Thailand where my Australia dollar gets me bang for my buck. :)",39

IBIS_BEN,3,“Very average budget hotel”,"I think this hotel is overrated. The room rate is ok, so long as you book far enough in advance (use www.accorhotels.com). My advice however would be to pay a few dollars more for a better hotel. There are plenty of good deals going in Singapore if you search around the web. Breakfast was just ok, but not that great for the money. Fairly basic selection and the quality was not good (eg over cooked bacon and very watery scrambled eggs). The rooms in the IBIS are VERY small. While this hotel is relatively new the room was already showing plenty of signs of wear and tear (ie lots of scuff marks and noticeable scratches on furnishings). Very small lobby area which seemed to be always crowded and busy. I stayed here because I read some good reviews, got a good room rate (including breakfast). But I wouldn't stay here again. There are better value options in Singapore.",25
IBIS_BEN,3,“adequate”,Convienient location near to Bugis Shopping and MRTRooms small but clean.Reception staf were polite and helpfullgood alternative to the more expensive hotels on orchard Road,107
IBIS_BEN,3,“ok but....”,"I booked in advance and i am an a club member. I clearly booked a smoking with king bed with a request for a high floor. Anyhow i ended up with two beds big enough for a child with a nice view of the front building. Usually being a member of the hotel club and on your first stay you get an upgrade or at least what you booked for, that has been my experience untill today. Ok value for singapore, room is clean but definitly disapointing for what you usually get for your money in south east asia. Anyhow not sure i will stay here again",79
MBS,3,“Staff In Reception Cold”,"We stayed here on way back from Europe, for a couple with jetlag very noisy , beds were hard, and staff on reception were coldThey say check out is between 10 - 12, this is not true, my elderly husband was feeling a little unwel and flight was not till afternoon, asked if we could have perhaps later checkout, was told quite coldly NO.We shall definetely not be staying here again, one positive was the restaurant, meals were lovely",74
MBS,3,“overpriced for an average room”,"it was a friday and we were charged $196 a night for the room. dunnoe if it includes breakfast. Location was wonderful. 7 eleven just a few steps away plus a few eateries as well. Small room, small tv, no frills kinda room I should say. U can also hear people out in the corridor if they are talking or slamming the doors. Overall, I'm sure I can find similar rooms with lower price.",40
MBS,1,“Marina Bay Sands”,This is not a 5 Star hotel. The service is useless. The staff are incompetent. If you are looking for a 5 star hotel choose The Raffles hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the view and the pool. ,218
MBS,3,“Pros and Cons”,"I am very disappointed with the room and service, I was told that my room is ready and located at level 5 because of I requested a smoking room. I did ask to change to higher level room but it cannot be done since it was the only available for smoking room. Later on in the room, I called housekeeping for an ashtray. Unfortunately I was told that it is a non-smoking room which I felt very funny. I explained that I was told it is a smoking room and I asked her to recheck with the receptionist. After 10 minutes she called to confirm it is a non-smoking room. This is so not professional and such a waste of time. If I knew this would happen, definitely I will ask a non-smoking room which located higher than level 5.The view from the room at level 5, I can see nothing but only taxis and cars down under and the Marina Expo and Mall which make me really upset. Furthermore I was a bit shocked that the room didn’t come with a bath tub. As a Hotel that represent 5 stars or more, I personally think that bath tub is a need to be provided in any room and it does reflect MBS image.Infinity Pool definitely the best!",128
MBS,3,“Huge hotel!”,Stayed here for the F1 for 4 nights. The lobby is sooo huge that it looked like an airport. Lots of people in the area. Shops and restaurants are everywhere and food court is open 24 hrs which was a good thing coz after the race we got at the hotel around 1am and we need food and glad we found the place still open though about 3 or 4 stalls were open but still okay with us. The pool area was also crowded but the water was good and the view was amazing! The price during our stay was also very high maybe because of the F1 event. We liked to hang out at The Fuse Bar coz they have good music and nice staffs in there. ,117
MBS,3,"“Great Hotel, but Mandatory Upgrade Fees”","Great hotel, but hotel has an atrocious practice of letting you book one room, and then forcing you to upgrade upon arrival, because the room you booked is either in the worst possible location (2 floor out of 47( and if you want a different better location, you must wait, because they do not know what else is available. I refuse to believe that with checkout time at noon, MBS does not know what rooms are available at 2PM. This is a predatory practice to force you to pay additional fees on check-in and this happened to me three times in a row. Simply inexcusable and I am hoping someone is going to do something about this. ",49
MBS,2,“Interior of Marina Bay Sands is below par for what is supposed to be 5 star hotel”,My room smelled of damp and had water trickling sounds from air conditioner for my entire stay. This made it very difficult to sleep and as so it was not a very relaxing stay. The interior does not fit the rating and the outside look of Marina Bay Sands.,75
MBS,2,“Lack of guest follow up”,"The main atraction of this hotel is the amazing swiming pool, one of the best I have ever seen. Beside this, there is a lack of follow up of the guest requets, its almost imposible to speak with somebody to arrange something prior your arrival, and if you request something special for your stay, even that you send thi request by email to the proper channel-employee on charge, in my case was never taken care.",35
MBS,3,“Stay in Marina Bay Sands”,view from swimming pool is fantastic but room condition was nothing special compare to other 5 stars hotel and not worthy as much as i paid. even receptionist gave us disable room without any notice.. ,46
MBS,3,“MBS”,"Pretty much loved our stay at Resorts World Equarius compared to this despite its almost twice price. If not for the Infinity Pool, I would not recommend staying at MBS. The room was undoubtedly spacious but nothing else more. The bathroom area was average, nothing exciting.",65
MBS,3,“experienced the endless swimming pool at top of singapore”,"The hotel is in great location and serves as the great sign of the city. The overall design and the swimming pool at the top floor is the breath taking scene. However, nothing in particular at the hotel room gave guest impressive memory indeed. The hotel is too much commercial without enough space for public area, for example the pool is too crowded for 2400rooms",46
MBS,2,“Don't arrive early in the morning”,"Had an overnight flight coming in at 6am. Hotel Frontdesk was completely understaffed at that time, had to wait for 40minutes to get through the queue only to learn that my prebooked room wasn't available. No real apologies, just business as usual for hotel management. Disappointing",172
MBS,1,“The room has fly and they dont care”,"As I work for Sands Cotai Central Macao before. The hotel room is exactly the same and the design is just 4 star hotel level no surprise. And the room has fly near the smoke detector. I told the Room service but their action is too slow. I have waited for 20 minutes. I cant wait and get out the room to pool. I have to call your team again and ask them to come by themself. After I was backed, no one told me anything has been done. Its just nothing. The room service sucks and need to improve immediately. I feel like you pay the money and just get in the room. For this price of hotel, the room detail and service is totally cant reach the standard. I lived in Mandarin Oriental after visit Sands. They are friendly and fast response to our enquiry. In Sands, what i can see is only an american style Lobby and Famous Pool only. If you have the budget try Mandarin Oriental definitely.",71
MBS,3,“Great expectations!!”,"Our friend recommended this hotel for a romantic stopover at Singapore on our way back from New Zealand. We had high expectations. While the grandiose structure, height and rooms were very good, the extra large uber size of the hotel put us off. The lobbys are always crowded and feel like an airport terminal. You have to queue up for everything ..... Check in , Check out and even for breakfast!!!!",56
MBS,3,“Not so Amazing!”,The pool and view are cool. But seems overrated over-all. This place only good for first timers. Not a good place to visit again as so expensive but staff are not high quality. The reception looks messy with all the people just walking or standing around. Really an overrated hotel. Did not impress me at all.,225
MBS,2,“Bad Service and OverPriced”,"I do not write any reviews before but really think that I should make an effort with this hotel. The Club Room is ok but not worth over $800. The worst part is when I check out in the morning, the staff at the check out counter did not even know how to pritorize her work. After she served the old couple in front of me, she immediately picked up the phone and talked over 10 minutes.. Finally, I could not wait for her anymore and went to the queue for Normal Room. The staff over there was ok and check me out within 2 minutes. After I check out, I went to the same staff at the Club Room/Suite counter who kept me waiting for over 10 minutes. I told her that she could quickly me check me out and make the call after then since there is on one in the queue except me. Her answer is just \Do you want me to help you check out now\"" . After I come back, call to the hotel and left my mobile which I want to file a complaint but one one ever bothers to call me back. If you want to stay in a good hotel, try Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore which really is a 5 stars hotel which provides 5 stars services.""",111
MBS,3,"“Great pool, but overall not satisified...”","Postive:Impressive pool area (although too crowded), great view, friendly bell boysNegative:Way too impersonal, we did not feel as warm welcomed guests during our stay. The check in area has the charm of a ticket counter at a railway station. We first got a smoker room although we have explicitely requested a non smoker room. We found panties from our predecessors in the closet. One day we wanted to cross via the pool area from KuDeTa to our room in tower 1 a couple of minutes after 11pm but access was denied for us. We were asked to go all the way down to the hotel lobby, which is a big detour.",37
MBS,3,“so so...”,overall the experience was not that spectacular for the money spentwould have expected more furniture given the size of the room service is good and personnel kind and attentiveclose to a large choice of shops and restaurants,41
MBS,3,“room too small”,"The bedroom is too small n the facilities are standard. Comparing the price with the condition of the bedroom was not a good valued. I've stayed in some hotels in Las Vegas are more valuable regarding the size, facilities and luxury.",120
MBS,3,“Non personal clinical experience”,"The hotel is somewhat overwhelming in size and you get an immediate sense that the personal touch will be missing. Concierge and porter staff were friendly, queries placed with express services were promptly answered, but a connection was not there. The service is robotic, I felt like I was just another one of their 2,500 clients staying the night. To be fair the views from the Sky Park and pool are amazing and Ku de Ta was great for fine dining. If you're the type of person that likes personalised service then this is not the place for you. If you like mega concerts and are happy to be just another face in the crowd then you'll love this place.",120
MBS,3,“Stunning property but lacks warmth”,"There's no doubt that it's a stunning property but the hotel felt very impersonal. The hotel staff lacked warmth and just didn't really care who came and went, something unacceptable for a 5* hotel. The room was wonderful but the toiletries look and feel cheap — again, unacceptable from a 5* property. The infinity pool, although sensational, was far too crowded to take in the experience — also, the slow service from the poolside staff didn't help matters. I stayed here out of curiosity and was thoroughly disappointed — it was a rather unforgettable stay. If you have stayed at any of the Taj or Oberoi properties in India and kinda expect that sort of service and warmth, be warned.",231
MBS,1,“Poor housekeeping service”,"1. The air conditioner flow was very poor. In the first room i was allotted (t2 771), the room temperature refused to go below 27c even though the air con was set at 18c with high fan speed. Eventhough i was alloted another room, the situation did not improve much. 2. When i was shifted from first room to the second room, i misplaced a few items as it was at 1.30AM and i was very sleepy. However, when the staff cleaned the room, they did not think to ask me before throwing away several important photographs which I had kept on the stand beside the bed. As some of them were the only copies that I had, I'm really upset. There was also a blanket that I had I left behind but that can be replaced. Surely the housekeeping staff should have realised that really old photos of children might have sentimental value, especially in an era where photos remain in digital form. I was really disappointed when I had called MBS to ask about the missing items and to be told that they had not been kept aside. I have stayed at hotels where they called me to let me know that my girlffriend left behind a pair of (cheap) earrings. Surely a hotel that is considered one of the best should have better sense and service than this.",59
MBS,3,“Pool was good!”,"Total service was not bad. I got 'rise' 30 % discount coupon as a promotion. When checking out, I gave a coupon, staff said that it had to be presented before the meal. Those details didn't write in a coupon, and anyone didn't speak and I didn't know. So, I could not receive the coupon discount. It was unpleasant.",44
MBS,2,“Not worth revisiting”,Very disappointing 2nd stay at this hotel. It seems standards have slipped and we did not feel we got value for money here. Reception staff were not helpful. Traffic noise at our level was terrible and we got little sleep. Will not be revisiting ,39
MBS,3,“good”,"the room,the swimming pool, the location are good, but it's a werid smell from the pillow. The noise from the road below is not good. There are so many people in the lobby but no enough seats to take. ",37

MBS,2,“Disappointing for the money paid for!”,"Paid expensively for a very noisy crowd of customers at the pool and felt like a Club Med in Asia! Music by the pool and design choice of the furnitures in the room was outdated already! Safety box not working also. Nothing memorable except for the size of the pool, huge room and wonderful views of the city and the sea. That's it!",299
MBS,3,“Expat review”,"Infinity pool lived up to expectations although very crowded at weekends. Hotel over priced in my opinion although we enjoyed our stay - hotel felt like a money making machine e.g. Charging extra $1 for no ice for juice, $10 for extra fridge due to no room in hotel room fridge, $4++ for a small jug of milk for tea in the room as they only supply powdered milk. We were still glad we experienced the hotel and especially the pool but it is not a hotel to relax in! Room very nice although slightly starting to wear. One of the most comfy beds I have ever stayed in. Food excellent at Rise and my meal at Jason Quek Lv 57 second to none but my partner's steak was awful for the price looked like Sainsbury's meat. Overall though, I thought the quality of food was excellent. As we live in Singapore we didn't want to go to the Shoppes area and we felt there were not many areas to sit in the hotel - lobby amenities feel like being in a busy airport. Lv 57 soooooo busy at weekends which we accepted as the pool is the draw card for the hotel. Birthday cake was a lovely touch and slightly earlier check in appreciated. Cut at The Shoppes for anyone visiting are the best cocktails that I have tasted anywhere in the World! We had a lovely stay and would return but for me this was not value for money at all. Raffles staycation was a totally different experience and steeped in tradition and history - felt pampered, valued as a guest and would pick Raffles over MBS. I do feel though that for under 30 you would most likely prefer MBS. I hope this review helps others.",50
MBS,3,“just about ok”,"its good for a small stay , have stayed in 5star deluxe hotels all over but the experience is just about ok in marina bay , maybe the holidays in singapore , but nothing special for the price it charges, for this price , you can consider some other hotel",353
MBS,1,“Found underwear in suite room”,"I am extremely disappointed in my experience with Marina Bay Sands. We specifically chose this hotel because we thought it would be a luxury destination. It certainly was not, from the start of our stay until the end. The ONLY redeeming factor was the staff in the Club Lounge. Everyone was excellent. We stayed in the Orchid suite. When we checked in we were given poor directions to our room. Told \you are located in tower 2\"". When we go to tower two we can't find the room. There are two tower twos. No one near the towers was available to help. So we went to the concierge who told us, not we are in tower one. Again tried to find out room. Wrong information again. We finally just asked a random staffer, I think it was someone cleaning, and they were able to help direct us. From there the room was not up to any hotel standards. A dining table chair had ripped fabric, the bench at the end of the bed was stained. After some time some staff came to take out the furniture to replace it the next day. The next day I noticed stains on other furniture. The pool staff was also rude and changed rules on different days. We had asked if drinks were allowed in the pool and told yes because the cups are plastic, the next day we were yelled at to get out with the drinks. When we explained about the previous day they then said the drink had to be behind the yellow line. While some people still had drinks in the pool. Kids were often allowed to swim in the adults section for some time. The absolute worst part was on the last night finding the former guest's underwear between the bathtub and the mirrored wall. I went to speak to the front desk around 4am and they said they would investigate and call the room around 9am. No one called. When I went to the desk for checkout and told the story, no one seemed familiar with any of the previous complaints.""",282

MBS,3,“Not value for the money”,Check in and check out a nightmare. So many people waiting. The price you pay for the room we felt didn't deserve the price of over $500 NZ.Trying to swim in the pool it was just so crowded with children that we only hoped in just to take a photo and then got straight out. The pool is spectacular but for the size of the hotel it is just not big enough.,40

MBS,3,“Expensive View”,Very expensive hotel with regular rooms. Only the pool and the view is surely thrilling. If you really want to spend that money then visit just once for a night.

MBS,3,“Too expensive”,The hustle and bustle make you feel less respected. Not up to the standard of a 500 USD per night hotel. The fridge is loaded with expensive mini bar stuff and you can't make room for your own stuff. An extra fridge cost you 10 SG Dollars but the clumsiness of the service is ridiculous.,49
MBS,3,“Overpriced for what it has to offer”,Stay there just for the swiming pool. The rooms are just ok. The bedding linen did not smell good and the shower had a poor presure (not nice for a 5 star hotel). The staff service was poor ( we had to find out the hotel facilities by ourselves).,161
MBS,3,“The pool is worth it.”,"Check in- that is a nightmare. After an 8 hours flight and another hour delayed at Changi, the last thing you want is to wait in line for 30 minutes to check in. We were hungry, sticky and tired. This made it all worse.After check-in however, the experience was excellent. The view is breathtaking and the staff were beyond polite. Everything from room service to the concierge were good.The casino on the otherhand is a waste of time. Security are absolute losers who were impolite and disrespectful. The dealers seemed disinterested in the games and just assumed that everyone was going to play as they expected- thereby dismissively skipping people's turns in order to progress the game faster. Overall quite positive and the pool is worth it alone. Pictures do not do it justice. You have to go and see it the first time, but the check-in times alone pissed me off enough to make me reconsider staying at MBS again.",38
MBS,1,"“Terrible Service, Waste of Money”","Pathetic service, poor staff overall not worth staying at MBS, rather visit for a couple of hours. The check in and check out service is useless, you que like your in a fish market. Extremely expensive for everything",201
MBS,3,"“Luxury, but at a price”","I love Singapore and have visited often. This trip was a business event I hosted at the MBS. It was a bit of a luxury, but it was the low bid for the time we selected. First, it was a treat to stay there and have access to the top floors, the spectacular pool and the whole environment.But, to me the price was that you are a bit isolated from the rest of the fun of the city. yes, you can take a water taxi or the subway, but at the other hotels I typically stay at, you are in the heart of the actionThe other price to me is the crowds. it is ALWAYS crowded and busy. I felt a bit like a salmon swimming upstream, not the VIP hostess, responsible for 50 people. At other hotels, when I manage a group of 50 people I am treated like a VIP. not here.Lastly, be aware that you are in the middle of very high end shops and restaurants, and be ready to pay accordingly. Hotel staff were very nice. Banquet staff great and food at convention too fancy, but good.A treat, but I personally will probably choose differently next trip....",118
MBS,3,“Large and impersonal”,"Great hotel, can't complain about amenities, location, cleanliness or staff. In fact staff are very attentive. Problem with the hotel is that it's just too big - queuing for check in and check out is comparable to airport check in and very impersonal, this is amplified by the option of checking out via a kiosk.Rooms are very clean comfortable but the pool is massively over crowded - if all you want to do is take \selfies\"" then it's great.Normal checkout time is 11am and after checkout you cannot access the sky terrace or pool.For the price you can stay in a far more personal, luxurious and better value hotel. This hotel is aimed at large numbers not luxury.""",45
MBS,2,“Holdiays in a shopping Center”,"We wanted to see this hotel, it was the first time and it will be the last time... there are many better, more modern, more attractive hotels in Singapore, even at a better price... it is overcrowded, even the pool can't be used for swimming...",76
MBS,1,“Beware of loss of deposit”,"The rate for my room is 705 sgd. On the day of check-in, they asked me to pay 905 sgd in total ( including 200 sgd deposit) and promised to refund after check-out. A few days later, my card was charged another 705 sgd but i just thought that they would void the first bill. Today, after 2 weeks I still haven't received my deposit. I'm gonna wait for a few days before escalating the matter!!",70
MBS,2,“Poor Service”,"Bad Service for error in Mini-bar.It is automatically charge with unintentionally removal of cans.We want to freeze medicine but refrigerator was fully packed.Called twice but no staff was sending to take care this error.Bill was charged in the next morning when checking out with the machine.It was undeniable not to pay it!If I have to queue it up to ask staff, I think I will miss the flight for sure!",29
MBS,1,"“noisy, waited luggages for almost a hour!”","not worth of value, except infinity pool.......................................……........noisy rooms and waited lagguages for almost an hour. also vy late check in time at 3pm. this wasted much of the time.",261
MBS,1,"“Over Rated, Expensive, Terrible Service and Non luxurious”","This hotel did not meet expectations at all. It is very expensive and based on that you expect a certain standard to be delivered. The building from outside is impressive but the lobby area is all very basic in style. The check in is a long wait, like a las vegas hotel, long lines to check in. Our room was not ready, you don't expect to have to wait when you are paying so much money. The rooms whilst you would say they are nice and spacious, with a good view, they are very basic in style and like a business hotel, not luxurious at all, very disappointing. The pool area is not relaxing, it was absolutely packed with people all trying to get the same photo opportunity and it becomes a joke. We struggled to get a sun bed and the area and toilets were dirty. We went for our honeymoon and wanted to stay 3 nights, but it was full, so we only got 1, we then wished we had not bothered as it cost double than our second 5 star hotel which was far far superior and a true 5 star luxury where they give you good service and make you feel like you are valued and on holiday. Here you are just a number and you will pay dearly for it. There is not doubt that the engineering of this place is impresive, there are nice shops, casino, bars and restaurants so form that point it is an all in one stay. But be prepared to spend!",81
MBS,3,“The premier room is too small and not worhty of its price.”,"The Premier room is much smaller than the Deluxe room. The hotel's emploee tried to explain that \47-square metre haven\"" shown on the hotel's website should incloud of the balcony. However, the website did not mention it and the balcony is completly empty and dusty. and the rooms located on the lower floors in the price with others are noisy. The hotel's website doesn't disclose right and enough information to the public. The Premier room is not worthy of its price.""",91
MBS,2,“too crowded to enjoy”,"I was really disappointed with overall experience of the hotel. Check in was the main problem and a joke, They tried to accuse me that I had only booked for 2 and told me my daughter would have to share our bed and in a smoking room. After telling her that this was acceptable and getting my notebook out to show booking, I got upgraded, but had to wait 1 hr for room.Went to the pool and it was packed and no lounges available. I was so crowded it wasnt enjoyable.",366
MBS,3,"“If You LOVE Gigantic Hotels, Huge Crowds, then this is for You”","Stayed at the Marina Sands with my wife for our 2 first nights in Singapore. The reason was the same as most people that pay for their stay here; the famous rooftop pool. The infinity pool area spanning over the 3 large towers is indeed impressive; and the views outstanding. However, no amount of \Wow\"" from any of this will ever convince me of staying here again.Architecturally speaking, a good job was done by splitting the hotel into 3 towers; You really don't get the impression the hotel has over 2.000 rooms when You're on the bedroom floors; the problem is when You reach either the lobby or the terrace. The lobby is so gigantically crowded, that it makes Tokyo Station at rush hour seem like a semi-abandoned hall in comparison ! And it is this way practically all the time. The pool area is almost equally as crowded, jam-packed wall-to-wall with people and children running around, all the time, from 6am to 11pm.It feels like Vegas with humidity. Hoards of people everywhere, nothing around but immense shopping areas with overpriced high end shops, and even a casino for gambling away any money not already spent on the overpriced rooms, overpriced services or top-end shops.The Management does make an effort to provide decent service (when we arrived, we found several long strands of hairs on the bathroom sink and a noisy a/c; when complained we were quickly moved to another room despite the hotel being fully booked) but with 2.000 rooms, it must be a huge challenge for any Management anywhere to keep up a true 5-star level of service.If You \""must\"" stay here, do dish out the extra for the club rooms (non-club room guests are treated like 3rd rate cattle, as proven by the fact that the main food area at the pool level is for club guests only, and paid breakfast is eye-wateringly overpriced) and make sure to go for a room in tower 1 above the 23rd floor, where You'll be able to elevate Yourself directly from the rooms to the pool area on the 57th floor.There really are much better options in Singapore if You want a real 5-star hotel experience.""",177
MBS,3,“A nice escape in the city”,"It is supposed to be a luxurious iconic hotel where you can feel pampered. Perhaps I had high expectations due to the publicity but I think it is over-rated. The hotel was extremely crowded, we had to stand in queue for 30 min to check- in. The famous Skypark pool was crowded, we could not even find a chair near the pool. There were a lot of tourists wearing bath ropes around the hotel public area. Our first impression upon arrival was that this hotel was for big tour groups. The gymn manager was quite rude. Our 15 year old son was not allowed in, not even to accompany us but not touching the gymn machines. Hotel policies can be explained in a much more diplomatic way by putting himself in the customer's shoes (We paid a lot of money to have a good time)Having said that, the scenery was spectacular, the observatory deck was superb. We got an upgrade because it was our anniversary. That was a nice touch to make up for the down sides.",383
MBS,2,“Much better elsewhere”,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for 5 nights because of a conference taking place there and room was included in the Conference registration. We had heard great things of this hotel but I have to say that unless you love overcrowded spaces and mediocre service, then there are much better offerings in Singapore. The lobby is always full of people and there is no WOW factor on arrival just a feeling of having to battle a crowd just to get to the check in counter. We paid extra for an ungraded club room which I think is worth the money but again, expect to queue to get into the Club which is nothing special but adequate once you could access it. The pool area is so overcrowded we didn't bother. There is a nice view from the top but nowhere to enjoy it that isn't completely overrun with people and children. Again with over 2000 rooms, you have to expect a corresponding amount of people. Expect to spend a lot of time in lifts. Our room was in Tower 2 which meant that to get to the Club area, we had to catch a lift to the 55th Floor, then change lifts to get to the 57th floor with security area in between to check/swipe room keys etc. , more queues.....Club room was OK. They are quite big and bathroom very nice but attention to maintenance seems to be a little lacking such as motorized curtains not closing properly, leaving a gap which was impossible to close. The beds are very firm but ok and I will compliment the hotel on having comfortable pillows, something we find lacking in most hotels even 5 star.The Shoppes (shopping centre attached to the Hotel) is a bit of a waste of time unless you have a lot of cash and love the high end of town with all the designers present. However there is Suntech city and Marina Bay Link (I think that's what it's called) quite close, probably about a 15 minute walk across the Helix bridge.All in all, unless you really need to swim in the pool, there is much better places to stay in Singapore. To be honest, by the end of our 5 day stay, I couldn't wait to leave.",278
MBS,3,“Man made madness”,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for one night and two full days. We were upgraded to a corner suite and the room was very nice, the bathroom was amazing, in particular. However, I do not have much to say for the rest of the hotel. The pool is magnificently designed and the temperature was just right, but the bad outweighs the good here. There was SO many people there, i couldn't take a photo of the view because of the people in every direction. Also, there is a lack of shade up there which causes some serious sunburn! As checkout was at 11am, we left our bags with the concierge for the day. We came back in the afternoon to collect just one of our bags to get our swimmers out of. The man gave us the bag and kept our ticket. When we went to collect the other three bags, they refused to give us our bags as we didn't have out ticket. I described in detail what our bags looked like, what the address was on the bag tag, and even what they could find in the pockets of the bags. They still refused. Our flight was now boarding in 2 hours ( international )!! They rang down for the supervisor and we had to go through a long process in order to get our bags back. i was very unimpressed with the unfriendliness of the staff. As stated in the rating, the experience was very average. I would recommend this hotel just because of the amazing architecture and convenience of it being right in shopping centre- just remember to get your bags ticket back!",244
MBS,2,“A monumental disappointment”,"Stayed at the famed MBS for 6 days for a conference and it was all around disappointing. The room was mediocre for the amount you pay and the hotel is so big but so poorly planned that you are constantly walking long distances for any sort of facilities. Service was sparce - although you can feel they are trying but with their main target clientele being gamblers they have thin knowledge of restaurants to recommend, outside of what is in the hotel or in the 'Shoppes'. The adjacent 'shoppes' is also a huge collection of jewellery shops that is just no fun to roam around if you haven't hit the jackpot in the casino attached between the hotel and the 'shoppes' or if you're not Paris Hilton. There is an 'art/science' museum but I didn't enter. Annie Leibovitz was also being exhibited in the 'shoppes' when I was there although I didn't get the time to go in. Just for the sake of comparison, I went to into the IWC Schaffhausen 'boutique' to compare prices: the IWC Portfino hand-wound eight days with gold case was selling for S$26,000 (US$20,795). In Kuala Lumpur Pavillion IWC Schaffhausen boutique, the same model was selling for MYR57,000 (US$17,740). That's a US$2,260 difference! Clearly, it was not a great shopping destination either. Great view from the hotel though but only if you stayed in a high floor. If you smoke, expect to be put in a low floor room.",48
MBS,2,“poor”,"I booked a city view and non smoking room, got neither. The balcony had paint splatter and cigarette butts everywhere THe shower smelt of urine. Several other issues were also highlighted whilst raising a complaint a satisfactory solution. was not reached. The pool however was an enjoyable experience",244
MBS,3,“Fun hotel but overpriced for what you get”,"This hotel is beyond our usual price range but we decided to splash out and spend one night there, mainly so that we could have access to the rooftop pool, which is only accessible to guests. The rooms are well presented with floor to ceiling windows, endless views, large beds and luxurious bathrooms. They had complimentary toiletries, a hairdryer, stationery and a safe. However the wi-fi, that is supposedly complimentary, would not connect.Reception (certainly in Tower 3) was a desk in what was essentially a mall. There was no atmosphere other than ‘shopping mall’ and we had to ask how to get to our room. Staff were polite but did not provide the same level of service we have experienced in other luxury hotels.The rooftop pool has an incredible view over Singapore. There are also loungers along the side and a drinks service. Overall, we didn’t feel the services provided by the hotel made it worth the extremely high cost of staying there. The public can buy a ticket to access various observation decks and restaurants that are high up so the views can be enjoyed from there. The only thing this hotel provides over others is the ability to enjoy the view from the pool. While the hotel was fun and flashy, and nothing was ‘wrong’ per se, the exorbitant price of staying here meant we felt we would get far better value for money by staying elsewhere and simply visiting the SkyPark.",130
MBS,2,"“Poor service, expensive, pool too crowded - overrated”","I had high expecations for MBS given the amazing infinity pool photos, flashy website, and expensive prices. I was disappointed in almost all aspects of the stay. The rooms themselves were well appointed and large; however we were first placed on the second floor with a view of the highway. We asked to be moved to a higher floor after the first night; our request was accommodated but during the moving process the bellman took us to 3 incorrect rooms (including walking in on some poor lady in her room!!), before finally reappointing us, an hour later. Also the room service took over one hour, and the pool was way too crowded to enjoy. Frankly I expected a lot more for the cost.I would recommend the Westin, Raffles, Fullerton instead.",87
MBS,3,"“An experience, buts that's it”","We have stayed here for half our trip, the other half was at sentosa! Do I regret staying here, no would I stay again no, for 3 adults for dinner buffet was nearly $400 including 2 drinks each, was the buffet worth it, no I wished we had stayed one night and stayed at sentosa better food, better environment, too busy here it's like your in the middle of a busy highway all day everyday, and breakfast buffet is mental you need traffic lights to get around.",156
MBS,3,"“Hotel, not great. Pool, nice.”","This hotel is expensive. And if it weren't for the pool, it would be hugely overpriced. My friends and I stayed here for one night during our six week stay in Singapore for work just to use the pool. The rooms are unimpressive - my serviced apartment is much nicer (and cheaper). Check-in was a hassle, but that's to be expected. The view from the pool is what redeems the place. But even that is not perfect. Biggest issue - NO SHADE AT ALL. Most pools have umbrellas - here, not an inch of shade to be found. I ended up burned, even with applying and re-applying sunscreen every hour. It was just unavoidable.It's one of those things to check off the tourist list, but don't stay more than one night. And, if all you want is the view, and you don't need the pool, there are plenty of other places in Singapore to get it.",79
MBS,3,“Pool was amazing... Nothing else”,"I feel that the place is a little overrated as I do not see anything special with it. Its a huge place with too many rooms and I just feel the reception will need to be more interesting. It is as similar as the First World Hotel in Genting Highlands. Nothing to shout about except for the pool. Price is definitely expensive. Got to improve on the breakfast menu, as the quantity is there but quality was a rundown.",314
MBS,1,"“Marina Bay Sands - all hardware but no software, a disappointing stay”","I wanted to get a memorable stay for my son, wife and I to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Prepaid for an Orchid Suite, for 1 night and was assured the room will be ready for 2pm checkin, when booking was made, given the occasion. While the room was nice and big, everything else with our stay was terrible:a) Room was not ready at 2pm, and we got our room only at 3pm (which is their normal checkin). Despite having a \VIP checkin\"", instead of being quick and easy, it was a zoo and had a queue! b) As soon as we got into the room, Housekeeping came in to check the mini-bar (to find out the consumption of the previous guest)! c) The tv did not work, and we had to have another person come in to check thatd) Accessing your room and the 57th floor for skypool and club by the lifts was a joke.The access system does not work properly, and we had go up and down the lifts a few times before getting to our floor. And other guests had the same problem too. To add insult to injury, one of the bell boys got into our already crowded lift with his luggage cart and he too had access card problems! d) The skypool area was ridiculously crowded - a definite fire hazard, if God forbid, they had one.e) After my initial complaint, they sent a 6-inch cake (more like a slice) which did not taste good, and champagne - without investing the time to know we don't take alchohol. And they gave an extended checkout till 1pm, but we left by 9:30am.If you want to waste your money, this is the hotel to stay in Singapore. For half the money your spend, there are better 5-star hotel alternatives in Singapore that will make your stay much more enjoyable and memorable.""",232
MBS,1,“Expensively awful!!!!”,"If you want to pay a TON of money to stay in a packed hotel, this is the place for you. The pool, yes, it is absolutely stunning, BUT the view is hard to enjoy when there are 100s of people in it. My boyfriend and I walked around for about 40 minutes trying to find a poolside chair to no avail. We finally gave up and just jumped into the packed pool. We tried to enjoy it as best as possible but the mass quantity of people/the massive amount of photo shoots going on inside of the pool made it hard. I got out of the pool and stepped on a nail that was sticking out of the ground (a light was broken and they just put duct tape on it, five star hotel standards?). Oh, I also forgot to mention that when we came up to the pool and gave our hotel key they said we needed one key per adult and made us go back down to our room to get our other key. They forgot to do turn down service in our room, when checking in we waited about 20-30minutes, checking out was about 45minutes, and the whole hotel is just packed with people. All around awful....my least favorite hotel in Asia! If you want to see the view just go there for dinner, DO NOT STAY HERE!",160
MBS,3,“The sky park is what your paying for!”,"Amazing hotel, but shame about the service. Moment I got there i didnt have the best of service, it was booked under my brother for a birthday present and unfortunately they couldn't get there head around it for a while. They mentioned that the room would be availabel for 3pm and I could use the facilites, such as the sky park. The sky park is amazing, would definitely recommend anyone staying in singapore to stay one night to experience it, stay late at the poor, see the fire works at 8.30 and 9.30pm and go have dinner. we did however get an upgrade as it took no 3pm but to 5pm to get the room. The suite was out of this world and truly amazing, so thank you. But my buggiest let down was having a chicken club sandwich ( got sick of asian food after 2 weeks) which wasn't one and subsquently have food poisioning all nights :( horrible.",111
MBS,2,“Service standard lapsed”,"Previously my guests received good hospitality from the hotel's Premium team and decided to come back again this June. But this time, Front Office, Duty Manager, Mr Jeremy Cheah informed that they \no longer\"" provide this service due operational constraints and the last visit was made out-of-good will?!He add on further that only guests arrives in the hotel limo is entitled to services rendered from Premium team - irregardless of the room type booked?!I do hope the hotel should maintained the service level and strived to keep in consistent otherwise parallel and not offerred as one-off basis. More efforts should be put forward to entice guests to return to the hotel.""",60
MBS,3,“Amazing Pool”,The hotel itself is just one of your average big hotels. Service is very run of the mill. Efficient but not exceptional. Very typical of a huge hotel. The only saving grace is the pool at the rooftop. I am sure you have heard of this repeatedly and thankfully its heated already. Rooms are average - clean and not bad.,61
MBS,3,“$$$$$$$$$$$”,"Bring a B I G credit card !! Pool and view are nice. Casino IS T I G H T....stay off of their machines. Put $20 and get VERY LITTLE PLAY. Machine then wants more money =(. Staff ACTS professional, but many seem like they are only there because its a job. NOT concerned about your needs or complaints......\we don't care\"".""",225
MBS,3,"“Large, impersonal hotel lacking in character or service”","From the outside, the hotel is striking and definitely a new landmark for Singapore. Located next to the convention center and Gardens on the Bay, the hotel has access to a huge shopping mall and casino.However, the hotel, comprising three towers, can be quite difficult to navigate. The taxi dropped us off at Tower 1 where we checked in - but our room was in Tower 3, which required a good 10 mins walk across a busy and cavernous lobby. The lobby was full of people - some staying at the hotel, but most were passing through from the shopping mall and casinos below. There was only one cafe catering to all three towers which made breakfast a nightmare.The hotel rooms were nicely furnished and of a decent size. The rooftop infinity pool is highly over-rated. The pool spans almost the length of the three towers but is very narrow - making it very difficult to swim. Most guests were just standing in the water or lying around the edge. The jacuzzi tubs were small and during our visit, were taken up by whole families of kids, parent and grandparents which made them very unwelcoming. Service at the hotel was minimal as you never anyone around to help except at the Tower 1 and Tower 3 entrances. Overall, we did not enjoy our stay here.",108
MBS,3,“Average Hotel”,"The Hotels greatest selling point is the pool on the roof which is excellent and well worth spending some time there watching Singapore from above. You have to be a resident to use it!The rooms are good with nice furniture, lovely bathrooms and fantsatic view.The one down side is the size Booking in and out, you are always in a queue..although there are many staff on duty it does take a long time in and out and not cheap..You can wander around the hotel and the vast reception feels like a shopping arcadeA nice hotel,a great experience but too big and impersonal...done it once ( tick), not again..!",431
MBS,3,“Amazing 5 Star Hotel with 1 star service”,"We stayed at Marina Bay for 3 nights for the Formula 1 weekend. The hotel itself is undeniably an amazing thing to see. The Architecture and size of the place is incredible. The rooms are typical of 5 star far eastern standards. Large rooms with nice modern decor and amenities. The Skypark was the sole attraction for us when we made our booking. The prospect over taking a dip over the edge of marina bay was too good to miss and it really didn't disappoint. As some previous reviewers have stated it can get overly busy with kids and sometimes can seem more like a theme park but this didn't detract us. It’s one of the main attractions not just in the hotel but in Singapore so you should be prepared for this. The big (and I mean big) let down for us was the staff and service. Check in took 50mins and when we arrived at Lobby 1 we only had 3 people in front of us. How can it possibly take this long? On the Saturday we arrived back from qualifying to get ready for dinner, however we couldn't access our room because the battery in the door unit had failed. I understand things like this happen and I would not hold it against the hotel. However, nearly an hour later we were still standing outside our door waiting! When they finally arrived we had no apology from maintenance or management, which was really poor. Our worst experience came on the last day when we decided to have lunch at the pool bar. After being seated and waiting 15minutes for a drink the waiter finally took our order. 70mins later we were still waiting for food to arrive. We had notified our waiter twice in the meantime that we were still waiting on our food. In the end we just go up and walked out. Once again no apology followed. We are an average easy going couple and it takes good reason for us to complain. We were paying nearly £300.00 British Pounds per night to stay at the hotel and we really expected much more. We are still glad we stayed for the experience but we don't plan on returning in the future. I believe the sheer volume and size of the hotel is almost its downfall because the staff at times just can’t cope with number of guests. It just seems so disjointed and unorganised. Thankfully the location and architectural beauty of the hotel is what’s likely to continue to draw guests to stay year after year.",145
MBS,3,“A very average hotel that is definitely overpriced!”,"This hotel earns its prestige and status through its infinity swimming pool and ridiculous price tag. Take the sky park pool away and I think not many people will pay for either just the room or service. We were lucky enough to get a premier room for 2 nights and although the room size was generous and the bedding was luxurious, the workmanship of some fixtures was poor. The bathroom was huge with a very lovely bath tub and the view from the pool was top class. That is about as good as it gets.Service level is mediocre, food and drinks are atrociously expensive, hotel lobby is constantly busy with people who think they are a notch above others and the place is also filled with running kids. Could easily mistaken this for an amusement centre. Done it once and will not be back again!",296
MBS,1,“Not that great for the price they charged/ go check the view with out stay.”,"Fly back from Paris to Australia in Jun 2014; before I my trip I have contact with this hotel via email regarding to the early check in service. I explained to them the flight will arrive 6am in the morning after 13 hours flight, I would like appreciated if I can have early check in or alternatively I can book one more day to hold he room to ensure it will be ready for me on arrival. The reply was: it's ok if have room available for early check in service.After I arrive and waiting in the lobby with many people waiting just like supermarket for 20 mins. They told me my room will be only available until 3pm. I been told it was fully booked since they got conference. I believe on the time I email with the hotel .. They should advice me it was conference ahead and I can book one more day to avoid this happen. And I ask the reversion people give me the customer service department's contact which I can providing some feed back. Which I been told : I should contact Agoda since I didn't directly booked with the hotel. How ridiculers that was ?! After four hours waiting which I been told my room is ready! I still have to wait around 30 mins to get my key coz so many people in the queue! And my suitcase been sent to my room after 1 hour I check in to my room. For the price they charged and with the service they are providing was make me so disappointment. You can see in the morning for breakfast caffe worse than a food court. I suggest people go visit this place for the view, but not stay with them!",143
MBS,3,"“Great room, view & gym: but its like staying in a mall”","This was one of the best views imaginable and room facilities were excellent. The staff are nice, having to deal with such large crowds. The gym, on the 57th floor has great staff, more great views, and all the equipment you could want. All those things are great. But, this was like staying in a mall (which of course it is linked to). The lobby area is a 500 meter stretch of noisy overcrowding, you queue for breakfast which you eat with 400 other people and so on. Its like you never left the airport. So, if you want a great room and facilities right on top of the MRT and you don't mind the price tags, this is a good choice. If you want a more personal experience closer to the feel of Singapore's communities this is not the hotel for you.",101
MBS,1,“Overpriced”,"Visited the Marina Bay Sand Hotel in Singapore tonight, it looks great from the outside but what a disappointment on the inside. Three of us had drinks at the Ku De Ta Bar on the 57th floor total cost for 3 drinks was SIN $92.98, 1 Pinot Grigio, 1 Louis Brut Champagne and 1 Bacardi Rum. Service and ambience were non existent and no seating to enjoy the view.The hotel lobby could be any cheap hotel in the world and again no seating. This place is just built to take your money off you. My recommendation - don\t waste your money.""",190
MBS,3,“Stunning views - overcrowded and cattle management”,"The appearance of the hotel is amazing. Interesting archtecture and stunning views from the rooms and the pool deck.However the check in experience was poor - long wait in line and when I got to my assigned tower (one of three), I saw a completely free check in desk with 4 staff doing nothing.Breakfast was a joke with long queues to get into the restuarant and longer queues for the buffet counters - ugh! Not what you need to start the day. Staff were friendly enough.Bad eaperience at the pool deck restuarant where they simply forgot our food order. After an hour's wait and our query, food came and the hiccup was handled well by the oulet manager - so crisis management was good.Prices of food and beverage are high, even by Singapore standards.If you want to do laps in the pool, go early (0600 hrs) as it gets very crowded.My impression was of a five star hotel, catering to vast tour groups from Asia, with no attention to individual service.Glad I stayed for the experience of being in a Singapore landmark, but would not choose to use it again.",96
MBS,3,“Come here for the location and experience outside the room”,"The location of the hotel, and its environ of a huge mall and wonderful skypark makes for a good stay. Room wise, nothing much extraordinary, but the bathroom is great. One flaw that I've experienced is that the air-conditioning of my room was terrible. Terribly warm albeit being set at its coldest setting. Being a large hotel, check in demands a bit of patience. Service is not good though, I've requested an extra bed first thing I entered my room through the phone but the bed did not arrive until I called housekeeping again at night.",119
MBS,3,“Too much flash not enough customer service.”,"The hotel is magnificent to look at, the pool has the best view of Singapore but the hotel lacks warmth and charm that you find I many of the fine hotels in Singapore. Our room was huge but the TV did not work for 2 days. Breakfast buffet was good but nothing special. The room rate was expensive but it was hard to justify as the service was always just lacking. Location is ok but I prefer being closer to the action in town. It seems many of the staff have been imported and do not understand what a 5 star hotel should be. More training is required. One night would have been enough to just see the view.",342
MBS,1,“Must avoid. Can not believe what happened to me??”,"I checked in yesterday, after terrible experience, I arrived like 1:30 pm, waited for my turn in the queue, then the female receptionist told me that only have room in the second floor?? Although I did the booking ahead of good time and stated clearly my needs from higher floor , once view to the most important one the quiet one as I m very lite sleeper. She asked me to go for one hour and a have then to come back so maybe they finish cleaning another room. I did that then I came back waited again in the tiring queue, then received the horrible news that again only that room is available and i waited for nothing??!!! I told her can't be and I seriously started to think about canceling the booking and go to another hotel, she asked her supervisor, who offered me to stay in that room in second floor till change it later, I agreed because I was extremely exhausted, I went to that room, it was facing the highway road, very very noisy. I couldn't sleep or rest, just stayed there waiting the change. They called me after more than an hour that another room is ready and sent somebody helped me to transfer, he was surprised as he said that the room we are going to it is ready since more than 2hours!! The other room is in the 32 floor, less noisy from the road but facing the sea not the marina as I requested and each time I need to go to the swimming pool I need to change the left at floor 34. I called the express service and told her how much time I wasted in the room problem and I waited twice for nothing and I was not happy at all, she said will let the front dest talk with me, but nobody called!! moreover the AC is so noisy so till now 4:20 am I'm still can't sleep and so stressed out, that's why I'm writing now this review..",408
MBS,3,"“Beautiful Rooms, not-so-beautiful Service”","I am quite torn on this hotel, to be completely honest. The design of the hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms are spacious, BEAUTIFUL and complete with a luxurious bathroom and balcony, perfect for watching the Singapore Skyline, or even better, fireworks, when it's around National Day around here. I would definitely want to come back for the classy design of the hotel, and the spa-like feeling you get just soaking in the atmosphere of the room.However, I feel that the service of this place completely contrasts the elegant set-up. Most of the people I have encountered who work in the hotel, whether it's the bellhops or people manning the front-desk, have a rude devil-may-care attitude, which, shoot me if I'm wrong, is completely NOT right for the service industry at all! I could look past that if the service was at least efficient, but it seems that everything from checking-in to getting our rooms required long delays and impatient looks from the people \helping\"" us get the rooms ready. Even when it was time to leave, we had to wait for ages for the valet to bring us the car. I can understand why the management might think that a valet system would be better, but the truth is, it holds up the traffic, and makes it extremely inconvenient to travel there by car, or taxi, and let's be honest, nobody wants to haul their luggage on the MRT station all the way to Marina Bay! Also, while it is linked to the nearby MBS mall, there is a problem with accessibility, especially when it comes to the night time. It is a casino destination, so one would think there would be more places nearby to cater to the midnight snackers, even a 7/11 or McDonalds would suffice, nobody is asking for gourmet filet mignon here. However, there is just one or two little dim sum stores that close around midnight that are quite a reasonable distance away from the hotel, which makes the whole arrangement a lot more inconvenient.Given the price of the accommodations and food, as well as the lack of surrounding amenities other than high-end designer shops, in addition to the poor quality of service at MBS, I would say the gorgeous rooms just aren't worth it. I might almost shed a tear about not coming back to the beautiful rooms, if I didn't feel so stranded every time I did stay there.""",372
MBS,1,“The worst hotel experience I ever had”,"I stayed in MBS about two weeks ago, and had the worst experience and met very strange customer service.We enjoyed the view and the famous skypark pool, and the problem started around 11pm. Me and my friend were away from the room only for 15 minutes, and when we came back to the room, the door was locked by chain which means locked from inside. We were very scared and went to receiption and informed them the situation, and they asked us to wait for someone in front our room. After minites we got a staff and he said he is also wondering how the door can be locked by inside as the only explanation can be thought is there is someone inside. He called a tech and we waited very long for the tech in front of the door, and the tech came and open the door. The next action they took suprised me, they told us 'now you can get in and check the room.' so we had to get into the room first and checked the room if there is someone inside. And no one found. Then the staff and tech left very quickly leaving the door unfixed. After that, we found we cannot lock the door by inside anymore so we had to call the tech again to fix the door. We had to call customer service 3 times to change our room and send a tech to fix the door, as the lock still remain mystery we were very scared and uncomfortable even tho no one found from the room, and we did not feel safe and we treat it as a securety issue. No one explained why the door was locked by inside and we had to stay outside for about one hour waiting for the tech, and no one apolozied for the inconvenience we had to take. We finally could change the room around 2am in the morning. I can say it was the most terrible hotel experience I have ever had. This is what I had to deal after paying 500 SGD and it was such a disappointment to my friend from Japan who was very excited and expecting fun holiday in the MBS.",248
MBS,3,"“Stunning architecture, to which end?”","This contemporary icon needs to be seen. Architecturally, the complex demands your attention, and when you ascend to the roof garden on the 57th floor, you sense that a future has arrived. Rightly positioned, your camera captures the infinity pool, the industrial harbour, and the financial district all at once: what Singapore was, what she became, and what she now wants to be. The city-State has become rich by servicing foreign ships, foreign capital, and now the Chinese from China and Indonesia. And this is one hotel they do contribute generously to. The roof garden, large rooms, and perhaps easy access to an enormous casino pull people -- and money -- to Singapore. Weak shower pressure and low-quality bathroom products do not deter. Here is what I made of this: It gives a glimpse of Singapore's future, as many there would welcome it. But I asked myself how long the Chinese from China and Indonesia will prefer to bring and spend their money outside their countries as they currently do. And how far Singaporeans will go to cater to foreign money. A warning needs to be made to parents: If you visit the hotel's SkyBar on level 57 at night, partially outdoors and impressive, you may witness how prostitution and cocaine pass openly under the nose of the complicit staff, as I saw, and have seen at other similar packed establishments in Singapore. I wonder if this is how Singapore will become one of the world's great cities.",67
MBS,3,"“Great location, good staff, average food!”","Marina Bay Sands is a great facility with views overlooking the whole of Singapore. It is quite breathtaking. The staff were very friendly and approachable, however they seemed to be a bit reserved and not too social. The food was average for a 5* hotel. We weren't impressed, and the desserts were well below average. Great facility to sleep in, swim in, but not to eat in!",65
MBS,3,“good for gamblers”,"Nice hotel , but location wise , properly good for gamblers, rooms are average, maybe the amazing thing about the hotel is its swimming pool, in the top of the hotel The area around the hotel is in an expensive area , shopping mall and restaurants around it is very expensive , you can get the same food in Clarke Quay with a good price",377
MBS,3,“Don't Bother”,"I stayed here for 6nights for work. As a starting point don't underestimate how big this hotel is. The negatives of this are that the rooftop pool which is very nice is ridiculously busy, at any given point there are easily 50 + people lingering around the reception. If I was on holiday, I would stay somewhere else, This place sadly doesn't have a relaxing vibe.On the plus, I stayed in a king size room which was lovely. If you ask for a view facing the marina you may also be lucky enough to have a little balcony. Not big enough to lounge on but nice to go out and see the view. Room size was good, bathroom came with a nice walk in shower and big free standing bathtub.The gym is first class, fully equipped cardio and weight room. However once again you get the sense that not much common sense went into thinking about this as when you get to the changing rooms, they are worn down, have prominent mould everywhere and bizarrely for a hotel that has 2500 plus rooms there are two changing room spaces and two hairdryers! Added to the fact if you want to do a yoga class that is an extra $19.RestaurantsWe ate at ku de ta which is on the rooftop, stunning views, good food, however be warned that you have to spend a minimum of 80 Singapore dollars per person. Sky 57 is the opposite side of the rooftop and we had drinks there. Nice but like much of the hotel is extremely busy and not really the relaxing experience I was hoping for.During my trip, I also visited colleagues who stayed at The Fullerton which is about 15mons walk away. Much nicer and calmer, with a rooftop pool albeit not on the 57th floor and as an added bonus you can use all the facilities at The Fullerton Bay which is next door and a modern hip hotel with an amazing bar.Net net, if you are staying for a day or two especially for work Marina Bay Sands is fine but for a holiday, if you like feeling like you are not one of 10million people staying at the hotel, I would advise you stay somewhere else.",92
MBS,3,“Living the high life…with the tourist masses”,"Iconic property and the rooms are great - huge, well-equipped etc. Downer for this property is that it is a convention/group hotel and also popular with tourist groups so the gorgeous infinity pool on the rooftop is always mobbed from dawn till dusk, and feels more like a public swimming baths than the highest infinity pool in the world and a 'luxury' destination. Staff in all departments are super friendly and always ready with a smile. Stay downtown to soak up the Singapore vibe but visit MBS for a sundowner for sure..",2240
MBS,2,"“Room wasn't ready, keycards didn't work, toilet turned into a water fountain, and the waitress who ruined our stay!”","Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore – The World’s most expensive Building.We'd booked a Premier Room with City View to enjoy after a tour of Asia which we did with our 21 month old daughter, arriving at Marina Bay Sands after a delayed flight from Thailand to discover a long check-in queue.We then opted to upgrade to a club room so we could get in the priority queue and assumed we'd be settled in quicker.AFTER we paid for the upgrade, we were told that our club room wouldn't be ready for another hour but we’d be able to enjoy afternoon tea in The Club on level 57, provided my husband changed his singlet and sandals.We lingered around outside the toilets and porters entry while they took their time locating and returning to us our luggage so we could change, and then headed to The Club for an hour and enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea among at least a half a dozen other guests wearing singlet’s and sandals. After finally receiving our room cards, settling into our room and then changing into swimmers, we headed for the roof. The cards we were given failed to take us up and instead took us straight to the ground floor and unfortunately and embarrassingly, we were forced to walk through a tourist packed lobby in our swimmers and luckily for me, a hotel robe, accompanied by an agitated and screaming toddler that drew plenty of attention to us while we demanded cards that actually worked! I lined up again in the “priority” queue before finally being met by a lovely and professional receptionist who apologised profusely before issuing us new cards and accompanying us to the roof to insure they worked properly.After our swim, we returned to The Club for drinks and canapés. We ordered a drink each for us, a sprite which we water down for our daughter and an iPad as there was an article being published in NZ I was hoping to read. When our drinks and iPad didn't arrive I went up to the bar to order them myself. While I was at the bar, a horrible waitress began pestering my husband about closing time (it was 6:30pm, the club closes at 7), and as I sat back down to our table, the first round we ordered finally arrived, followed shortly after by the second round. Within 20 seconds, the same horrible waitress stormed over to our table and abruptly blurted out \Hotel Policy! Only one alcohol allowed on the table at a time! So, I'm taking these!\"" Before picking up a mixed grey goose and our daughters sprite and storming off, leaving 3 alcoholic drinks behind!? Firstly, we understand and respect the hotels policy, we didn't want 4 drinks anyway, and we only ordered the two extra assuming our first order had been forgotten about. Secondly, I had no problem with her taking the other two alcoholic drinks off the table, what I have a problem with, was how she did it. Her horrible and incredibly unwelcoming demeanour, and the fact she took our daughters drink instead! I asked again for the IPad, couldn't find the article I was looking for and with the horrible waitress storm trooping about, we left the club in disgust, and headed for dinner. We returned at 10pm with a sleeping toddler and were excited to finally get some rest ourselves. However, when I walked into the bathroom to prepare for bed, I was met with a flood of water from a toilet that now doubled as a water fountain! It was revolting! Throwing down towels to prevent it reaching the carpet, I called for assistance immediately.Finally after half an hour, two additional phone calls, and with the toilet still gushing, a handyman arrived, rang the doorbell, woke our daughter and finally stopped the flood. He said a cleaner would be up shortly and left. The cleaner finally arrived to find our door wide open so he could forgo ringing the doorbell, but entered with his radio on loud and subsequently woke her again anyway. He soaked up the floor with towels, replaced the ones used and left! I was angry! I called and demanded a manager and asked how she'd feel, walking on a floor that had just been covered in toilet water and not even disinfected! She returned with the cleaner, had him disinfect the floor properly, offered us a later check out so we could sleep in (as it was almost midnight), and set a meeting for 10:30am, with a Services Manager to go over all the issues we'd faced since check in.We were woken after midnight by the phones in our room. After all the headache with the toilet, a hotel staff member called our room, said hello, put us on hold and then hung up. While my husband put our daughter back to sleep, I called the manager and begged to be left alone. We were exhausted and having paid upwards of $750 for the night, we felt we were entitled to an undisturbed sleep at the very least. After rising at 9:30am and despite paying extra to be guests at The Club and enjoy the buffet breakfast, we were forced to wait in a crowded door way with 6 other \""Club and Suite Guests\"" for a table to become available. It hit 10:15am, and anticipating a meeting at 10:30am to discuss our already poor experience during our stay - I’d had enough!Spending 20 minutes in a doorway with other angered guests is not what we had envisioned from such a prestigious and iconic hotel. It also sent my husband in search of a hotel phone to reschedule the meeting for 11am, just so I could sit down and enjoy breakfast as opposed to rushing it down. Explaining all of this to the Services Manager, she offered a range of solutions and again, apologised for all the issues. Exhausted and disappointed, I was thankful for her professionalism and assurances that our experience was rare. We accepted her offer and decided to move on and enjoy the rest of our last day in Singapore. Later that evening, we returned to our room with an hour to spare before check out and decided to return to the club for a snack before our departure. There were ice buckets containing cans of soft drink surrounding the buffet. Noticing the bar was closed and like many others, we’d assumed we had to get our own drinks. I picked up a can of sprite and headed towards our table, when suddenly a hand reached out and snatched it from me! I looked up to find the same horrible waitress from the day before, saying with the same abrupt manner used previously, \""Those drinks are not for you! They are for our mixers! I've already ordered you a sprite!\"" I was both disgusted that she'd snatched from me and puzzled as I hadn't even seen her that day so how could I have ordered a sprite? I looked over at my husband and he said to her \""No you haven't\"" She spat back \""Yes I have! I ordered a beer for you and a sprite for your wife!\"" He said from his seat at the table (and quite calmly, to his credit) \""You ordered a beer for me and a sprite for our daughter, you haven't ordered anything for my wife\"" She looked at us with a sour face and said \""Well I'll order two sprites and one beer then!\"" Before storming off to the bar, placing the order and storming back to our table and saying \""I've ordered them\"" and then storming off again. My husband explained how he too had grabbed a can of sprite, assuming that's why they were around the buffet and she’d snatched off him as well. With that, I was beyond disgust with this woman, and we asked to be moved to the other side of the club where she wasn't serving. We couldn't understand why she’d been horrible to us for not one, but two days. When we arrived on the opposite side of the club, we noticed that the only people to be sat on that side, had come from Australia (we're actually kiwis that live between NZ and Australia, but it's not easy to tell the difference unless you've spent time in either country). There was a group from Sydney, a couple, and young family from Perth, as well as us - we have an apartment on the Gold Coast. This may have been a coincidence but I couldn't help thinking that perhaps our background was a factor in her decision to treat us so poorly. Either that or perhaps it was because, despite living comfortably, we come from humble and hardworking backgrounds and we live quite casually, especially on holiday and prefer people, places and experiences over designer threads and appearances and this experience is one that's left us scarred!Sadly, when we are asked about our tour of Asia and our stay at the most iconic building in Singapore, it is this particular Waitress that sticks out as the sore thumb that taints the memory of an otherwise fabulous trip. Even despite the other issues we faced at the Marina Bay Sands, which management were quick to resolve with us, the unwelcome and uncomfortable service delivered by this women has us questioning whether to return to such a beautiful hotel again?Our review…The good: The Marina Bay Sands is beautiful. The pool is amazing, a little overcrowded, but still amazing, and the food was wonderful! The management staff are no doubt well educated and experienced in the high standards of Asian Hospitality, even though certain other staff don't appear to be.The room we had, despite the issues, was gorgeous and well equipped with a double vanity in the bathroom and comfortable bed in the living area. The view of the city was superb.The bad: Aside from everything mentioned above - The first thing I noticed in the bathroom was the fingerprints all over the mirror. The second thing, was in the toilet where the wall meets the door frame, was a whole bunch of builders scribble. Not a big deal, but not something you'd expect in a Club Room of the World’s most expensive building. Our room had a distinct and strong smell of men's aftershave or cologne and this, combined with the fingerprinted mirror and toilet water/towel incident, left me questioning the standards of the hotels cleaners. The check in time and queues aren't the best, considering what the hotel charges per night.A lot of the staff are incredibly stiff, not the slightest bit welcoming and lacking that distinct service with a smile.The horrible waitress, a short woman, with cropped hair and a distinct red bindi between her eyes, dented all the resolutions reached by ourselves and the service managers, the result of her horrible attitude and abrupt behaviour, that I liken to an angry, washed up, boarding school matron! She also appeared to bully other staff. Recommendations to future guests: The Marina Bay Sands is beautiful and I'm sure the majority of the issues during our stay were rare and management seemed more than willing to address any issues that may arise, but if you're looking for a more welcoming and comfortable experience, I might recommend somewhere else. We had friends in Singapore at the same time as us that stayed at the Pan Pacific and said the service they received was the best in Asia, a far cry from our experiences. The pool and club really are the main draw cards, however with them being consistently packed and having to queue for breakfast in the doorway in a fashion, similar to waiting anxiously for food at a soup kitchen, and then, in addition to this, the experiences with the world's most horrible waitress, at the world's most expensive building… I'd say it's not really value for money, especially if you part with several hundred or thousands of dollars, only to be made to feel uncomfortable and be treated poorly? If you do decide to stay here, try and get a room in tower one or on the highest levels as to avoid having to change lifts to get to the roof. Also, pay for your deposit and room at check-in, with cash! The hotel blocked the cost of the room and deposit from my credit card when I checked-in and then at check-out they charged the room and incidentals costs (mini-bar, phone calls etc.) to my card again and I was told it takes 14 days for the original charge to be released. Not a major inconvenience, but many reviews I’ve read have sited that they’ve had to fight for months to get the money unblocked. I hope I don’t end up in that category! Recommendations to the hotel: Pull your staff into line! Waitresses should not be mistreating guests and cleaners should not be leaving fingerprints on bathroom mirrors, nor should they think mopping up toilet water with towels is sufficient enough to be deemed clean!Further to this, staff should not be calling a room with two phones and a sleeping toddler with exhausted parents, after midnight!If your staff had their act together, your managers wouldn’t need to be on damage control.“They may forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.” Carl W. Buechner""",134
MBS,3,“This is not “a hotel with a swimming pool” but “a swimming pool with a hotel””,"Living in Singapore, this hotel is too close to feel like staying, but every one of our friends abroad asks us what this hotel is like, so we decided to stay at this hotel.We had to conclude that this hotel is not a hotel. It’s “a swimming pool with a hotel”, not “a hotel with a swimming pool”. The service policy seems “unattending”. At hotels whose room charges are as high as this hotel’s, we can expect to be “attended” but they basically leave guests alone. The room are just average, you could expect much better rooms for the charge. If you are interested in the too famous swimming pool, it’s worth staying. After all, the swimming pool is fabulous. We would prefer staying at Ritz-Carlton and have a good view of this hotel.",215
MBS,3,"“Expensive with no class, but the pool is cool”","Stayed here for 2 nights, simply to check out Sky 57 and the pool. The rooms were void of character and reminded me of something from Las Vegas - grand, generic and overhyped. The first night we were upgraded to a suite - while grand and vast, we actually preferred our City View Deluxe room the next night. It was more cozy and looked out onto the city, whereas the suite looked out onto the harbour. All in all, the rooms are very forgettable and are starting to show age. The breakfast buffet at Rise, while again huge, wasn't particularly memorable either and cost SIN$48 per person. I'd describe the hotel as expensive with no class, unlike for example The Fullerton Hotel across the marina, which oozes sophistication even as you walk in. But the sky-high pool was what we came for and predictably it was the cool part. There's just something about floating at the edge of the 57th floor, so it's worth it to stay here once just to experience this (as the pool is for hotel guests only). However, now that we ticked this one off our bucket list, there are many nice hotels in Singapore and when we return for the third time (we love the city!) we will stay elsewhere.",123
MBS,2,“Disappointing”,"We were looking forward to staying here given its reputation. The size of the hotel itself was impressive, but the rooms were disappointing. For the price we paid, we were expecting a much bigger room. The price did not include breakfast, but we were hoping the room and the amenities would make it worth it. Unfortunately, we were wrong. The room looked a bit old. The bathroom door did not have a lock. The pool was nice and was the highlight of the hotel, but that's about it. The lobby and the pool were both teeming with people, so it wasn't very relaxing. If you're thinking of splurging on this hotel, I advise against it. You're better off staying at a newer hotel.",188

For a hotel of this category I was very very disappointed. Will not recommended.",202
MBS,3,"“Overcrowded, great view in general”","I went there with my wife for a stay-cation to celebrate our wedding anniversary a few years back. Our expectation is to have a quiet and romantic holiday during our stay. One of the most famous attraction of this hotel is their infinity pool, we did some research and saw how wonderful the design was, how clean and classy it looks like. But when we went to the pool, it was a disaster. The pool was overcrowded, I'm not sure how this happens but it seems like everyone went there at the same timing as us. We can't find any seat to put our stuff, a lot of people went inside the pool without a proper swimming attire, and it kinda turn me off....We ended up spending most of our time in the room instead.To be fair, the hotel has a very nice room, it was clean and tidy. The view from the room was fantastic as well. But considering that we didn't really had the chance to enjoy the pool, I really feel that we are a bit disappointed. This is a subjective feedback, I think. I'm not pretty sure what can be done to make the pool less crowded anyway...",147

MBS,1,“Spectacular hotel but MBS you wrecked the memories”,"The overall rating applies only to the administrative issues I've experienced Twice I’ve visited now and twice there’s been an administrative problem. This time I was invoiced for 2 nights, not the 1 that I booked.MBS’s fault.The staff members I’ve dealt with have been very attentive and courteous but no one has actually done anything to find out what went wrong, fix the problem and then contact me.By the way MBS i DID complete the customer satisfaction survey you sent and had some things to say but have had no contact from you. I’m the one that has had to provide emails to substantiate my claims.I’m the one that has had to spend my time trying to rectify a mistake that I didn’t make (45 minutes on check in, ½ an hour on checkout) and then no follow up until I provided the email chain 3 days later.At this stage I still suspect that I have not received my full refund but only because I haven’t had the time to follow up yet.WOW!!; Anyway on my budget this hotel is luxury with a luxury price tag(about $400 per night) but you can easily justify the cost because there’s a WOW factor with this place. It looks spectacular on the outside AND on the inside and with the use of the Infinity pool on the 57th floor(exclusive to guests) and the Observation Deck (also at no cost as a guest) you can use both of these vantage points for day and night shots of a breathtaking view(pick a clear day!!).Food; there are plenty of eating options in and around the hotel. There are great quality restaurants with an International menu available, as well as café style. If you want to eat “local” then try Lau Pa Sat with plenty of eating options from a number of countries. As with most destinations in Singapore it’s not going to take long to get there and Taxis are really cheap. Taxis are also heavily regulated so there’s always a meter running and you won’t get ripped off.Breakfast at RISE Restaurant IS SANDSational.It’ll cost $40 AUD pp but it’s worth every cent for the experience. The biggest choice I’ve seen anywhere including 3 cooking stations, all cooking to order. That’s in addition to the most enormous buffet selection I’ve EVER seen.If I’m right I think that the restaurant and kitchen staff number at around 140, so food is fresh and dirty crockery disappears very quickly.Rooms; quiet. A good size, about 28 square metres but this time we scored one with a balcony that overlooked The Gardens, which are spectacular. Floor to ceiling glass makes the room very light.There’s free in-room wi-fi internet.The hotel is centrally located and has easy access to the airport, either by taxi or the MRT across the road.",107

My second stay - forced by a business convention - and hopefully my last.The building may be iconic and the rooftop swimming pool and view \awesome,\"" but do not be fooled by photos of it with a glamorous, bikini-clad beauty lounging by the pool with a Margarita.

MBS,3,"“Amazing views from the pool deck, but overpriced and food below par”","We stayed at MBS for two nights in April in a Deluxe Double Room.The infinity pool and the views from the pool deck were amazing, but given the premium prices charged to stay here and the food and beverage quality and prices, we wouldn't do it again.What we liked about MBS:- Very comfortable bed, well fitted out and clean rooms with excellent noise proofing and black-out blinds- Spectacular views from the pool deck and the pool being open until 11pm every night- Track your hotel bill and check-out via your in-room TV - very convenient and avoids queuing up to check out but still allows you to approve your final billAnd the downsides:- Very busy, especially the pool area - full of people taking photos of the views and of themselves by the infinity pool. It was difficult to get chairs by the pool around breakfast time - early morning, although by mid-morning there were more chairs available as presumably people left to sightsee.- Expensive room rates, and despite high room rates many of the options DON'T include breakfast- Our room had a large balcony but there was no furniture on it- The mini-bar has electonic sensors and charges you for items if you simply lift them out of their designated spaces. This stops you putting your own items in the minibar (as I pointed out to them, even medication and the likes). We resolved this by having the staff come to our room and clear out half the mini-bar (and presumably de-activate those sensors) so that we could put our own drinks in there, which was great and allowed us to drink our own wine and beer and avoid their ridiculous prices.- Very expensive drinks prices on the pool deck and in the mini-bar.- Food was below the range and quality we expected: (i) the poolside menu is quite limited - we only had one meal there (hamburger) and it was very average (ii) we didn't have breakfast included in our room rate so we went up to the pool deck - the restaurants that served eggs etc were only open to certain guests (club guests from memory??), so we went to the other restaurant and found the service average and the menu quite limiting - e.g. the menu lacked the standard breakfast egg options etc, and the coffee was mediocre.",312
MBS,3,“Not up to the expected standard”,"I was most disappointed by my recent stay at Marina Bay Sands. For a hotel of this class and price there is a certain standard that needs to be met, and in my experience almost always is. I was stunned to see how far short of the mark the MBS fell. The pool area is of course stunning and is the real draw card, but I can't help but think the best thing about the MBS is the view of it from another hotel. It is architecturally beautiful. But it feels more like an airport terminal than a 5 star hotel. Service is essentially non existent. The rooms are generic with nothing particularly special to note about the amenities. On check in I was handed a key with no offer to assist with my luggage or even give me basic information about the hotel such as where and when breakfast was etc. After reaching my room and finding 2 single beds instead of a king as booked I was told that was all that was available and nothing could be done. After about 20 minutes of being told there were no other rooms a king bed room was miraculously found. Instead of assisting me to move my luggage to the new room I had to lug it across myself as the staff were more interested in checking I had not removed anything from the original room! On reaching the new room it reeked of cigarette smoke (despite being a non smoking floor). Mid stay the toilet stopped flushing properly. When I brought it up staff did nothing about it. Given the premium price (over 500 AUD a night without breakfast!) the attitude of the staff was completely unacceptable. Quite a few of my colleagues stayed at the Ritz Carlton and it received glowing reports from all. Next time I will stay there.",308
MBS,3,"“An amazing overpopulated swimming pool, don't overpay for higher rooms”","It's all about the swimming pool. Expect no more, expect no less. A must do for a complete day in Singapore. Anyway, don't overpay for rooms, it's not like is worth it. Garden view is as good as city view. Floor 38 might be slightly better than floor 32 but not very. And anyway, both will feel irrelevant when you climb to the top pool, where the magic happens. Save your money for dinner, the cheapest room will do. There is not a big difference between the club rooms and the rest, either, maybe if you go for the suite... but the others we got to see them and they are pretty much the same.We booked three rooms and paid a little bit more for what was supposely a better room, city view an all, but when we arrived there they said we were rewarded with an upgrade. Also with a downgrade which they forgot to mention, only recognizing it when we pointed it to them at the front desk. They tried to make it up for us with breakfast, it's better than nothing and gave us no other option. Basically they had given our rooms to some other people and fit us wherever they could. When you fly for more than 6 thousands kilometres and pay for this sort of accomodation, it's not like getting a free breakfast makes it up for you (well, we have breakfast at home, not the city views we did paid for). So service was poor, didn't help much. We arrived late and it took us like two hours to get everything arranged. Just because they had given our rooms to somebody else, reallocating us took them certainly too long.Anyway, the pool is really amazing, we enjoyed that. But don't get high expectations on the service and don't overpay for the room.",436
MBS,1,“Double Trouble”,"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) on at least a dozen occasions. I have previously written very positively about MBS.However, my recent trip has left me a little confused!We had 2 rooms booked by our company - the rooms were paid for by our company. This must be a regular occurrence for a hotel the size of MBS. To our surprise, on arrival we were asked to pay for the rooms again and were told our company had not paid but merely \held\"" the rooms on our behalf.During the trip I decided to check with our company CEO back in the UK - had he actually paid - had the monies left his account. The answer was a straight \""YES\""Maybe we were confused - maybe the funds would be refunded back to our cards on departure - it seemed odd but not impossible. Maybe the monies taken from us were some kind of security deposit?Up-on departure, the check out assistant processed our payments with no mention of a refund back on to our cards. We waited for the customary, \""Have a nice flight\"" before mentioning the possible double payment of our account. After insisting the assistant double check, he found there had been a double payment - strange he never noticed it the first time around.Without a hint of an apology, the assistant told us he would refund the monies back to the card from which the second payment was made. This would be considered good news until he told us the transfer would take 15 days!!My colleague (the second payment was made on his card) decided to contact the hotel management directly to complain about this 15 day delay. Today is day 7 since the complaint - no reply from the management and no refund of money. We have still to receive official recognition there was a mistake made, never mind an apology which I feel we will wait a long time for.....MBS is an iconic building. It sits proudly as a modern piece of architectural genius. It is one of the most expensive buildings ever built. However, it has no right to abuse its position by not recognising, not apologising and not acting quicker to refund our money which is OURS!As a sub-plot. MBS was full for the last 3 nights of our stay and we had to stay in another 5 star hotel. If I can block the Sky Park and The Club on 57 out of my mind, the second hotel was better in every way.So in summary MBS:Recognise your mistakePlease apologisePlease refund our money todayThank-you!Philip Terry / Mark Williams""",207
MBS,2,“Marooned in Singapore”,"This complex of three hotels, casino , convention center and a huge high end mall shopping area is a huge disappointment. Unless you have the dollars of the developer/Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelman in your pocket it is no place to stay. There are miles to walk to get anywhere in the complex. All of which is enclosed space, but no real affordable places for breakfast, lunch or dinner and no direction from the hotel staff as to finding these. The architecture and surrounding massive garden is impressive, but come to just see those features. The 57th floor infinity edge pool is unappealingly crowded and drinks at the bar start in the twenties. To change money from dollars to the currency of Singapore is to face scrutiny and rejection of your bills, then be directed to walk to a currency exchange shop deep in the mall, a long walk and escalator rides away and this is for a guest staying at the hotel! There is no possibility to walk into an area nearby as an alternative to obtain items or food as this requires an expensive cab ride or navigating the subway system. There is no feeling of being in a hospitable city or hotel here!",200
MBS,3,“Just too huge”,"I stayed here for a convention located at the adjacent convention center. My conclusion is that I do not like mega hotels: It is simply too big. It's like being in a Las Vegas mega casino. My first complaint is that the sheer size makes the walks too long for doing anything. My room was in Tower 3 and the breakfast is at the foot of Tower 1 as was the entrance to the underground passage to the convention center.The rooms were fine with the views being excellent. The bathroom was spacious but the shower floor was uneven so that it left small pools of water. The amenities were high quality.During the convention, the SGD 48 price tag of the breakfast left us eating pastries and coffee at the pastry shop located directly opposite the main hall where you can have breakfast for under 10. On our last day we were able to take time to enjoy the breakfast. It was good but not outstanding. The location in the atrium makes for a rather noisy experience.Overall I understand that the reputation of this place is that it is known for its bling and flashiness rather than true quality and service.",49
MBS,2,“disappointing”,"we had three nights At Marina Bay Sands, the room was very noisy, carpet badly stained, no fresh milk for tea or coffee, the room was $500 per night. I would not stay there again or recommend this hotel to anyone. large and impersonal. just like an airport hotel.",56

MBS,3,“Excellent Property & Stunning view from Sky Pool But Poor Hospitality”,"I stayed here for one night (1st May 2014) with my family after spending 4 nights at Wangz Hotel in our recent trip to Singapore. We arrived around 2pm and luckily there was no que for check-in. However, there was no personal touch with the process. This room costed us S$626 with breakfast (incl taxes) just for 01 night and this so called 5 star property not even offered a welcome drink! They gave a small water bottle instead at the front desk! They also demanded S$200 extra as a deposit....We got a free upgraded Premier room on 9th floor Tower 2 overlooking the Shoppes Mall. The room itself is very spacious and the bathroom is also very big. However the shower was a bit sad and without a force in the water. The bathtub was a great relief. The mini bar was full and auto operated i.e. even if you just remove any item, it will be charged to your bill immediately...! So you cannot place any outside item to cool. The biggest disappointment was that they don't give any complementary extra drinking water bottle on top of the already placed 2, 500ml bottles. And the charge for extra 500ml water bottle is S$4!!! The area around this hotel is truly happening place and you can enjoy many things including Casino. The mall and 7/11 shops in it as well as the food courts are very useful.The views from the Sky Park pool are superb and stunning. The pool is very big in length but too narrow in width. On top of this, it's over crowded at all times. You cannot enjoy it fully with such a houseful crowd....The breakfast spread is simply great and it does have a separate counter for Indian food. But here also, if you want to enjoy your first meal of the day quietly, then you have to come before 8.30am. After that, you might have to be in a que for table for at least 15-30mins....! Again, due to over crowding in this Rise restaurant, you won't get any proper attention.We booked this hotel for one night just to enjoy and relax the last day of our trip before flying back to Mumbai, however they demanded us to check-out at 11am only which is just insane in my opinion. I called the front desk and they allowed (!) me to stay till 12pm mentioning that our key cards will be auto expired at 11am only....!When I compare it to the other hotel (Wangz) where I stayed for 4 nights, on hospitality, service and personal attention, I rate MBS completely negative.Overall, not a good option with such a high price...",153
MBS,3,“has a nice gimmick that's it!”,"we stayed here for one night at november - the price for the room was pricey about 350 euro per night and it didnt even included breakfast! but the online responses made it sound like you haven't been to singapore if you haven't stayed here at least one night-so we did.the truth is that the room is big - a great bad and nice service , the main attraction is the swiming pool that has a great view but you can see it almost the same if you enter the sky park the pool itself has an \adult section\"" but the pool isnt too deep - again the pool is a gimmick ...my advise is d'ont break any saving account for this because in the end its a regular hotel with a very basic pool that has a great view ... in that price you can get a better value in other hotels.""",200
MBS,3,“a pool and a room with a view but populated with guests who certainly have money but definitively no manners”,"luxury for sure but only on the surfac.The pool is beautiful but a hygiene disaster, there are no showers and adults are encouraged to have intimacy in the child free zone, while in the child zone children can misbehave and bother guests; those guests who go to the edge with their alcohol glass for having their picture taken and spill most of it on the way in the pool (if only it was champagne:); arabs allowed in their day clothes (yes no swimming costumes,but trousers and t shirts for children and burkas for the women - surely they can afford proper attire? ) surely the hotel is selling those full body covering bathing suits, the photographers have them:)Bathroom is a catastrophy, toilets are for dwarfs, no space to put your stuff on/around the sink, electic plug less than 20cm from watertap, shower door not closing. Check in was a disaster as expected.But the view, the shoppes, the casino, the restaurant, the vicinity of gardens by the bay and the MRT can not be beaten.Expect new fortunes from China, gambling Americans, not so polite Japaneses, some eurotrash and oil heirs from the Gul, with one thing in common: lack of manners!",78
MBS,3,“Only location and view”,"The best and perhaps the only good things about this hotel are the location and view. You enter the hotel and feel like a public park. No hospitality or welcomed feeling that you get at similar places. Its too crowded and too big for leisure. The rooms are almost like a 3-star (again, except the view). No doubt, the pool has the view to pay for. A no-no for a business visitor who wants quick ingress and egress.",215
MBS,3,“A hotel or a bus station?”,Yes the building is an impressive and view from the roof top is great. I stayed in the hotel when it has just opened few years ago. The rooms didn’t impress me then and from reading the recent reviews I am guessing the quality of the rooms haven’t changed much to match the dollars charged. This time I took my family to see the viewing gallery. The views are very impressive.The hotel lobby is more like a bus station with people moving in and out or just hanging around taking pictures. The infinity pool on the roof top is open only for the guests. Visitors pay a handsome price to see quarter of the floor. Then they try to sell you a pic of yourself for S$50 as soon as you enter. Don’t buy it is not worth price. I rather take a photo from outside and Photoshop the people for a fraction of the cost. The pool is beautiful but not a place to relax. It is over crowded with people taking selfies. The gifts shop at the top of the roof is equally overpriced. The postcards they sell for $2 can be bought for $0.50 in China Town.There are better hotels in Singapore. Only visit this place for the view from the rooftop.,499
MBS,3,“Stay one night for the experience”,"My husband and I stayed 3 nights at MBS in between Maldives and Tioman Island for our honeymoon. Our initial thoughts were the service was very good but the room was average and not worth the amount paid (we paid an average of S$552 inc pn inc breakfast for a basic room). When looked at from the perspective that for an extra $100-200 you could be staying in a Maldives beachfront villa with all meals and alcohol included it didn't seem like good value for money. In short if the key draw card for you is the pool, stay a night to see it then stay somewhere else for the rest which will be cheaper with better rooms. We were on level 27 and had a great view of the gardens/ocean. The room was in great condition and very clean. The highlights of the room were decent mini bar, remote controlled curtains, good amenities, king bed, nice pillows, bed a little more comfortable than most asian hotels which tend to be very hard, a big screen TV with a lot of features such as video check out and bill review. I was surprised that the room did not have a bath it only had a shower, but since reading other reviews and checking out some of the photos posted I have noted that we must have had one of the more basic rooms as ours did not even have a bath. The view from the infinity pool is quite spectacular and the sun lounge set up and service is a great touch. It is however very very busy and full of people who have splashed out for that one night to try out the pool and are taking selfies (guilty as charged but when in rome) so not a place to expect a nice quiet swim. We had to wait a long time for sun lounges at around 4pm but had little trouble get one around 9pm. Also you feel a bit like a zoo animal with all the tourists staring into the pool area from the Skypark non-guest viewing platform. We had the Rise Restaurant breakfast buffet twice, terrible value for money the food and service was average and the selection is not impressive for a hotel with such a big reputation, we did not end up trying the Sky 57 breakfast - perhaps that is better. We tried out room service the char kway teow was excellent, the club sandwich underwhelming. Casino was a let down, yet as we expected to at least be able to buy a drink. Not sure if this is the norm for Singapore casinos but its purely for gamers you have to be seated for the complimentary trolley service and it is all non-alcoholic. There is also complimentary self service of water bottles and soft drinks is a bonus. The whole Marina Bay complex is impressive hosting some big names, absolutely spotless and the light and water show was fun to watch.",392
MBS,3,"“Exceptionnal as a hotel, terrible as a staying guest”","It costs 500 USD a night, all taxes and servie calculated, and breakfast included to stay in a \Premier room\"", city view, in this futuristic spaceship. That is 1 level above the basic \""Deluxe\"" room, which only differs by 15 m2 less. Above those 2 types of room, you still have 12 extra more choices.We love :- The indescriptible magic feeling when wandering inside, under, above and around this new landmark of the state city. The skypool park is oustanding, as well as the view from the skydeck that is opened to all staying guests, using their valid room cards (strictly off limits to anyother, even if you are willing to pay). The view is stunning over the garden with its asymetric fly-eyes and the giant manga trees. It is as beautiful when night sets in by the marina side, the colorful science museum, and the bright skyline on the opposite shore. This area has replaced Singapore back to the very short list of cities of the future, definitely.We hate :- The incredible crowds the hotel has attracted. At anytime during the day, or during the night, The whole world wants to discover this unique place, so be prepare to all-time-rush-hour anywher you go. At breakfast, the rise restaurant buffet looks like a clubmed buffet fight. Check in waiting time is horrendous (we paid 500 usd a night ... That is sureley nothing ...), check out is less thanks to the check-out-angels flying around the queue with their magic machines, to quickly check out leaving guests. Then lining to leave the luggage is also depressing. Crowds fighting in and out of the lifts. The all time packed skypool is a real pain in the a... No comment.We don't like :- The premier room, though very comfortable and large, is nothing luxurious (500 usd ...)- Rise restaurant buffet breakfast choice is pretty poor compared to what we are willing to find in AsiaSo, high hope had brought us big big deception. Largely due the massive crowd that this exceptional hotel has attracted. Consequently, price so high compared to what is offered. We are very proud today to say we've been there, but we surely will not come back again. We had stayed at the Intercontinental, the Swiss, the Fullerton and the Raffles, and had a real exceptional experience at each time. Not here.""",497
MBS,1,“It could be an iconic hotel .... but it isn't. Not at all!”,"I spent one night at this hotel booked, because I was excited to see the rooftop pool and the phantastic views on the city . Due to the high price and the numerous reports in magazines and on TV - Shows my expectations were very high. First the good things about the hotel: - Access to the viewing platform is included in the room price. - The view from the top is breathtaking. - The Infinity - pool is great and the evening view on the lights of the city is a feast for the eyes. - The rooms are very large and modern. - The staff at the information desk and the concierge - service were very friendly and helpful. Things which are to improve: - The hotel is very large and has two entrances at the northern and southern end. Therefore, if you arrive at the wrong entrance, you have to cross the whole hotel to reach the right tower . The north entrance is also not nearly as nice as the southern one. - The entrance hall is very spacious and bright , but also relatively noisy. - Bad access to the MRT. - The operation of the elevators using the hotel key card is a little complicated and not easily understandable. It needs several attempts to be fully understood. Unfortunately there were some issues that are totally unacceptable for a five star hotel, especially in Singapore and at such high room rates: - In spite of my repeated request it was not possible to get my luggage immediately to the room at check in, I had to carry it myself up to my room (49th floor ! ), although I told the staff that I had to change my clothes because of an upcoming appointment and therefore the luggage was immediately needed at my room. - The air conditioning was extremely loud. In addition, every time I switched it on, the room immediately smelled of heating gas. Therefore, I couldn't use air conditioning during the night since otherwise I wouldn't have been able to sleep due to the loud noise and the bad smell. - The bathroom was not cleaned properly : There were hairs lying on the floor of the shower. - The plastic isolation of the electric wire to the kettle was partially removed and the wires were exposed . This is not just a careless mistake but a hazard for health! Absolutely inappropriate for a five-star hotel! All in all I have to say that I cannot give any recommendation for this hotel given all the deficiencies. When it comes to the view from the top, it is enough to go to the visitors platform. But an admittedly spectacular rooftop pool is not sufficient as an argument for spending so much money, just to have to accept such compromises on service, cleanliness and safety. But at least all the deficiencies can be corrected with little effort, what I strongly recommend",166
MBS,2,“Horrible Atmosphere”,"We immediately over whelmed as we walked in the entrance of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel as it is massive.We tried to check in but were told abruptly to go to the other end,(tower 3) so walked along and had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes before checking in. All the reception staff were extremely rude. They all looked exhausted and fed up.Once we made our way to our room it felt a bit calmer. The room was very clean and nice although a bit soul less.The hotel is extremely hard to navigate as if you want to go to the top floor you have to change at level 34.The buffet breakfast was very hectic, having to queue again to be seated. There is a big selection but none of the food is very appetising and looks like it has sat there for a while.The one good thing about the hotel is the pool which was good fun to swim in, although very busy!",189
MBS,3,“A once in a lifetime event”,Our travel advisor recommended that we stay here as it would be a memorable experience....and it was but not for all the right reasons. The hotel is an imposing structure with 3 towers supporting the incredible rooftop infinity pool complex which was amazing and definitely something to be experienced.Our room was ok but noisy because the walls provided inadequate soundproofing. The constant 'ping' of the lift as it travelled between floors was also clearly audible. Perhaps they should have built one tower & tripled the sound insulation but too late now!Two things remain in our memories about this hotel. Firstly it is Massive ( yes that is a capital M) so if you want to stay in a place that is the size of a small town then great but it felt TOO big and impersonal to us. Secondly do not eat here unless you want to take out a second mortgage every time you eat in one of the hotel restaurants. The prices are ridiculously high and hardly justified. It was an experience staying here but not one we will be repeating when we next stay in Singapore.,184
MBS,3,“Once in a lifetime .. And never again!”,"You have to stay at Marina Bay Sands for one night if you go to Singapore. You have to experience the pace of the lift going to the 57th floor, and the infinity pool on the 57th floor, and ofcourse the view of the City from here.. Absolutely out of this world. That aside, for the price - you are literally paying for the name and the infinity pool. We were very disappointed with our room, the staff. But we knew we were paying just for the sake of it being Marina Bay Sands. For the two nights leading up to our stay we stayed at ParkRoyal on Pickering - now THIS is luxury. For literally half the price we were treated to an amazing room, breakfast in the private Orchid Club room, all day drinks - cocktails and \canapes\"" aka a full bar and dinner at night, and cocktails and snacks at \""tea time\"" aka full bar service and divine food! And don;t have to pay for parking.... Bonus. Having said this, you have to experience the infinity pool. And that is it!""",109
MBS,3,“Infinity pool is the only worthy part of the stay”,I stayed at this hotel during my visit to Malaysia and Singapore.I chose this hotel simply because of its famous infinity pool.Well it is a great pool with stunning view (especially at night).But it is also packed with people at all time!!The management probably has to think of a way to control the guest or the visiting crowd...However if the capacity versus the capacity of the hotel has lost its balance there isn't much thing you can do about it......It made me feel like swimming in a big fish tank with so many people watching and walking by...It lost the tranquility of a pool of a 5 star hotel...,136
MBS,3,“Superb view but..”,"Had our staycation last February for our anniversary. View from room is awesome, definitely the best view in Singapore. Room is good, but nothing out of ordinary. Pool looks awesome with a great view, I believe anyone who can, should experience swimming there once in your life. But just a warning, water is damn cold from up there, and no heater even at night, so be prepared!I had an issue (not big but disappointing) though with a dining voucher they gave me. I stayed overnight during a weekend. They gave a dining voucher for 1-for-1 buffet at the Rise restaurant. But voucher can only be used during weekdays, and only if you are a hotel guest. So I am not really sure why the voucher was given at all. Cause obviously we can never use it.",93
MBS,3,"“Great room, nice rooftop view but too crowded”","Bed and room were great. I loved the bed very much, it was very comfy and I wanted to fall asleep instantly. Room facilities were good.

MBS,3,“Resort Hotel if you know what I mean!”,"Hugely impressive from the outside and foyer area then it is a matter of opinion. Brown and yellow everywhere which appears a bit shabby. Jumble of lifts to get anywhere and three towers is too much for the concierge team to manage as they declined to deliver my shopping from arrival at Tower 3 to Tower 1! Luckily am able bodied and the two boxes sat with me in the bar where I met a friend for a drink. I am sure the rest of the guests appreciated that!All very friendly but pool rather than being a delight is a bit of a bun fight even if it is a dramatic one. I liked the warning not to enter the pool with an ear discharge, boils or evident skin infections. Do their customers need to be told?",193

When checked in I was advised that this was not the case. As the web pages of the hotel were down on week 8/2014 I could not double check or proof my case? Anyway that was just the beginning. Overall check-in took time about 30 mins. Lobby was very crowded and plenty of tourists and visitors who are not hotel guests were wondering around.Room we got it was OK however the views were so and so. What I liked - building is beautifuland very special. Roof top pool area is nice to see. But all over there are far too many people.Typically in Singapore you may leave your belongings by the lounge chair when you want to have a swim or drink. On the roof top you dare not,….as there are too many people from outside.Service at the hotel at the hotel has plenty of room for improvement. I planned to stay 6 nights and left to another hotel after staying two nights.",105
MBS,3,"“Great views, decent rooms, poor service, overpriced”","The room are spacious and generally well done. The air conditioning is extremely noisy and interfered with sleep quality. The housekeeping staff was first rate. Otherwise, the service at the hotel was abysmal for a hotel in this price range. The check-in check-out lines are long and slow. The concierge folks seem disinterested in helping. All services are ridiculously overpriced and generally mediocre and poor quality. The infinity pool on the top level was nice, but missing convenient showers to rinse off. The amenities on the pool level also seemed to be overpriced and lacking in imagination and quality. Would definitely not stay here again.",197
MBS,1,“Overpriced and mediocre”,"I spend around 80 nights a year in 5 star hotels. This was my second and last stay at the Marina Bay Sands. On this occasion I was checking in at 10pm and checking out at 7am the next day so all I really wanted was a comfortable bed and a good shower. Despite booking a non smoking king room I was given the choice of a twin non-smoking room on the bottom floor or a smoking room higher up. I took the twin but was immediately confronted with the noise of 6 lanes of traffic immediately outside my room. When I asked to change to a non-smoking room away from the noise I was told that wouldn't be possible and was told to close the curtains to reduce the noise. The rooms are alreadty starting to look dated and the shower was broken and stuck on too high a temp to be able to stand. Check-in experience was slow and unfriendly. Room service breakfast was of good quality. When staying in Singapore I recommend you opt for a quality hotel in the centre of town rather than this overpriced, underserviced, already dating hotel miles from anything.",596
MBS,3,“Too big”,"We booked this hotel as others mainly because of the pool being its unique selling point, however for a 5 star hotel you would expect better customer service, but this hotel is too large to be able to provide this, even though they still charge you 5 star rates. On arrival we had to wait almost 30 minutes to be booked in. This was mainly despite the very long reception area thee were only two staff present , however just a little way down there were four staff in the club/ business reception, non of whom appeared interested in assisting their colleagues, and ushering us down to get us checked in quicker. We arrived at approx 7pm, not a peak time I suppose, but no the less, we should not of had to wait this long. We complained when we were finally attended to, this was not the fault of the staff member but when at a 5 star establishment, we normally expect quicker service. To compensate us however we were upgraded to a club room on a high floor, and provided with a late check out. Our room was with a city view as pre booked, the room was large with panoramic views of the city which was very impressive. We were disappointed that as standard the hotel only provided 2 small bottles of water, there was no information either to state if the tap water was safe to drink after boiling or not. The pool areas view vies were impressive. However the area was very busy, I guess as every one was drawn to the hotel by the pool feature. And the only way you can use it is by being a guest. We did however on both occasions manage to find beds to lie on, but would not say the area was one were you could relax, due to the numbers of people present. We also had issues with the room keys accessing the lifts as the card readers did not often read them causing us to miss our floor on a few occasions. We did not try any food within the hotel, but ate within the adjoining Mall, but again for this standard of establishment we were not too impressed the the impersonal areas especially the buffet restaurant which looked more akin to a lower market establishment. We did for a couple of times try the bar area closest to reception while waiting for friends. The drinks were not cheap s you may expect, but can't complain about the staff as the service was decent. All in all the staff were ok, but numbers of them in certain areas have to be looked at to improve service, I also had to mention to staff about the gym changing rooms which we were allowed to use after checking out for a shower owing to a late flight out, because some inconsiderate users had left towels all over the floor, and despite a staff member being in there twice he had failed to clear them. Once mentioned this was quickly rectified, but I should not have to mention it, and he should not have had to pick them up, as users of these facilities should respect them and the staff. Having stayed there, should we ever return to Singapore would we go again, well no, as for value for money, I think we would rather spend it in a smaller 5 star hotel, were you feel like your being treated as a 5 star guest and not like a guest within a budget hotel.",333
MBS,3,“Really overrated”,"Stayed in business in a Deluxe Room in Tower 3 - I was being hosted this isn't one of my standard SIngapore hotels.First impressions - a packed lobby and check-in that took 25 minutes in the queue - I've stayed in hotels all over the world, both large and small and have never been in a check-in queue like that before.Then there was the huge walk to the other side of the lobby to go into the lifts - I'm sure someone would have helped with my bag if I'd decided to also join the huge queue near the concierge desk.The room was nice but to be frank I expected a lot more. I had a nice view and small balcony out the rear of the hotel but the bed, shower, air con etc was all just average - I've stayed in a lot better.I had one drink in the lobby bar which had no real atmoshphere (although I was pleased to see I wasn't the only one subjected to massive check-in queues - it seems to be a trend).Breakfast - firstly you get to enjoy yet another queue to get in, before being seated in a large lobby based restaurant with even less atmoshphere than the bar. If I'd wanted to queue (again!!) for eggs I'm sure they would have been nice. I didn't have time to swim in the pool but I did do a quick walk by - the roof top is certainly the highlight and does have a great view. Only thinkg I noticed with the pool was there wasn't much shade if you're prone to sun burn.Check out - I could mention the queue but I'm sure you've got the point by now - anyway it was thankfully quicker then check-in.Overall - average room, terrible service and a queue for everything - I certainly wouldn't choose to stay here, there's a lot better hotels in SIN then this one - that are also a lot more centrally located.",96
MBS,3,"“Overrated, Overpriced, Excellent service though”","We stayed 2 nights at the shopping mall hotel as we called it, totally overrated and overpriced, I think their marketing budget exceeds their food budget, the breakfast on Sky on 57 was mediocre. All the so called Michelin star restaurants are in a shopping mall, the Michelin star chef whose name is attached to the restaurant is not there and according to most staff visits once in a while. Admittedly their PR machine for all these places is amazing. We definitely would never stay there again and highly likely not even visit the place again.",184
MBS,2,“Ver Poor Customer Service”,"This is a repeat visit for me. Last time the service was fantastic ans we had a wonderful stay - how mush has changed in 12 months. Despite booking (In advance) a NON SMOKING Grand Club Room, upon arrival at 8 pm, we were shown to a room that had clearly been smoked in. The stench was sooo bad, both my daughter and I instantly felt sick. I asked for a room change - to a room that was non smoking, as requested. At first, I was told that there were no other rooms available and I would have to spend the night in the room. I immediately asked for the duty manager - but was told there wasnt one available!! I went to check out and finally someone decided to try and rectify the situation. I was offered a down graded room. The overall service was terrible, with little or no concern towards customer service. This will be my last stay here - there are too many good places to stay in Singapore where they are willing to treat their guests as guests.",390
MBS,3,“A pool with an hotel”,"I had really high expectations for this hotel. We basically almost only went to Singapore just to visit it during our honeymoon. We booked a \Premier with City View\"" room. Once I booked I started receiving one email per week for special offer.I sent the hotel an email 2-3 weeks before our arrival to get something organised for my wife (like flowers on the bed even if I had to pay for it) as it was the first hotel we were visiting during our honeymoon (before leaving Singapore for Thailand). I didn't get any answer.Upon arrival at the hotel, it looked pretty nice. We checked in through the VIP desk and I asked again if something was getting organised for our honeymoon. I think it got lost in translation... Nothing got organised and I was a bit disappointed to start with...The room was pretty boring, the design wasn't special and the finish was pretty basic. The toilets light switch is located in the entry. If you wake up at night to go to the toilets, you have to go back to the entry and find the right switch (or you will wake up your loved one :/ ). It's pretty disturbing at first and gets annoying after the first time. Since we got a room near the elevator, we got woken up 2 or 3 times overnight by noisy people coming back to their rooms. Another door between the corridor and the bedroom would help. The bathroom is also really spacious.The pool view is indeed amazing, but it really feels like they build an awesome pool and put average hotel rooms under it (while keeping the prices of an awesome hotel). The retaining wall of the pool was dirty (limestone stain). The room cleaning service is opt-in, you have to call the reception to get your room cleaned. Pretty surprising for this price range.After I left, I received 2 emails to send feedback \""Your opinion is valuable to Marina Bay Sands\"" in 2 days. I filled their online survey but didn't hear anything since (6 days ago). I also emailed them on the same day to tell them all of the above but didn't get any response yet.Overall, I'm glad I did it but it was disappointing. I think they wouldn't get many clients if it wasn't for the pool.""",167
MBS,3,“Great for only the view”,"We stayed the majority of time in Singapore in Mandarin Oriental, but swapped the last night for a stay in Marina Bay Sands - to take a look at the view and the infinity rooftop pool. It was worth it because the view really was stunning, but otherwise we were rather happy that we didn't spend all of our nights here, as the approach to customers was nothing to compared to Mandarin Oriental. It is very much based on mass-tourism, reminding more a hotel in the middle of a big shopping center, there is no personal approach to the hotel customers - the check-in counter guy didn't smile even once or make us feel anyway welcome, instead he was in such of a hurry that I ended up asking him to slow down when speaking, as I didn't even get all of his words. There was no big cue behind us, so more or less seemed he just wanted to get it over with fast as possible.",321
MBS,3,“Good view but.....”,"We thought we’d get a WOW experience at this hotel, but apart from the view we were very disappointed with many other aspects of the stay. We’d just stayed in the Shangri La Valley Wing in Singapore and that was a far better experience for a lot less $. Anyway to review this hotel….. We stayed in a premier city view room which was lovely, with a beautiful bathroom but we had to pay for breakfast etc. as only the suites or club rooms had breakfast included and access to the other “club” areas and extras. We had an automatic bar fridge which had no space for you put anything else in (I had medications that needed to be kept cool) and water was $7 for a small bottle. I had to ask for shower gel twice as they weren't renewed by the cleaners. We had to queue for a table for breakfast at Rise, it was a very crowed unpleasant experience as the scrambled egg, bacon and tomato were all cold (not what you expect when you pay $41 each for the experience). I would recommend the fresh omelette that was cooked before you, as you waited, it was excellent, and there were lots of other foods on offer. I was impressed with the pool area, I thought it would be more crowded but we managed to find a spot easily. There are loungers under trees on the deck too, which are great if you want to read.The café here is a much better option for breakfast if you don’t like crowds and the view is obviously to die for. Would I go again, probably not, I would recommend everyone to stay for one night in a club room or suite just to experience it, but the experience didn't come anywhere close to the one we had earlier in the week at the Shangri La and that was far cheaper.",169
MBS,3,"“Good, but a huge disappointment”","Stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise, hotel is amazing and looks superb from the outside however its obvious behind the scenes its actually quite overrated.Check in queue took 40 minutes to get checked in. Some people took upwards of 20 minutes to be processed - what takes so long to check in?Pool area was so busy it doesn't feel like a pool but squeezed full of hundreds of people, no sun beds and people everywhere.The final straw was when we returned from dinner to find someone had been smoking in the room next to us and it had spread through the connecting door making our room stink of smoke. It took over an hour of phone calls and hassle to get moved from being told there were no other rooms, then when I threatened to leave, one suddenly became available. They refused to reduce the room price on the basis of loosing so much sleep over the hassle.All in all, its an amazing hotel, but very over-rated.",260
MBS,3,“for the money you pay not so sure”,"the staff are very polite and helpful, can be a bit forgetfull at times. The main problem here i think is that its almost too big a complex with toomuch going on in a too confused manor. There are diffrent types of rooms in the diffrent towers at diffrent levels, plus a casino and a shopping centre. This give the grand concorse a very busy and confused feel. the pool at the top has some great view, but is very crowded, if your thinging of swiming pretty much forget about it. The food in Sky on 57 is nice but is what you expect form that caliber of restaurant ( and what you can get in most top restaurants in the west - Lacked a local touch). that last part could be said for the whole resort. The rooms for the price where underwhelming and i could not work out why they did not take advantage of the view (delux room tower 3). There were time when i felt this was aim at the chinese gambling/ bit of fun crowd (which to be honsit was most of the demographic there). The spa is very good. As I say the staff where good, and even though the simles sometimes disapreaed quickly after enganging with customer, they never got stroppy or to the customer themselves.All in all an ok hotel, good for a weekend of gambleing or shooping, just breaks into luxuary, but for the price and qulity there is far better across the marinaps, have to que and pay for breakfast",120
MBS,1,“This is place is way overrated.”,"I stayed there this weekend - and was pretty disappointed. Apart from the infinity pool at the top - the customer service is poor, all they care about is money and the lobby on a sunday looks more like a bus station than a hotel. We also had friends in Singapore that we invited to go to the pool - but it costs $100 per guest to invite! Never heard of this anywhere else I have been. Also in the mini-bar in the room - you pay for the drink just for picking it up and looking at it (some automatic sensor or something).Very disappointed and would not recommend it - there are better hotels with much better customer service.",248
MBS,3,“Not worth the money spent!~”,"Simple why u guys will ask... spending over USD400 with a check in time 3pm and out at 11am?!!! Landed you have to wait like those PRCs flooding at the seats forcing some of us to sit on the floor(Chairs not enough) The Pool is really the superb part with the soaking but many of those annoying morons just jumped in with seems like his/her pajamas into the pool with no one stopping them!!The room where they keeps their spoons(the drawer part facing us is sticky !!!!!!!!!!!) The bathroom section some even have white cement ANCE which was left out to removes.. Simple word to put the overall exp.............

I am a LOCAL trying out THIS SO CALLED 5 stars HOTEL and valuate before some of my Friends from Thailand/Canada who will likely arriving this coming July for business !! Do educate some of YOUR PUB GRO officers~~ Don't judge a person by its look !",138
MBS,3,“Nothing without the view”,"I spent 5 days here for business and have mixed reviews to report.Pros: Stunning view from the rooftop pool. If your looking to lounge for hours this is the place to be. Located near the train and shopping mall, if that's your thing.Cons: Rude Staff. They seem to forget that they are here to serve the customer, not the other way around. I've not been treated so poorly since grade school. The manager on duty was absolutely obnoxious as were others.The rooms are very pedestrian. They are no better than 3-star.Overall, I would not stay here again. I would probably look for something near Clarke Quay or Chinatown, as there is more action in those areas.If you want to enjoy the view you may do so by entering the public area. Otherwise, save your money and look elsewhere.",289
MBS,3,“Lack of customer service”,"If you are looking for that warm Singaporean welcome, then do not expect it from this hotel. I'm afraid it’s a hotel like Vegas. You are going to either love it or hate it.I was disappointed from the moment I checked in. I waited almost 20 mins in a big queue before I was able to check in. The process was inefficient and did not make me feel welcome. The place is big and I felt I was just left to find my own way to my room. I asked to be near the gym facilities but was told that would be an extra charge even though our company had a block booking, there was no flexibility or consideration of customer experience.My hotel room was OK. I have had better at other hotels in Singapore. Considering the size of this hotel, it was not as plush and new looking as I had expected.The pool area was great although a bit like a seaside resort. If you want to do laps, it will be impossible due to the number of people wanting to take “selfies” with the skyline behind. The best customer service I received was at the gym. The staff there were very welcoming.Restaurants are very expensive here, but it is worth eating at Sky57. The experience is amazing. Ku De Ta bar is great fun on an evening with cocktails overlooking the amazing skyline.Overall, I would not stay here again for the lack of customer service. The hotel rides on its name and misses out on that Singaporean hospitality. It is great for a visit or to eat at, but I felt I got a much more positive customer experience and value for money at other local hotels.",359
MBS,3,“Nice but too crowded to enjoy”,"We stayed at the Orchid Suite in August. There is a priority check in and out area for the \suite\"" bookings. The lines were still long as the normal check in desks. The queues in this area was a manic mess. It would have been great to see staff making sure people check in in an orderly manner and sticking by the lines. Who would have guessed you need your whole family and group to check in under one name? Go figure.As they were extremely busy, noone helped us with our bags or to our rooms. When we arrived at our suite it was beautiful and well decorated. Cannot fault the huge bathroom and tub it was a delight and so were the toiletries.The pool? Every man and his dog were there. We couldn't even find a place to put our towels down let alone have less than 30 cm between the next person in the pool all taking selfies in the infinity pool.The suite and club features free canapes and drinks during happy hour - don't bother the line was so long by the time we got in we had to shovel food into our mouths before the happy hour time closed.The only solace to the hustle and bustle of the hotel was the Shoppes. Brilliantly layed out designer paradise. Wonderfully over priced shops, food court and straight out to the bay. Checking out we waited 30 mins in the 'priority' queue. Amongst thousands of families, tours and people who just came to check out the hotel. It would have been a nicer stay if the hotel wasn't open to tour buses who came to just check the hotel out (major tourist attraction) and the mass amount of people who were not guided to order or lines by the staff. I found it quite short staffed to deal with the mass amount of people coming through. The waiting time to enjoy the hotel facilities was ridiculous, even when we paid a premium to enjoy these features. Won't be coming back until the hype of the hotel dies down in a few years time. Overpriced for what we got.""",406
MBS,3,“Disappointments at every turn”,"If you expect to get what you pay for, don't stay here. The disappointments started as we checked in. Similar to an airport check in, the queue is long, tiring & impersonal. The check in staff were friendly, giving us a room upgrade which did end up making me wonder what the standard of the \Deluxe\"" room would be like as the \""Premier\"" room wasn't overly spectacular. It's not that it wasn't clean or neatly appointed but it just didn't have that wow factor you'd expect from a world renowned 5 star hotel. The saving grace for the hotel is the sky park & the infinity pool that Marina Bay Sands is so well known for. The views from the 57th floor are incredible with endless photo opportunities by the pool & the adults only section is a clever touch however don't be fooled that the disappointment ends here. There are nowhere near enough sun lounges & the pool is still not large enough considering the hotel's size (approx 2600 rooms). Early or late is our best recommendation if you don't want to feel like a tinned sardine.Ku Da Ta is very cool & dinner &/or drinks here would make for a memorable night but be sure to bring your black Amex as it's very expensive!The casino is also far from impressive. To our horror smoking is permitted inside & throughout the casino! The air is thick, the floor is a disgrace & our eyes stung as we exited. If you like to gamble (as we do) & have fun at the same time, this casino has no atmosphere & it takes 20 minutes to get a round of drinks. Yet another disappointment Marina Bay Sands.One thing I can say is that all hotel staff were genuinely friendly & the service was of a 5 star standard. We did find this throughout Singapore so you don't have to stay at Marina Bay Sands to find this but I'll still give full points for service.Would we recommend the hotel? For us staying at Marina Bay Sands was a once off to experience the pool. The hotel is not intimate, romantic or personalized in anyway & I'm not sure that the pool is worth the price tag to stay again... One or two nights would be sufficient if you plan on lazing by the pool. Next time we'll stay at The W, The Westin or PARKROYAL on Pickering.""",205
MBS,3,“once in a lifetime is enough”,"We, three friends, booked the orchid suite for three nights. A lot of money spent! The hotel is spectacular no question. But if you are always in the middle of huge groups and have to queue all the time, guest service, restaurant, entry to pool etc. you don`t feel special. The pool is great and a must-see and do. If you spent time there at the early afternoon it is even quiet. But in the evening you feel like Las Vegas....Good thing is if you book a suite you have Club access. Here you get breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour snacks. You can eat and drink as much you want for limited time. But all other places are overpriced if you compare service and price with other 5 star hotel. Especially the public toilets are dirty or even defect, no matter if you are in the lobby or pool area. A no-go!All our luggage was not delivered thus we asked for help. The staff was very friendly and tried to help but sometimes we got different information so we were totally confused. Overall, yes go there, spend a night or two but don`t expect too much besides the spectacular pool and view from there.",504
MBS,1,“Marina Bay Sands More Like Marina Bay Shambles”,"Myself and 6 colleagues are staying here as part of a project rollout for my company for all our offices and have stayed in many hotels in the APAC region. Our Project Manager chose this hotel as a bit of a sweetner for giving us really early and late flights and we were all excited about it, however, we have been very disappointed. The rooms are adequate the beds are comfortable, but the rooms cannot be described as ‘luxury’ as they seem to describe them, some of the furniture is a bit scruffy. My room has no bath, which isn’t terrible, but other rooms do. However, the shower is totally abysmal, the water pressure is so poor it’s not an enjoyable experience. As there is no door on the shower, and the water pressure so low, you get very cold. I have long hair so it means I am in the shower for a long time trying to get the shampoo out, and the lack of the door on the shower means the whole bathroom floor then gets soaked, not an enjoyable experience when you want to visit the bathroom later on. The room keys are the normal card in the door job, and you also have to use this to get to your floor from reception, which isn’t an issue, if the door cards worked effectively. I have often missed my floor in the lift because the door card simply will not work. Once I get to the floor it takes 9 or 10 attempts to put the card in the door to get it to open. Very frustrating. If it wasn’t for the fact that the queue to speak to concierge is always so long I would have raised this as an issue, but I estimate it taking a good 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue, I am dreading the queue for checking out. Breakfast is my biggest issue with this hotel. It is totally and utterly appalling. You have to form an orderly queue outside the breakfast area, which is often 30 people deep and you get allocated a table once a table for the number in your party becomes available. It is a normal buffet style breakfast, however it is so over-crowded, we have rarely gotten what we wanted due to the lack of time we have, admittedly we have gone to breakfast at 08:00 which I expect is the peak time. The one day we did have some time and had breakfast later, the fried egg which I waited in line to have cooked especially was not cooked; this is disgusting. The pool is amazing yes, but it’s over crowded and noisy, but it is worth the experience. If you’re staying just one night to use the pool, then I think it would be fine, but 8 days on business for us has just been an awful experience. I think if you’re looking for a luxury or you’re here on business do not stay here.",1561
MBS,1,“Absolutely Disgusting Customer Service”,"We arrived just at check in time for the last night of our honeymoon, and lined up at the club room guest line. There were the same number of people lined up at the ordinary check in line which were promptly processed by the 7 staff members there, however as there were only 2 staff on our line, we waited about 10 minutes to be assisted even when the other staff became free, nobody offered to assist us to check in.On arriving at our room, there was a disgusting musty smell, like wet floors combined with cleaning product. I immediately went back to reception to request a change of room. I was told that the hotel was fully booked and that I could not change rooms.After again requesting the change, noting that it was uncomfortable to even be in the room for 5 minutes, let alone sleep in it, I was told that a room one level down was available. I agreed and eventually received the room key, only to point out to the staff member that the room was 10 floors down which was not acceptable.This discussion went back and forward for about 20 minutes, as the female staff member again went on to say the hotel was fully booked and that she could not assist us at all and that we could not change rooms. I asked for someone else to speak with, she did not assist. She began to smile about the situation, and I highlighted that it was not funny at all, especially for the amount we were paying for the room.Eventually, after some lengthy discussion, she concluded that she could not change our room. As I again expressed my disgust at this conclusion, and her happiness in expressing it, another male staff member came over to intervene, and went through the exact same process as above, but ultimately found another room, only 4 doors down on the same floor. In speaking with this male, he asked if there was anything else he could do for us and I mentioned perhaps a bottle of champagne in the circumstances and given the inconvenience, which he said he would gladly organise.I also requested the buy one get one free buffet voucher which was included in our package. The response was that ‘this offer does not apply on weekends’ – and seeing as we were only staying on the weekend, we booked on the basis that this was also included. After a great amount of arguing, and me outlining the misleading and deceptive nature of the offer, the hotel eventually conceded it was misleading and deceptive to include the offer of a voucher that didn’t apply to the booking, and they provided the voucher.We were given a summary of the club room benefits at checkin, and we went up to grab afternoon tea which was listed on that piece of paper as 4.30pm. On arrival at 4.00pm we were told quite rudely that afternoon tea was ‘finished’ and that we could sit down but would not be served any food, as it is all gone. I told the staff that we had the letter in the room which stated 4.30pm, where we were told we were mistaken and that we would need to produce it to be offered anything.I asked if there was any snacks etc they could offer, but she said not without the letter. So, my wife then had to go down to our room and find the letter, bring it up, and prove we were correct. After producing this document, with a half hearted apology, a few plates of food were at our table within 30 seconds (despite it apparently having all been consumed already – thus continuing the misleading comments by staff).After returning to our room that night, we noted there was no champagne. I phoned reception and they said they would ‘look into it’. An hour later, nothing. I phoned again, and was told there was no record of my previous conversations about it. I outlined my frustration at this point, and this was the first time I was informed of ‘senior management’ who had to authorise these types of requests.That night I went down and spoke with the duty manager and outlined my concerns about all of the above. She was quite receptive and wrote down my concerns. In moving forward she offered us one way transport to the airport. I indicated some partial refund would be appreciated, which she said would be possible after she spoke with ‘senior management’. She also said staff would contact me to arrange pickup time.The next day, I had received no communication at midday, so contacted the concierge who had no record or any idea about the transport. I left details and they endeavoured to contact the duty manager I spoke to. An hour later, after not receiving a response again I went back to the concierge and a car was booked with the details I gave only.An hour later, I received a call from the concierge at the other tower (tower 1) saying they had now booked another car, total confusion amongst all staff.Next we went for lunch after having made a reservation, only to be told on arrival that our voucher was not valid. I had to produce the name and details of the person I spoke to sort this out, despite being assured that it would be recorded on their system to avoid this exact situation. This was another example of the poor customer service I experienced throughout our entire stay.Again, for breakfast the next day we noted on the sheet given to us that our room included breakfast at ‘sky on 57’. Upon arrival at only 9.30am, we were told there was an unknown wait for a table. We indicated that we had to check on shortly, and eventually a table was found. On leaving the restaurant we were then told our bill was $100 or so dollars, we noted the inclusions of our room, and to avoid any further debate just charged the amount and ended up arguing with staff on checkout, who after viewing the sheet we were given, agreed it was misleading and credited the amount on our bill.Needless to say at checkout, I requested the details of the refund as compensation for the extremely unprofessional and uncourteous treatment during our stay. To which I was greeted with a ‘there is no record of anything of that sort’. I then had to go through the details of the entire stay, and this conversation, faced with numerous attempts to try and justify the poor service, took 20 minutes. The result, that the one way trip to the airport (a taxi would have cost $15 – was the ‘compensation’ for the terrible experience.I categorically highlighted the number and nature of incidents throughout our short one night stay, and again requested a refund as I was in no way satisfied with spending more than 20% of my stay making efforts to get what I had paid a great amount for – a clean room at the level I had been offered, afternoon tea which was a part of our rate, and what was promised by staff earlier in my stay and the offer extended to me in relation to lunch, a bottle of wine and ultimately a refund to compensate for the terrible experience.The response was the most disgusting example of customer service I have ever experienced. After again waiting for the staff member to research my ‘account’ for about 10 minutes, again, there was no record of the majority of what I had raised throughout my stay. Eventually, after having to explain each and every point again to the staff, and again requesting the refund that was indicated to me, the staff member said at that point it was no longer up to her, and that senior management had to approve anything that could be done. After outlining that this was not acceptable, she eventually phoned ‘senior management’, and within 1 minute came back and said ‘we have done enough by providing a trip to the airport.’ I noted that this was never requested, but was accepted, in what was explained to me, was in conjunction with a refund of some sort.The most frustrating this is simply that if this refund was never going to be offered, they could have just said that, rather than misleading a customer then trying to cover it up by wasting more of my time. In contrast, our stay at the hotel ibis a few days earlier during a stopover, we had a minor issue with the towels in the room - and it was fixed within 15 minutes (per their guarantee) and a small bottle of wine was also delivered to our room to apologise for the inconvenience with some macaroons. If this hotel, which charged 10 times less, is in a position to rectify such a small issue, so quickly and professionally, it is completely unacceptable for the Marina Bay not to do the same. What makes it worse is the arrogance and lack of simple courtesy by the staff in dealing with their customers.I was disgusted by the service I received, and was the worst experience I have had in any of my travels, even causing me to add my first review on trip advisor.",140
MBS,3,“Queues for everything”,"While the accommodation and pool are indisputably lovely the long queues for everything from checking in, to breakfast, to obtaining a taxi marred the experience, as did the temporary absence of internet on the day I arrived. For a hotel with over 2000 rooms the small number of check in staff was more in line with that of a much smaller hotel. The fact that room swipe cards became deactivated was annoying as it necessitated further queuing.After a 10 minute wait I was unimpressed at being seated on a stool at the bar for breakfast. However, apart from the rude man meant to be assisting with the taxi queue all other staff were helpful and professional and the proximity to the Convention centre very handy (if you could squeeze into an elevator). The gym was well equipped with wonderful views.",435
MBS,3,"“Big hotel, but not big hearted!”","This place is simply huge. With three separate towers having rooms, one can imagine the size of this place. What is most striking is the way it captures the Singapore skyline around the Marina with its unique Skydeck.However, if you are looking for an elegant hotel with under stated luxury with whispered service, then this is not the place for you. This place is a brash, loud, over the top hotel that wont be out of place on the Las Vegas strip. Well that is exactly the way it has been conceptualized and built.We had made a last minute decision to fly to Singapore over the new years and were lucky to get a room at this hotel for the nights of 29th & 30th Dec. We had to check out on the morning of the 31st Dec as the hotel was fully sold out. We made many requests with the front desk - at the time of check--in as well as when we were staying in the hotel requesting for any possibility for an extension in case of any cancellations. We always got the message that we will check, but sadly no one got back on our request. We had a club room that was located at the corner of Tower 2 and had views over the marina as well as the Gardens By The Bay. The room was quite big and very luxurious. The Club Lounge on the Skydeck is also a good place for breakfast and evening cocktails.Another grouse we have with the hotel is regarding the night party at the Ku De Ta for the 31st December. At the time of check-in we requested for passes for the Ku De Ta for the 31st night party. We were told that we can purchase them directly at Ku De Ta on 31st. Hence we checked with Ku De Ta on the morning of 31st Dec. There we were told that passes were available and that they will start selling the passes at 5:30pm in the lobby. We reached the lobby at exactly 5:30pm for buying the passes and we were told that the passes were available BEFORE 5:30pm! This was the most ridiculous way of dealing with guests and the hotel staff had arrogance dripping out of their noses while dealing with us making us feel like some third rate people! Our plans for the New Year's eve were thus shot.This experience really put us off the hotel big time.I gave a feedback to the hotel also about this particular instance, however, there has been no acknowledgement till date on this issue!",198
MBS,3,“Not as good as expected”,"We had a suite on 27th floor, which was OK but certainly not exceptional. Rooms were average quality and finish, with poor lighting and difficult to identify cluster light switches. View over Gardens by the Bay was good. Sky on 57 Restaurant was terrible, and nothing like advertised on the in-room TV. What bugged us most was having to show your room card everywhere you went, including 4 times just to go to the \Ku De Ta\"" restaurant on L57 (once to go past the roof-top pool, then again to get access to the restaurant, again to get out of the restaurant, and again to go past the pool again to get to the elevator). This was all ridiculous, and whilst I understand that they are making a fortune out of charging visitors for access to L57, it is highly unsatisfactory for those already paying a lot of money to stay there. The roof-top pool (more of a soup pond than a pool, very shallow and people just standing there) is a fantastic structural achievement, but my opinion is the outside visitor crowding and the associated overdone checking of room card for access ruins the whole hotel experience.""",80
MBS,3,“Difficult to check in”,"We arrived at marina bay sands at 1:45pm. Our flight times had changed so we arrived early. We struggled to find the correct check in area in the hotel lobby and it was really crowded. We have a 9 month old baby so had requested an early check in at 2:00pm in advance, this was declined, so we had to wait with a baby after a long flight (and we had booked a Grand Club Room). We were not impressed.",209
MBS,1,“The worst hotel in Singapore !”,"I heard a lot about this hotel. Lots of good reviews and friends recommendations.I went there with very hight expectations ! But unfortunately it was a very bad experience !Room was smelly, like a restaurant kitchen smell when we checked-in !! Toilet smells like a public bathroom, You know when they mope the floor again and again with the same mope and it smells ?? Yes that was the room's toilet smell.Room service food won't even reach a 3-star hotel.LOOOOONG que to check-in and check-out !! it feels like an airport flights check-in !!concierge are always busy !!breakfast restaurant is always FULL and some of the food is finish! the roof-top swimming pool is very very crowded, not comfortable at all !! it feels like a public pool. but the view is amazing.one more annoying thing, is that when you call the express service from your room, they have that long introduction to say each time which takes around 15-20 seconds and after it they mention your name. off course you're name won't be right because most of the operators don't speak english well. and are very hard to communicate with them. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone specially if you are used to luxury 5-star hotels !!",199
MBS,2,“Bigger is not better”,"Unfortunately we stayed here at 100% occupancy. We chose this hotel because of its location to the convention centre.Apart from the building being enormous it doesn't cut a 5 star rating in my opinion. We stayed in a suite with club access. The room was just bland with dated furniture. It would have to be the most disappointing suite at a 5 star hotel I've stayed in. I had to ask for our room aned by 4 one afternoon. I had a staff member knock on the door to see if the room was occupied. The movies were not current. They don't even supply long life milk, just powdered.The lobby isn't really a lobby it's more like an airport check in and it is full of tourists taking photos of themselves standing in front of almost anything.Whilst the infinity pool is impressive, it's full of people taking selfies.If you want to stay in a massive building, gamble, buy luxury goods and swim in an infinity pool in the sky - this is the hotel for you. Just take into consideration that you will be doing so with hundreds of other people who will be taking photos of themselves everywhere.",62
MBS,2,“Disapointed”,Not a nice room you can expected for 400 euros !!! Monster hotel with many many rooms Swimming pool is overcrowded like a waterpark in summer Staff not overfriendly We booked room for 3 - in fact they just add a bed in a standard roomWith a kit in plastic bag for showergel- towels...And you can not move in room after ...,147
MBS,3,“On the right track but not quite there yet”,"We recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands because we thought we would give it a go. Perhaps our experience was hampered because there was a conference on at the same time, but overall we found the service etc to be less than what we would have expected.The rooms were OK. Nothing too special. But the staff are trained to distinguish heavily between guest types. Unfortunately, they use attire to do this. We were staying in their higher executive floors. Whenever we were dressed in suits, everyone was extremely attentive. However, whenever we were dressed casually, we were disregarded.I think that this hotel needs to have a standard and apply that standard to all guests. Otherwise they risk disenfranchising others. We'll give it a bit more time and then see if they've managed to fix this, but at this stage we won't be in a hurry to return.",709
MBS,2,“A world of Elitist”,"The Marina Bay Sands resort is an impressive complex with opulent decorations, artifacts and shopping. It was built with the goal of satisfying the top 1% who could afford to be part of the Clubs, Cliques, and Chic jet set that make up the rich and famous. If you are not part of that crowd, you are still welcome to visit, but please don’t touch the furniture. I have stayed in five star resorts and hotels in many countries in the world, the my stay at MSB was the first time that I felt that I was an inconvenience to the staff who had to take their precious time away from some elite member who arrived with his own bodyguards to let me do something meager, like check in. After standing in the commoner line for over 45 minutes, I was graced with the attention of one of the gentlemen behind the counter that allowed me to check in to my measly S$550 per night room. At five star resorts in the Philippines, Thailand and the even the USA, not only is the check in process quick and painless, but someone always escorted me to my room, explaining the facility as we went. Not at MBS where I was handed my key with a “Just follow the signs that way until you get to Tower 3. You are dismissed.” Well, the last part wasn’t said, but it was how it felt. After fifteen minutes of exploration, and one gracious hotel guest that showed me how the key worked in the elevator, I found my way to my room on the 42nd floor. The greatest attraction at Marina Bay sands is the Skypark and Infinity pool on the 57th floor, and honestly it is nothing short of spectacular. The view of the city and surrounding bay is impressive both during the day and at night. However, again I ran into the wall of the elite. There is a public restaurant and bar on the 57th floor, but there is also some areas reserved for guests of the hotel. Touring through this later part I found a place called the Cheese and Chocolate bar. Being a cheese lover, I thought a glass of wine with some cheese sounded good. However, I was stopped at the door and firmly, but politely, told that I was not a club member so I could not enter the almost empty establishment. Instead I was directed to an outside area where I could get French fries! They even let me sit in the chair. I felt privileged.As spectacular as it is, the Skypark was also the source of my final frustration with MBS. Access to the infinity pool is reserved for hotel guests, which I can understand. However, as a hotel guest, I wished to take a couple of my local friends to the pool as my guests one afternoon. A hotel key is required to access the pool area, so I went in search of a method to take guests. I was soundly informed, not by one but by four different persons that it was not allowed for me to take guests to the pool. Dejected, I headed back for my room when I spotted an older Chinese gentleman welcoming a half a dozen people her had just arrived by taxi, all carrying swimming apparel. This gentleman escorted his group to the same elevator that I was using, all the while handing out hotel keys like he was dealing cards from a deck. I immediately returned to the reception desk asking how this Chinese gentleman could take guests to the pool, but I could not. Okay, I get it, I’m not a member of the club. I can check Marina Bay Sands off of my list of places to experience, and I won’t be experiencing it again. The room itself was nice, but nothing spectacularly different the a hotel room at any of the top hotels in Singapore, just twice as expensive. I did get to pay for the privilege of staying there and offered one of the room keys as a souvenir when I checked out. I should have taken it as that was the last time I will be spending my money there.",519
MBS,1,“5 Star Exterior with -5 Star Service”,"Attended a conference and stayed there for three nights. Was asked to pay a $200 deposit, which I did in cash after been notified that a debit card charge will take 2-3 months to reverse. I was assured that my card will not be charged. Checked out and found out they did charge my credit card, emailed them. It has been 2 working days and I have yet to receive a reply from them. It's an unauthorized charge and yet they are not taking this seriously. I've called and left two messages since and just asked the operator to get someone to call me back, been waiting for 40 minutes now and still no one has called me back. Other -5 star service from MBS:1. I had a staff followed me from the elevator to the pool verification area because he was concerned that I wasn't a guest despite showing him my room key card. Let me put things to perspective here: My Caucasian colleagues were gathered at the pool bar and I was on my way to join them. None of them were escorted by the staff to the place to verify their card before entering the pool area. Except for me.2. Whilst on the phone with the Front Office Accounts person about my credit card charge (see the opening above), clearly she was not equipped to handle irate customers. Instead of asking me for a statement, she just repeatedly told me no charges has been made, raising her voice each time and answering 'Yes, I think so' when I ask does she think I am imagining the charge. 3. Clearly there was something wrong with my colleague's room phone - it keeps cutting off whenever it's answered. Notified them before going off to the conference. Still not working after 10 hours of notification. 4. Asked a staff at the concierge if there is a pay phone nearby as I was meeting someone and my international roaming was not working, was told haughtily that there are no pay phone available and promptly turned to serve another customer without offering me an alternative. I've stayed in hotels with less stars that has staff that will put MBS to shame. 5. Notified them that I needed late checkout but was told sorry, they didn't have that on file at 7am just as I was leaving for my half day conference. A good thing I did called up and check because I have a feeling they don't have all it together, the front office staff. Was it all bad? Well, here are the few things that was nice:1. The bellhop that took my luggage to storage was polite and patient to wait while I pack. Because of reason #5 above 2. Jim Rinehart from concierge was friendly and was able to have a conversation with me without sounding like a robot reading the customer service manual.So, maybe you will not have an experience that like mine. But be warned that you would have to be extra vigilant with front office. And pack nicer clothes - clearly peasants are not welcomed there.",157
MBS,3,"“Not worth the price, pretty standard, nothing spectacular”","I stayed here as I was attending a conference, and thankfully most of the accommodation was paid and I received a discount for the nights that I did pay for. The hotel is pretty impersonal because of its size. There was nothing really special about staying here. There was no bath in our room which I would expect staying in a glamorous hotel.The pool is very amazing and a great experience to be up so high with such an awesome view, but it is so busy that it is difficult to find a spot to put your stuff, let alone get a lounge chair.The in-room dining wasn't too bad - expensive, but then most things in Singapore are expensive.We had room 1707 in Tower 3 which had a nice view to the city, although the air-con never went below 21 even though I had it set on 18 for the night.I probably would not stay here again.",247
MBS,3,“Probably not worth your $$”,"The place is beautifully done, but it is very pricey. The hotel is known for it's infinity pool at the very top of the hotel. The water is not heated so even though they open at 6 am, not attractive to get in the water. For the price one is paying, you would think they would heat the pool up a bit. Very pretentious place and must have connection to get hookups at the pool bar. We saw a manager hitting up with some girls and giving them free drinks and food throughout the morning and he even admitted it out loud their food and drinks was on the house, and he would love to have met with the girls later that evening. Reservation process is a bit archaic given they are a high end hotel. When you make reservations online, after getting a confirmation number emailed to you, make sure you get a reservation ID shortly thereafter, otherwise, your reservation did not go through. Of course they will not tell you this. If you need to make changes, you have to call the hotel directly (Singapore) since there's no where online to modify reservations. When making reservations at their restaurant, Skypark for dinner, make sure to ask for the minimum per person. They will not tell you that there's a minimum and it was S$180/person. If you have friends, you can't take them to the pool since each person need to have a valid room card.",185
MBS,2,“Absolutely not recommend”,"Unless you're a gambler, otherwise don't stay there. For room, they charge high price (unless u gamble there and get free room) , inside the room no coffee or tea provide, electronic refrigerator (mean move a can of coke, will charge on your bill automatic), shower hot water unstable (actually no hot water even fix). Air condition very noise...For eat, downstair buffet queue at least 30 people and expensive, no starbucks or chain coffee nearby. (one cafe in shopping mal open at 10am) G/F has similar coffee shop but over charge, other restaurants need to walk at least 15 mins. Room services at unreasonable price. For traffic, a.m. taxi queue ok, in evening, don't even think about it. MRT 5 mins hotel to station, but to all other station, so inconvenice to find the exit. Conceige not helpful, just want u to leave asap. Only the swimming pool is outstanding, then u only stay there for one night, not the whole trip in Sing, stay at Swissotel Stamford, better service, convenience to everywhere, and easy to find restaurant at reasonable price, don't need to queue.",199
MBS,3,“Nice view but...”,"We stayed at Marina Bay sands hotel for one night on the way for our honeymoon. We stayed at the delux room with city view at 37th floor. The view was indeed amazing and the room was very large, however, there were some disappointments. Firstly, I thought the breakfast at the Sky restaurant at the top floor was quite terrible for the price. Lack of variety and just bad main dishes. Afterwards, we went to the swimming pool but it was not very cleanly managed or organized. Still nice view though. Additionally, I thought there should be more desk clerks as the check in/out was very slow. The express machine also tried to charge the breakfast which is already included in the package... The gym was nice and had a great view to the city. Spa was not bad but felt very small and the sauna was also too weak. Definitely nice hotel and shopping mall was quite impressive. Well convenient that all the complex is placed within. I will score Average as if the staffs are better trained and managers paying more attention to small details, then Marina bay sands will truly be the best hotel in Singapore.",194
MBS,2,“recent stay”,"fabulous hotel, amazing architecture BUT service was WOEFUL! I originally booked for 4 nights in a suite until my son visited and warned me that the service was poor and their breakfast was not up to standard, so cancelled the booking and booked ONE night at the end of our stay in a basic room and that it was..a basic room, the air conditioning sounded like a road train, after complaining they did promptly send someone to service/fix it. The check in was a joke, we arrived early and were given entry to the pool, we came back again later in the day and were given the run around , after standing in a queue to recheck in we were told that the business centre could check us in, moved out of the check-in line and then had to wait again for half an hour in the business office. The pool was amazing, but crowded and the surrounds of the pool was dirty with litter . Poolside service was slow. all in all..glad I did not stay 4 nights and I wouldn't return. The shopping mall was fabulous with plenty of choice for eating",142
MBS,2,“The Grand Delusion….”,"BIG, Crowded, bad service, and not very clean…Well I was so disappointed, I thought I should once go and see this \phenomenal \"" place, but it was one of very bad experiences, , even the acclaimed KuDeTa restaurant was extremely expensive and the food was limit , ordinary and not that good. To end in disgrace, the people at the front desk are not very nice, as when you ask them to charge a different card then the \""masterCard\""…they start inventing stupid excuses only because they promote MasterCard rather than VISA, Shameful. Worst, at the end the receptionist charged my bill twice, now I will have to spend long painful hours on phones to dispute and get it back, god knows when… and it was terribly expensive.Obvioussly the Pool is magnificent, but no need to stay at the hotel for that !""",340
MBS,2,"“One word to describe the hotel service \SUCKS\""”""","I have been staying at MBS for short getaway trip many times, but this time i found their service is really terrible, getting from bad to worst! First of all, it took so long for the check in process, and the front desk officer didn't even smile and greet their customer. I understand they are very busy due to MBS is a very famous tourist attraction, but i think it doesn't mean that you can act unprofessionally when you are having a good business, don't tell me when your business starts dropping only provide a good customer service, i think that's too late.When i got in to my room, i fond there is a birthday cake and maccaron on the table and obviously it doesn't belong to me, i have to call to the service counter many times then only they act on it!! i stayed there for 3 days 2 nights, guess what!! There is no one cleans the room even though the \make up room\"" button was on the whole day. I have to call to the service counter again at night and get someone to clean it! In addition, their pillow is too soft and it is very uncomfortable!On the 2nd day, i went back to my room after lunch, and found that my room keys didn't work, unable to open my room door. And the best thing is the hotel guests who stayed next door experienced the same problem! i got to sit there and wait for their security or whoever to open the door for me after 20 mins and he didn't even bother to apologize to the guest, he gave me that kind of feeling that\"" take it or leave it\"" but come on… your are the so call 5 stars or 4.5 stars hotel, how can you provide such a lousy customer service.Even though the location and room is not bad, but with this kind of customer service, it really makes me to think twice whether to stay there again in the future.""",369
MBS,2,“Mammoth sized Hotel with very average service”,"This hotel is extremely large with approximately 2500 guest rooms.Upon Arrival to the hotel, it was just mayhem they were too busy. We arrived by taxi and no one opened the doors from our taxi. We had to get our own bags out of the taxi and bring them to the concierge desk as all the staff were too busy. I find this not acceptable for a five star hotel, we paid approximately $900 SGD per night.The check-in queue was so long I could not believe it. Fortunately, we had booked a club room which has a dedicated check-in desk so the wait only took about 15 minutes rather than 90 minutes!!!Check-in was quick and not personable as the lines were too long. We went to Tower 1 for the club room and took the lifts to level 46. Tower 1 is a long walk from the registration desk. When we got to the room, our room key did not walk. I cannot tell you how frustating it was. There was a housekeeping maid who tried to help us but could not. So she told us to go back to reception. We went all the way back down and had to wait another 30 minutes, UNACCEPTABLE!! they should of sent a duty manager or staff member up to open the door for us and bring us a new set of keys.After all that mess, we finally got into our room which already ruined the first day of our stay.The club room itself was nice with good views of the water and gardens by the bay. Large size for singapore standards and a good bathroom (however it smelt like SMOKE!!!) even though it was a non smoking room/floor.As most reviewers have mentioned the best thing about this hotel is the infinity pool and gymnasium. Club benefits included free wi-fi, breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes and drinks for dinner so it is good value if you use it.Overall, I would not return to the Marina bay sands. I have crossed it off the bucket list. The hotel is too big and does not have enough staffing levels for the hotel capacity. There is no customer service and it is very impersonable.",1116
MBS,3,“Not a 5* Hotel or a 5* service......”,"On only day 2 of our 3-night stay at Marina Bay Sands I feel compelled to write my review. I have a backlog of great reviews of other hotels to write about but I couldn't wait for this one.It's not a 5* hotel nor is it a 5* experience it's more akin to a tourist attraction and not a very good one at that.As part of our celebration of our recent Engagement my fiancé and I booked in for 3 nights. They only had a Double Deluxe available when booking and had it not been for my fiancé really wanting to experience the highest infinity pool in the world we would probably have gone elsewhere with a better room selection but it was only 3 nights so booked the room.You can't help but admire the building on the drive up from the airport as it is an architectural marvel. On entering the lobby you can't help but notice the number of people there were milling about. It took 20+ minutes to check in and the use of four PDQ machines swapping cables over. There was some kind of issue using my Debit card rather than Credit card. I only use the latter for emergencies, as I like to pay as I go. The receptionist explained that she would have to pre authorise my card for 400SGD, which I had no problem with as it could be refunded when we checked out. It was the quick comment of it may take 30 days to receive the refund that got my attention. In this day and age it does not take 30 days to refund money on a Debit card. It wasn't the money it's the principle that they have a policy to keep your money for up to 30days. 2500 customers doing that 365 days a year makes a nice little in interest. We arrived at 13.00 and knew before we arrived that check in was 15-00, which we didn't have an issue with as we could have lunch while we waited. The receptionist explained that as it we were early she could only offer us a room on a lower floor or we could wait for a high room. We said we will wait. After several frantic taps of her keyboard she informs us that even after 15-00 she can still only offer a lower floor. Why bother saying anything if all they had was lower floors available. While checking in my fiancé felt dizzy so went to sit down in the crowed seating area. Later she informed me that a security guard had rudely told her not to sit where she was sitting, as it was Art not a seat. Having looked later it was in fact a combination of both but nonetheless they need to teach their staff some manners or get more practical seats given the number of people.Debit card sorted and room allocated we walked through the central lobby towards Tower 3 where our room was located. Well I say we walked we dodged our way through the hoards of people. There must have been a big conference in the hotel as lots of people with name badges hung round their necks and not to mention the guided tours of 50+ in groups with the guide walking ahead with a number so they didn't all get lost. It was more like a shopping mall than hotel lobby.The room was on floor 3 and yes that is very low. In fact only 2 floors above the Motorway directly outside our window. Yes a motorway with 2 x 4 lanes with in excess of 200 cars a minute driving by. And everyone can be heard from the room. The room was of a size we expected for a deluxe room and the bathroom was a reasonable size but the décor was more akin to a Travel Lodge than that of a 5* hotel.Having been out all afternoon and done a lot of walking we decided to go for dinner at Jin Shan Lou the Chinese restaurant in the hotel Lobby. Thankfully we only ordered 2 items as the portions are very large although the beef with noodles we ordered was not the same as the photo and was more like beef with lasagna pasta. I asked for some fresh lime with my sparkling water rather than lemon and was told they don’t have limes. What 5* hotel doesn’t have limes? When I signed for the bill the waitress said let “wait let go me go check” I presumed she meant just check my name matched that of my room. The waitress came back and said no our machine is not working and put the bill on the table. I gave her my card and she passed me the PDQ machine the words “PIN” came out of her mouth. This hotel needs to teach their staff some manners. I’m not a rude tourist and do not expect to be treated like one. Why on earth does the hotel pre authorise your Debit card for incidentals and then not be able to use it.Later that night we tried to get some sleep but with a combination of the endless traffic and the hoards of people walking about in the open plan lobby only 3 floors below was very difficult.Today we ventured to the now famous infinity pool on the 57th floor and were met with scenes more like a holiday camp than a 5* hotel. It was only 10-30am and yet there were towels thrown everywhere, plastic glasses floating in the pool. The cramped nature of the sun decks doesn’t give you a 5* experience. Yes I know there are 2500 rooms and a lot of people want to visit the pool, but they should have thought about that during the design stage. We had a milk shake that they clearly forgot to shake as it was merely sickly vanilla flavored milk and to top it off one drink had an insect in it.When you look past the splendid architecture you are left with a less than 5* finish in the hotel. Poor quality grout has already turned green, as has the timber decking around the pool, dirty paintwork on the roof. Poor quality wallpaper and Perspex surround to the lift lobbies is falling apart, cheap stainless steel surrounds to the glass on the viewing gallery. Broken doors out to the external bridge creating a free for all to get in and out. I could go on forever about the poor quality of finishes but one thing for sure they will have a huge ongoing maintenance problem. I’m afraid we wont be visiting the hotel again.",32
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands”,Lovely location and the infinity pool is MAGNIFICENT. Never liked the shopping much but that is because I like buying ethnic and individualistic creative things rather than mall-shopping which is so generic.,264
MBS,3,“5* Price 3* Service”,"My friend and I stayed here for the one night on our way home after travelling through Vietnam. MBS is a destination hotel, the infinity pool on the 57th floor is the reason people come here and it's a great pool. The not so great is the inordinate amount of time it took for us to be checked in and then after all of that to not even be given the room booked. We asked for a twin room and instead given a room with a king bed and a made up sofa bed. Not good enough for the SGD650 they are charging for a night. For this rate I would also expect breakfast to be included, but no, it isn't.Back to the pool, when we arrived in the afternoon the pool was absolute mayhem, not a spare sun lounger to be found so we ended up waiting around til 2 were free & then we went for a swim, only to come back and find that someone had removed our towels, dumped our belongings and taken our lounges, amazingly rude! I went back to the pool at 7am the next morning to take advantage of the peace and it was great. As one other reviewer has mentioned don't forget to take a card each, you won't be allowed in the pool area otherwise. Also beware when you are getting the lift from the ground floor random people asking you if they can have your pass to the pool...overall i'm glad i've been but I won't be in any hurry to stay here again.",312
MBS,2,“stolen ipad/property spoils the trip”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands with my daughter and her nanny for 6 nights in February after great reviews from my husband. First night in two deluxe rooms and five nights in the orchid suite and a premier room with a connecting door. Even though checking in took a while longer than is expected for a hotel of this calibre, everything went okay until I mistakenly left my ipad mini in my room on the 20th (a day before checking out on the 21st Feb) and didn't find it when I got back to the room. what really irked me was the nonchalant attitude to my complaint. I got an email stating that '' We regret to inform you that the lost item has not been found nor has it been turned in to the Lost & Found Office''. Really like being brushed off like an annoying worker and not a paying customer/client. No call to me to make adequate enquiries or details from me about, nothing. I have stayed in many five star hotels around the world and never had anything stolen from my room. Eventually realised that my daughters skirt and top up card for my phone line that we couldn't locate were probably stolen as well, but I didn't think anything was going to be done about it so didn't bother reporting it. I had so much data and pictures on my ipad and was really sad about the loss. Some of the staff were really professional, very helpful and really nice like Sasha in the in-room dining department and the ladies in the club restaurant on the 57th floor that went all out to accommodate my daughters dietary requirements, but I wont be going back to this hotel. Security of property is high on my list for a choice of hotel accommodation. Hence the poor reviews.",280
MBS,2,"“Tried it once, never coming back”","For the price we paid for a stay in Marina Bay Sands, the level of service was way less than what we have expected.- Check-in is ghastly. I would have expected to be treated as a guest, but I felt more like i'm in a grocery check-out counter.- The door lock of the room they gave us didn't work. Whenever we insert a card, the device would flash red and the door would not unlock. Tried it on both cards, both cards would not work. We were upstairs for around 30 minutes before someone came up to assist us. For a hotel this big, we were expecting people answering the phone would at least be able to understand english. It took a while for them to understand our problem. The lady who came up to assist us tried to help. After about around 15 minutes of tinkering with the card and the door, she found a complicated (yet inconsistent) way of making it work: pushing the card in while pulling on the door handle with all your might, which would work after about half a dozen tries.- In spite of the inconvenience (tired from a flight and waiting about an hour outside the hotel room just to get inside), they did not change our room nor apologized/gave compensation for anything. Other hotels would have probably changed our room/gave an upgrade; in MBS, not even a sorry. In conclusion, in MBS, you will pay for the architecture, definitely not the service. You will be nothing but a single face in a herd. If you can afford to stay in Marina Bay Sands, stay in Raffles or The Forest by Wangz instead.",534
MBS,2,“terrible service for 5-star hotel”,"MBS used to be my only choice for staycation. But after this round, never again. The staff used to be very friendly and accommodating, allowing 4 key cards per room or one card for 2 adults when u visit the skypark. This time, I booked a one-night stay with my friends to relax after such a busy week. We had a nice view of Gardens by the Bay and the room had a balcony but not a single chair there. And to my horror, they only gave a maximum of 2 cards. We didn't know that they suddenly changed their rules max 2 cards per room so we went to the skypark. The staff at the tower 1 lift on the 57th floor, called Vinnie or something, forgot her exact name, completely denied us access even to pass through just to use the middle lift to access the gym. She said that one card is for 1 adult + 1 child. No matter how we tried she just refused. Hello my group is 4 adults and u only give 2 cards, we wanna enjoy together why should they have this inflexible rule that we either take turns to use the facilities or register and get another card?? Ridiculous!! So this commotion went on and people were watching, how embarrassing it was, over a minor situation that was uncalled for. This is totally unacceptable. The hotel rate is already so expensive why be so rigid on this? As a guests we feel unwelcomed. They said they want the skypark to be exclusive to hotel guests only, nonsense! Firstly they disregard us as guests by not allowing us to enter. Secondly, my frens are already in bathrobe it's so freaking obvious we are hotel guests and disallowed to just change the bloody lift to access the gym and sauna and enjoy the view at the pool. My frens are overseas visitors btw. The skypark is the selling feature and guests are treated this way. Terrible service! So we couldn't be bothered with Vinnie anymore and I went to the reception to try my luck to request for another key card. THIS WAS SUCH A JOKE, one staff upstairs telling me to get another card and reception still rigidly insisted max 2 cards. Extra card pay $100. Being branded a 5 stars hotel is shame with service like that. Even 3 stars hotel that I stayed at overseas had much friendlier and accommodating service.On the day of our checkout, somehow we managed to get 2 more cards. To be logical, we would visit the skypark only after we left the room because of time constraint. When we went up, card expired, what the heck. I totally don't understand this stringent rule that totally doesn't make sense. 5 stars hotel, Singapore's iconic skypark, and refuse your guests entry. If u have more guests, take turns. Crap.They should learn how to be more flexible. In the service industry it is very important to make your guests feel welcomed. Now I host my overseas frens in a place rated 5* with sudden lousy service I also feel bad and embarrassed. Thanks for the inflexibility MBS u totally ruined our fun.",176
MBS,1,"“Spectacular building, big bathroom. But not worth the price.”","Spectacular building, big bathroom. But not worth the price. No service at all. The lobby just like a bazaar, full of people. Very few receiption counters so that need to queue up all the time when check in and check out. A black guy helped us check in. But very cold, with no smile. We lived there at my husband's birthday. No greetings, not to say a birthday cake. So we bought one from outside, but we found the frige in the room can not be used. Anything you take out will be charged immediately. Then I found out there are so many notices in the room are about penalty or paid service...be careful! The view from swimming pool at 57th floor is fantastic. But the water is dirty, full of sands at the bottom, strong chloride smell. No any facilities at the children's pool, no slide, even no buoy, no fun...Moreover, no shuttle bus between hotel and airport. There are so many great hotels in Singapore, but not this one. Just worth paying a visit.",74
MBS,3,“Good for just one night”,This is a very big hotel with lots of tour groups. The rooms are large and well-designed and it is located on top of a subway stop. The impersonal service at check-in can be improved. Perhaps this is the result of the amount of check-ins they need to process every day. It was good to stay for just one night to check out the hotel but I would not choose to stay here again.,362
MBS,3,“Worth one stay”,"We chose MBS mainly for the building and the pool. We stayed 2 nights of the 4 were in Singapore.This is a difficult review because the building and pool are amazing and worth seeing, but the overall experience of the hotel itself is not equally good for what you pay. At arrival nobody helped us with the luggage, thing that surprised me because I saw 2 staff members smoking and chatting near the entrance.The check in process took almost 40 minutes for the inefficiency of the front desk employee. We had booked a Premium room with city view, preferably with 2 beds and a rollaway, for me and 2 teenagers. First she told us we had to pay $ 100 for the rollaway per day (1st hotel of this category on our trip through Asia to charge that), after she told us that the room was no longer available and gave us a king bed + sofa bed. She gave us the wrong tower written on the card, and we wandered through the hotel for 10 minutes trying to find the right room.The room was very spacious, with a great view and excellent bathroom. Carpet was not very clean as all the furniture surfaces.We ordered room service 2 times and was very good. We also had dinner at Rise lounge.Staff at restaurants and room service is very good, but the billing is confusing because they charge 10% for Service charge and leave the total amount open with a space to add the tip. Giving that the prices are already high, it’s misleading and we didn’t know whether tipping or not. Besides, the employees we asked told us that Service charge doesn’t go to them.The pool was amazing but freezing. People entered the pool only for pictures, nobody was enjoying themselves in that ice cold water. In some times of the day the pool zone was so crowded that was impossible to find a chair and less to relax.The hotel is big, crowded and impersonal. Lobby is full of visitants taking pictures and walking in groups all the time.A one time experience, really not the place we will choose again for a vacation.",319
MBS,3,“Very Nice hotel but!”,"Nice hotel, clean, awesome view and beautiful infinity pool. However, very poor communication from the booking staff and check in counter. Bellhop staff was very helpful upon taking our luggage to our room and taking down our stuff in there left luggage area with the help of Polo. But after checking out and collecting our luggage from there left luggage area tower 3 entrance around 10pm on 21st of January 2014, There were 3 Indian looking bellhop staff who gave us our luggage and bags and after that they just stare us and did not help to load our luggage in our taxi considering it was 3 of them doing nothing and busy chatting to each other. Taxi driver was surprise that no one was helping us to load our luggage..My nightmare started upon checking in. The staff assisting us told me that the only available room was only two single beds despite that I emailed and request for a double queen size bed for me and my family 2-3 months ago. The guy told me that according to the marina bay email it was subject to availability. I agreed to him but they are not informing me that there are no double queen bed is available instead I received an email of confirmation of my booking without any warning so I assume that my booking request was ok. We are so tired especially my kids on that night so I don’t bother to find another hotel. I accepted what the guy offered me a 1 queen size bed and single bed. I ended up sleeping in small couch of our room and It was a very uncomfortable night for me trying to fit in to the couch. I wake up the following morning with a sore back with a lack of sleep.Considering of my bad experience I enjoy the pool and the good service of the pool attendant.",1144
MBS,3,"“Though Luxurious in name, average stay. Definitely not suited for family vacation/ Staycation.”","Just Checked out today after a one night stay with MBS. Initially before going, always thought it was a very Nice hotel but turns out average. Had a better and more comfi stay RWS Sentosa or even Park Royal by Beach Road. Anyway, here's to share what i find and observe with MBS and i hope to see IMPROVEMENTS. It was a quick check in process at 1.45pm with the front counter at Tower 3 even though the given check in time was at 3pm.. given a room at the 30 Storey, amazing view, facing the Gardens by the Bay... Perhaps why was it so expensive for the room was just because of the spectacular VIEW... I have to say that it was really very nice. Lifts was fast moving, but because the large in flux of visitors.... Indons, PRCs, we were all squashed up at the lobby area... everyone was just in a rush to get into the LIFTS.... we waited till the 4th time before boarding a empty lift to the 30th storey... AIRCON running full blast along the walkway... classy and cooling.... ROOM was surprising nicer than RWS... slight bigger... and has a open door concept of the bathroom room... more for couple than family... But the view was absolutely Breath Taking...haha...Next, moving onto the cleanliness of room.. corners of the curtains were Very dirty, they did not seem to have clean the corners for long time... even for the 2 lamps by the side of the bed. Not good for a hotel of this standard. Disappointed in this area.Moving on, the mini fridge was chargeable immediately if the door is opened with its beverages/beers moved or taken and not consume, my children was excited but to our business hotel, no excuse about that... so i will leave you guys to judge if is ok?But anyway, even if you brought along any medicines for whatever standby reasons which needs to be kept in the fridge, you are NOT suppose to place it in the fridge else get ready to be charge... So this is really one BIG reason i wont be coming back... not worth the service.... Moving on, check in was only given 2 room cards. me and my wife. kid 4 yrs old not eligible for the card. Their card has 2 holes in the middle of it... so if you are thinking of using your membership cards or other normal cards to slot into the wall which allows you to switch on the electricity in the room. Forget about it.... ECO friendly i guess... so dont bother to leave your aircon on the whole day if you got your siblings or friends along in the rooms. Additional charges speaks... Whatever is it, anytime, their cards has to be inside the key slot else no electricity... So if you have a party here... 4 friends? one going shopping.. 2 going swimming at their Best swimming pool around?? (I will move on to that in a while) 1 more just want to be a couch potatoe.... You guys are going to quarrel i guess. Cause.. in order to gain access to pool. 2 cards must be physically there.. Else GUARDS guarding the pool are going to refuse entry. With a standard reply.. go take your cards and then come back.... pretty strict rules.. a surprise i find in the class of hotel for MBS. Let's move on.... so guys for 4 in a room.... book 2 rooms ok??On entering the swimming pool... nice in the picture.... not too bad with the real things... pretty nice... sky top swimming sort of..VERY nice VIEW, But i guess is just crowded with too many visitors many many PRCs.... Not too comfi for a relaz kind of swim or privacy class.... Park Royal at Beach Road beats MBS to these relaxation or private feel.... The sky top swim was just to cluttered... I did not enjoy it.... Perhaps it was because of a Friday? or i dont really know.... it was not relaxing at all.... MBS Staffs really should other hotels and see what i mean..... Need improvement on this arena.Moving on.... Carpark..... hahah... this is the best.... Such a nice hotel..., and their carpark is a distance away..... right at the convention centre side.... It's not under the hotel at ALL.... Call a valet else park yourself and walked another DISTANCE to the Hotel.. stay there to know... or you will think i am joking.... ok, let start with after bringing my family to the hotel.... about to go back to my car to take the luggage... asked the staff at Tower 3 manning the check in check out counter at about 2-3pm ( he is a eurasian or an indian.... distinctly recognize by his bald head..) where is the short cut to the carpark... As i parked my car near to the Cold Storage shop. Ans: Yes sir, MBS is a huge area, i am not sure about the carpark... For the location of your carpark, can you proceed to tower 1 and asked the valet, they wil be able to advise you. Tower 3 to Tower 1 valet section is another 5mins walk... So i asked him again: so you mean no basement carpark for the hotel itself... Sir, please proceed to the valet, i think they can answer your question... haha... i think maybe i was under dress that they are not taking me seriously.... i skip tower 1, and walked towards the convention centre to locate myself instead.along the way, came across a concierge manned by a malay girl.. so i asked her the same questions... luckily this time... answered more better than our MR Bald head friend. She say that there are no basement carpark for the hotel.. only at the convention centre side.. So if you are driving, either drop your bags off tower 1 or tower 3 with the bellboy and have to park at convention centre. then use their valet service... else you have to carry your bags from convention centre side all the way to the hotel.... Long Long walk.... This is really super disadvantage....then imagine carrying the bags back to the hotel and you forget the toys at the car.... ahhahaha WALKed all the way back,....Next, My fav.... the lounge between tower 1 and tower 2... if i did not remember wrongly.... Very enjoyable session there..... had some cocktails and the live band was GOOD... only.... felt a bit not so exclusive as there was many people streaming pass you..... throughout the 1 hr sitting there,,, imagine if you like to sit by orchard road.... and having many ppl to pass by you..... maybe i would leave this as try to know basis.This roughly sums up my STaycation with MBS.... hope you guys can improve... should i ever visit your hotel again!! :)",257
MBS,3,“Overrated”,"I've had many stay-cations in this hotel, recently my mother received a complimentary night stay and it was a disaster! I have never been this disappointed with any other hotel staff and their attitude to this extent before. Almost all the staff there are foreigners and they are neither understanding nor helpful. I don't know if it's because they know I'm a local or if it's because my room was free? Of course there are one or two nice staff but then they get overshadowed easily. Another thing that irritated me is their silly rule. Every guest needs a hotel card to access the infinity pool. If that is the case, they should tell us during check in and give 3 cards for 3 of us but they only gave the usual 2. We had left 1 in the room for air-con so we only had 1 card for 3 people. We were obviously denied entry and questioned for a few minutes before the the staff reluctantly let us through. The hotel is huge and very nicely built. It has over 2,000 rooms. That means if you want peace and quiet, you won't get it. Their lobby is like a train station, always noisy and crowded. However the Skypark is beautiful! The view is amazing, you could spend hours just staring at the skyline. Another good thing about the hotel is their delicious bread and butter pudding available from room service or the Rise lounge. It's my favorite and sometimes I drop by just to eat it!",162
MBS,3,“Too pricey!”,We stayed for 2 nights towards the end of our trip in Singapore thinking we would save the best till last. However it was not all that we thought it would be. Check in staff seemed to have an attitude. We had the city view room and it had excellent views of the city and river. The room was nice but the carpet looked like it wasn't vacuumed properly. We had paid extra for the club package however it is not really worth it as the food available in the club room was disappointing. Only a small variety of muffins and fruit. The people working in the club room were not that friendly.The pool was very good on the roof. Great views but windy.Nice location near the shopping mall of designer brands if that is what you are into.Overall not really anything special for the price you pay per night. Excellent views and pool but try other 5 star hotels if possible.,387
MBS,3,"“Incredible pool, great location, pity the shortcomings”","Had a chance to have a staycation at this hotel \tourist attraction\"" thanks to a friend's friend who couldn't make it for her weekend stay. It's not a cheap hotel so I was glad to be able to stay in a premium room at a decent price for 3D/2N. Room was huge, clean and relatively comfortable, and has a beautiful giant bathtub with separate shower facilities. And there's free WiFi and lots of cable channels including sports and movies. The rooftop infinity pool - which was the main reason that I wanted to stay here - is simply out of this world with views to kill. Just be warned: the waters are horrendously cold at all times, under both sunny and cloudy weather. Good (and expensive) food can be found at the 3 F&B outlets at the Skypark - Sky on 57, Ke De Ta and a magnificent Cheese and Chocolate buffet at The Club. Not to mention great panoramic views of course.Its location is great too: on one side there is the Marina Bay Shoppes with its branded boutiques, convenience stores and dozens of eateries and watering holes (including a theatre and casino), on the other side is the stunning Gardens by the Bay which you can easily walk to via a bridge through the hotel (you need to get out of the building to get on it via an external elevator). What prevent me from giving MBS a four-star rating is a few shortcomings in terms of service and quality of products. Most of the housekeeping staff are friendly, but the one who made up my room oddly cleaned up the bathroom and made the bed, yet failed to wash or clear all the used cups and glasses and left them on the writing desk. The breakfast buffet at Rise Restaurant looked grand with its extensive spread but the overall taste and quality is not befitting a hotel of MBS stature. And oh, the card key system for the lifts is a pure pain - the card doesn't turn green easier and by the time you make it work, the lift would have already bypass your floor. I have to teach a few other guests on how to use theirs as well.5-star for the pool and location but service and quality need to be improved.""",147
MBS,3,"“Monumental structure, but ..”","My wife and I stayed in sea view room for 4 days. We were overwhelmed by its creative architecture and huge scale. I can't imagine how much capital has been spent on this mega sized structure. Sea view from the room is spectacular and the view and experience at the skypark was unforgettable. But there were a few things needed improvements. The process at reception desk was very disappointed. Compared to the number of visitors, desk was understaffed and it's too slow. So very long wating lines were formed like the theme park. Receptionist messed up credit card process and after check out, we had to come back from changi airport to hotel. Of course, hotel arranged free shuttle car for us for this unpleasant experience. I don't want to recommend dinner buffet at Rise cafe. Foods looked creative, but we weren't happy about the taste overall.",137
MBS,2,“Marina Bay Sands is a disappointment!”,"My husband and I just returned from a 4 day trip to Singapore and a very dismal stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Although the hotel is a spectacle and something one should see, the stay there was a complete disappointment. The overcrowded lobby was a circus. Check in and Check out had 35 minute lines. The Skypark and pool were so crowded you had to wait for a chair if you wanted to enjoy it. The room was average with tired pillows and mattress and lacking in amenities and it required us to take 2 different elevators to get to the gym and then a third to get to the Skypark at the top. We will not be returning. We are troopers when we travel but for the price, this hotel is not worth it.",413
MBS,2,"“Cannot live up to its name, definitely not coming back”","Looks spectacular from the outside, but definitely not living up to its expectations.Check in- took around 40 minutes for us to check in, an extremely long line of people waiting, but only a few receptionists doing the check-ins. Overly crowded lobby, so no place to sit and wait during the check in. Very disappointing start.Room- spacious, but empty. Almost seems like they forgot to decorate the room. The bathroom was impressive though. The view from the room was definitely breathtaking (we were facing the harbor).Concierge- few things were missing in our room, and they were responding very quickly and sent us the amenities we needed. They also helped me open my suitcase because I could not find the key for the lock.Breakfast- horrific, we were thinking of going a bit early for breakfast since the amount of people in the hotel (overly crowded). We had to wait for a while to get a table (it was only 8 am). By the time we were allocated to a table there wasn't much food left in the buffet. Left empty-stomached.Pool- dreadful, at night the amount of people in the pool was immense. It almost looked like a fish tank. I was so excited about the rooftop infinity pool, but it was very disappointing. You could barely swim in the pool without getting kicked in the rib. The water was murky (I went night swimming, even more crowded than swimming at day) I do not want to know why the water is murky. So my best friend and I decided to go in the jacuzzi facing the garden, we were the first people in the jacuzzi, but then people began to pour in. So we had to leave again. So the next day we thought we would give the pool a try at day. There was a lot less people and the water was finally clear. Location- not very close to any shopping malls, or main roads (except for the ones right under Marina bay sand, there is also a casino there too) the shops were mainly very high-end, and the prices of things sky-rocketed.The museum next to the hotel wasn't very bad, but Marina bay sands definitely looks more like an tourist attraction than a five star hotel. A lot of my friends have been here a lot say its amazing but some say its not as good as expected. This hotel is definitely border line five star hotel for me. Not the best experience.",378
MBS,2,“Family/work holiday in SG”,"Horrible at first.Arrival. Waited in airport for the car MarinaBaySands arranged to pick us up. Nothing for 45 min. Took our own tai. (By the way apparently we aren't the only ones that the drivers of MarinaBaySands missed out)Upon arrival to hotel, no one took my baby stroller or our huge bags (we were there for 7 nights and had really a lot of luggage) To check-in we queued for about 15-20 mins.My husband was here for a convention but we decided to come 2 days in advance to have a little tour in Singapore and thank goodness we did! Because the cars tht we arranged for his business associate would've also been cocked up along with ours if we arrived on a later date. We wanted everything to go smooth for his business trip.At the reception we explained to the check in staff regarding our car not being at the airport to pick us up. Miki, if i remember correctly, was amazing, she knew what we needed, she got back to us on why the car wasn't there and even the manager Imren apologised for the mix up. Miki even took down my husbands business associates flight details so she could check if there was a cab arranged for him or not.We were not expecting such good service at the check in que, because the staff seemed very hustle and bustle and because of the large que.We had more worries ahead of us though, we had not arranged baby sitting. Miki was not too sure and she brought us to the lady in charge, i think her name was Germaine. She confrmed our baby sitting services.I would say, the staff, even though things were badly organised at times throughout my stay they did do their best to rectify things.MarinaBaySands definitely have good staff but the begging of our trip was very off putting having to stand in a long taxi que where we knew there was supposed to be a special car for us.Thank you to Miki and imran for a smooth departure arrangement, it really put a good note for the end our our trip.(i stayed at the ritz for New Year and it was really different, a worry free vacation. Which is what i like.)",165
MBS,2,"“Great roof, but we found rest of hotel very disappointing”","My wife and I spent two nights in the hotel. As there were not all check-in counters staffed, check-in took over 15 minutes – not in line with what we expect from a 5 star hotel which charges over 500 S$ a night for a standard room. We had a small room on the fourth floor with a very basic layout and a window which did not isolate against the noise from the busy street. We did not take breakfast as we thought they charge far too much for it. The simplified checkout did not work so I had to queue a long line with about 30 people in front of me – same story as check-in. All in all, the cost / quality is not OK. The only great thing was the roof. A fantastic pool, several nice restaurants / bars and a really breathtaking view. But paying S$ 580 for one night (includes tax, but excludes breakfast) for that view is too much.",87
MBS,3,“Best view from a pool”,"Great view from the infinity pool but continually full of guests taking photos, If you want to swim stay somewhere else. Don't forget it can be very windy on the 57th floor for the pool/Sky bar. Rooms overlooking the gardens are the best view. It is a very busy hotel and often queues for restaurants. Signage for restaurants poor, you have to ask staff. Ku Da Ta is a marvellous restaurant when you find it! Some of the very best food and staff who are very helpful.",53
MBS,3,“Overrated!”,"The only good things about this hotel is the pool upstairs plus the view on top during nighttime. But that is it! Rooms are crampy, small, a lot of hotels would have bigger rooms with the prize. For almost $400usd, not,worth it. Won't be going back anytime soon! I'd rather stay in orchard.",109
MBS,3,"“Perfect, but overpriced.”","Great place to visit one time. Very crowded. We wait for check-in and check-out long time. The matter why we wait for normal check-out was fridge. We didn't read that if you remove smth from it you will be charged. We bought some staff from 7/11 and put into fridge. While checking-out staff asked us about fridge, i explained that we did this by mistake, he filled the form and they didn't charge us. So, don't worry, they are people too. We didn't go any restaurant, 'cause they are also overpriced. We went to casino and there are no free drinks. But the views were great! Room was nice.",47
MBS,3,“So so hotel...quite expensive”,"Staying at this hotel on company expenses. First of all, the room is very beautiful, try to get ones facing the bay. there is a light show on the bay everynight from 9-11. very romantic. breakfast is excellent.Quite expensive hotel. worth staying if money is no issues.",567
MBS,1,“BEWARE OF YOUR BELONGINGS!!!”,"Nice hotel and a beautiful pool, but BEWARE OF YOUR BELONGINGS while spending time there! My dad's sandals were stolen at the pool (taken under the deck chair while I was laying in it). Something was stolen from the people sitting behind us too. Well, that can happen anywhere, but the dissapointing part was the way the staff reacted. Pool staff laughed about it and other staff members told us to go check lost & found over and over again. No result, so my dad had to walk bare feet back to our room. Maybe the staff could've at least given him hotel flip flops? Or apologize? But no. At check out I told the staff what had happened, but they too just advised me to contact lost & found again.The security policy at the pool was very strict during daytime. They checked that everyone who entered the pool area had their pool pass. BUT at night time (about 10 PM) they did not bother to check the passes and let us in. There was a queue to the bar (which is open to everyone, unlike the pool are which is for hotel guests only) too, so basically anyone could've walked in to the pool area. I gave the hotel feedback and kindly pointed out that maybe someone has got a hint about the loose \night time\"" pool policy and is now taking advantage of it. As you know, the pool is the main attraction for most guests. They replied that there is nothing wrong with the security policy and again did not offer any kind of compensation or even apologize. Needless to say, I was very disappointed on how they handled the situation. Someone had put a note on the pool area wall that included instructions (apparently intended for the hotel staff?) on how to treat guests, what questions to ask them and how to make them feel welcome. It advised them to ask the guest \""Where are you from?\"", \""How long was your flight?\"" etc... Obviously the staff had learnt these guidelines quite well. But one thing they most certainly had not heard of (or did not care about) is the \""moment of truth\"" in customer service. It is one of the very basic rules of marketing and I recommend you add that on the list too... Even the Service Management showed the same ignorance in their e-mails. So what is a \""moment of truth\""? For example, if there is a problem with the service and customer feels disappointed, it is very important that the situation is handled properly. In this case, apologize and offer some kind of compensation! Anything. A small gesture doesn't cost the hotel much. If the customer is treated right, he is most likely to be very satisfied with the service. Even more satisfied than he would've been if nothing special had happened. These \""moments of truth\"" are those that shape or change customer's opinion about the firm. In this case, otherwise an awesome and memorable first visit to MBS ended up leaving us feeling bad and never wanting to come back. Not to mention the cost, almost 800 SGD for a one night visit. Well, I guess that's MBS's take on 5-star service.I will be visiting Singapore again soon. Will I stay at MBS again? I really wish I could say yes, but after this experience, definitely not. Never again.""",720
MBS,2,“Money can be better spent”,"We were very excited to book our stay after a really tough year - we were looking forward to being made to feel a bit special. Our expectations were not met. I will try and break it down:BookingThe process was easy over the hotel website - I wasn't able to find a better rate at the time of securing the booking. Furthermore, a customer service executive mailed me in advance with some questions, so we were off to a good start. It was short-lived.Check-inWe had booked an Orchid Suite, so were supposed to have a dedicated check-in area. We were ushered to main the check-in, and only after waiting a while, did someone come and take us to a different check-in location. The process then went reasonably smoothly, although we could not access our room early. We were given temporary cards to use hotel facilities whilst we waited.RoomWe had asked for a fridge to store some food items, we were told there wasn't one available - I find this strange in a hotel this size. I don't think it's an unreasonable request - given that the cost of our room for 3 nights was probably equivalent to 20 fridges, they could have gone and purchased a small one - it would not have gone to waste.We had numerous issues with the room:1. On the first day, the alarm woke us at 6am - surely someone should switch this off before releasing the room to incoming guests?2. The sliding doors between the bedroom and the rest of the suite allow light (and some sound) through. We expected the rooms to be properly separable (a key factor in why we selected this suite) to help our kids sleep.3. The bath towels were very small - they could be more like the pool towels (and similar to other similar quality hotels.We also had numerous maintenance issues:1. Someone had to come and fix our toilet (we didn't block it) straight after we arrived.2. The left sink doesn't seal or drain very well.3. The kettle doesn't work properly (you have to hold the plug in to get it to work).4. In the middle of the afternoon, every day - something beeps, possibly the smoke alarm, not sure what it is for sure though.5. There was a whole lot of grease near the hinges on the entry door.I did articulate these issues, and would have hoped for a discount or something similar, but all we got was a ride to the airport (which had been offered to us in the other direction as a pick-up anyway, but not confirmed so we made our own way in).Amenities / ActivitiesThe hotel is rich in amenities, and I can't complain here. The pool is terrific (it was on the bucket list), we went to shops several times (very difficult to navigate) as well as the light show which was enjoyable, even for our young kids. The hotel has a casino which was pretty ordinary if you ask me. The slots didn't offer much time for one's money, and there was no poker room. At least there are separate floors for smoking and non-smoking.There are also a range of other things available which we didn't have time to use. On one occasion, we asked the concierge for a recommendation - what was recommended was completely the opposite of what we were after.FoodWe only ate at the breakfast buffet, which was reasonably presented with a reasonable selection. It was included in our room rate, but otherwise overpriced. The restaurants in the complex seem to be expensive across the board.LocationThe hotel is well located. There is easy access to the MRT (Bayfront) and there are taxi ranks outside were we never had to wait particularly long. It is very close to the Gardens by the Bay which are well worth a wonder.OverallThe hotel is large, and I found that the experience was very un-personal. I've stayed in the Ritz Carlton before, and almost felt like I was being stalked as the staff were so attentive. Furthermore, I just don't feel we got close to value for money, and there were so many little things that went wrong. I wouldn't put it on the recommend list, unless you wanted a single night there just to experience the pool - the most redeeming factor.",137
MBS,2,“Sadly dissapointing”,"Arrived after a long haul trip at night, there was only 2 staff at the front desk to do check in with a line of over 20 people, among them 2 groups of 5 people each. It look over 2 hours to do check in in a hotel that is supposed to be a luxury hotel. Very disappointing to keep you waiting like that to be able to get to bed! The hotel is like a factory! Extremely busy with no personalized attention whatsoever. The room was also a disappointment, there was no bathtub! and the isolation system of the windows is extremely poor, one can hear the noise of the street and cars all night. Yes, the swimming pool is amazing but it is just not worth it. It was not what I expected at all.",271
MBS,2,"“Bad experience, but will be staying again for Honeymoon to see if anything has changed”","Stayed in this hotel last December 2012 with a party of 3, was super excited for the experience but was left quite disappointedSimply put - there are to many people everywhere! Checked in at the was at 3pm but was only allowed in the room at 6pm. Porter had a bad attitude to start with and lost a bag to start with (was found later). The check in was long, took 30mins to reach the counter before i was told that the room was not ready until after 5pm.The room looked a bit old and dated for such a new hotel. It was a total let down coming over from Ritz-Carlton across the bay. I stayed here for 2 nights and every time I stepped downstairs there were literally hundreds of people loitering about the lobby and main walk ways. It was annoying unpleasant.I got ourselves a buy 1 get 1 free buffet package voucher , but when i tried to book a restaurant to use this offer, all of them were booked. Whats the point in giving us the vouchers if i cant even use them?Furthermore, the room service was not up to par, we kept calling up the home service for toilet rolls and bath amenities and they did not bother to send it. called them up 3 times and was only delivered an hour later.However, i am willing to give another chance to this establishment and will be returning in late January 2014 to sample this hotel again for our Honeymoon for a night. Hopefully, most of these flaws has been tidied up. I will report back soon.",184
MBS,1,“nasty surprise - think twice”,"I have stayed at the hotel on a number of occasions previously and the latest stay has been the most \memorable\"". During my 4 day- 3 night stay, two infuriating incidents that really left a bitter after taste. The first incident occurred at around noon, i answered the door to find out that they wanted to check the mini-bar. I hesitated to let them in as I was inappropriately dressed. The staff who failed to introduce himself, did not offer to return at a more convenient timing. Pissed off at their indiscretion, I called up and spoke to the Manager on duty. On the day of check-out, I was rudely woken up at 7.10am by the housekeeping staff who was all ready to make up the room! Sigh, not only did the hotel not deliver papers daily despite my request, the daily episodes I had during my stay really affected the quality of my stay. Is this there more to the hotel apart from its dazzling exterior n pool? I feel sorry for the state of affairs and level of service at this hotel""",318
MBS,3,“Show and tell”,"A very impressive looking hotel but its size and scale seem to leave it devoid of soul or personal service.Everything from check-in to check-out is a numbers game and then there’s the pressure sensitive, auto charging bar fridge. Perhaps unavoidable for a property of this size but this isn’t a motel?Rooms are nicely presented and comfortable and in a similar class to other ‘resort’ style properties in SEA such as the Venetian Macao. Room ‘make-up’ service didn’t occur until late afternoon each day during our 3 night stay but plenty of fresh towels and toiletries.The rooftop pool is impressive due to the views but it isn’t really for swimming – more a photo studio and don’t be shy as there are cameras clicking everywhere. The pool isn’t heated and was goose bump cold in the mild December weather. We visited the lobby Rise restaurant for Christmas dinner and it was poor for a 5 star hotel. We booked the second seating and while there was a large range much of the food was left-overs from the first seating and past its best. Some dishes were not even replenished. The only nod to Christmas was the roast turkey and some ogre green Christmas cookies – not even a Christmas cracker! A long way short of the quality and service available elsewhere in Singapore and the main reason for my ‘average’ rating of this hotel.In room (via TV) or express checkout (lobby touch screens) are recommended given the queues at checkout although neither system was working at the time of our checkout. You will also need to join the queue for a taxi and this system needs to be better coordinated for departing guests.Definitely a marquee hotel that’s sits perfectly with the local psyche but for me it’s really just show and tell – a hotel where you take the photos for bragging rights but leave without any lasting impression.",212
MBS,3,“Just Ok”,"First time to the hotel, did not start on a good note. We were not picked up at the airport as arranged. Our travel agent had booked our rooms which included breakfast. Not on the confirmation of the booking nor at check in was breakfast stated as being included, nor was breakfast explained. Even checked the TV room account to see if breaky was included - nothing. Though it appeared on our check out bill (too late then). Requested adjoining rooms, but could only get rooms next to each other and even then the kids had to share a king bed (wanted a twin). Rooms are ok. Visited the infinity pool - it was freezing - even for my water loving kids. We did not stay in there for long. Cancelled our airport drop off on the second day, appeared on the check out bill so went to reception and they cancelled it again and removed the charge. So 4 days later, the charge appears on the credit card statement. Lets hope that they will remove it without delay. Overall, it was ok. Been there done that, will not do it again. Would stay elsewhere where it is not as expensive for a normal room and a freezing pool and poor service.",95
MBS,3,“Come and visit it but stay elsewhere”,"Hotel is huge, also connected with shopping mall. Rooms are quite big, but be very careful, if you are on street side, there is 2 x 5 lanes street where traffic never ends, so it's very very noisy.The pool is the main reason why people book this hotel, but you have to know also this: pool is always full, not enough daybeds and it's on 57th floor, so it's always windy.Service in hotel is very good, but I'm sure you can find same or even better service somewhere else in Singapore for much less money.",272
MBS,3,“Extremely disappointing experience – buyers’ remorse!”,"We travelled as a couple and stayed 5 nights (2 Jan 2014 to 7 Jan 2014) in a city view room. We paid $600 (Singapore dollars) (excluding GST and service charge) per night.We had seen the amazing photographs of the infinity pool and that is what influenced our decision to stay at the hotel – but what a let down!Disappointments:- the $600 a night price did not include breakfast;- the room, while clean (which is what you expect) did not have a bath tub. Also, it was very much like a standard business hotel which we have both stayed out throughout Australia and Asia before. Nothing in this room was different to a Hilton, Sofitel or Westin;- there was no balcony and if you opened the doors you heard cars zooming past;- you could not pick up an item from the mini bar without being ‘automatically charged’; and- on each occasion when we went to the infinity pool on the 57th floor, we had to track down waiters to try and order a drink – it was never easy as there were a maximum 2 waiters for a large number of people.With approx. 2,500 rooms, there is no element of personal service whatsoever. The lobby is like a zoo.All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I would suggest that you consider other hotels in Singapore which have rooms which are just as nice, have more personalized service and include extras such as breakfast. If you really want to experience the infinity pool, perhaps just stay here for 1 night. Apart from the pool and the view, it is not worth staying here.",64
MBS,3,“Must visit but better to stay elsewhere”,"The hotel is great in terms of the architecture and design. It;s pool on the top of the huge boat is world wide famous, though there is not enough facilities for this crowd. The chek-in and check-out takes up to 30 min if you come around noon. The pool is full of bodies. Overall you feel like you are in the middle of Hong-Kong.",560
MBS,3,“Lacks Something.....”,"I read a great deal about this hotel prior to staying and from a distance it certainly looks like the place to stay but I was not overly impressed once I was there.I arrange limo pick up from the airport and this in turn provided us with a very personal service upon arrival taking us to the Grand Club suite room on the 19th floor of Tower One.The free wifi throughout the building and the shopping centre was unbelievably good, and I was most impressed with this service and the availability througout.The room itself was spacious, we had a balcony but no furniture which was a little weird.Ordered room service on first night and whilst the food was good, they setup the table and then when you goto eat your either on the only chair or your sitting on the sofa with your chin on the table.The room was not that well thought out, whilst the bathroom was huge, and had a nice free standing bath in order to use it they suggested closing the blind as the tub stood in front of a large window, so the ability to lie in the tub and look out was not there.Also the TV in the room faced the bed, if you sat on the sofa you could not watch it, ok you could spin it around but only if you wanted the DVD player to be dragged around also and hand off the top of the unit.The desk space was also used up by a coffee machine which could have been placed somewhere else in the vast unused spaces of the room.The Club on 57th was where I spend most of my time eating, was busy , crowded and lacked a decent selection of food bit the staff were excellent and more than made up for the poor offerings.The pool on 57th was crowded with most of the beds taken up, the infinity part of the pool made me want to go in but the sheer volume of people made it not feel comfortable.Other restaurants in the hotels app (yes in order to really find your way around you need an app for your phone) were tried and to be honest they were mostly in the shopping centre a considerable way from the hotel, some were even in the casino where the extremely rude security staff worked.The range of restaurants available was vast but from the three we tried I would only recommend one of them, the others were just average or below average.Went to the bar under tower 2, it felt like I was sitting in a corridor, also sitting at the sides means you dont see the band, and 80% of the seating was on the sides, its a very strange and odd arrangement.The casino security staff are just rude, I realise they need to have a security check but its excessive and worse that getting into a country, they scurtinise the passport the picture, scan it and then check where you have been, I asked why this was and was told that it was their job to check, it was mostly unwelcoming......if I am honest next time I will go back to Venetian in Macau.I used the automated checkout machine when leaving this was really quick and easy.Overall impressive building, massive potential, but I never felt relaxed there",726
MBS,3,“Perfect View of New Year's Fireworks”,"Check in could've been faster but perhaps because it was the Chistmas season, there were more guests than usual. I actually upgraded my booking to a Premier room but was given a cheaper City View room. I did not point this out to the check-in staff as I thought I'd see the room first and then mention it the cheaper room were not to our liking. As it turns out, the cheaper room were more than what we needed.Luggage was handled promptly and carefully. The bellhop (Edwardo, if I remember correctly), answered all questions like a concierge and even gave us several bottles of water seeing that there were 4 of us.The view over the Marina Bay, Esplanade, Financial Center, etc. is fantastic. The room size is very good. The toilet and bath were opulent. The king size bed and the extra bed were comfortable. We ordered dim sum from room service on Christmas eve and were satisfied--considering expectations were high for (hotel-priced) Chinese food in Singapore.However, there are a number of little problems that prevent us from rating our stay higher.First, the mini-bar is equipped with RFID to auto-magically charge guests for any bottle/can that moved. As we had kids in the room, I requested for the fridge to be emptied so I do not have to deal with billing issues at check out. I was offered a 2nd, empty mini-fridge--nice thought but that wasn't why I wanted the mini-bar emptied. I left housekeeping a note to explain again and I got a note back saying there is an SGD20 fee to empty the mini-bar. For the price I am paying for the room, why is the hotel nickel and diming me for a simple request that would've made our stay more relaxed so we don't have to keep reminding the kids to not play with the minibar?The pool at the rooftop is a must do experience--no visit would be complete without. The water was very chilly on first dip but stay in and acclimatise. Hardware-wise, the pool was a 5 star experience. But software-wise, the lifeguards allow people who are not in proper swim attire (regular t-shirts and shorts) to frolic in the otherwise magnificent pool. There were photographers at the pool who will take your photo and then sell you a photo book / print but they use a point and shoot camera and the poor lady photographer was shivering. For the price they charge (SGD85 for a print vs. ~SGD25 at places like Universal Studios, Singapore Zoo, etc.), I'd expect a properly-equipped professional--at least give the poor photographer a tripod to steady the camera!Another suggestion for the roof top is to strengthen the security at the lifts on the ground floor. On a number of occasions, we found ourselves waiting unnecessarily for entry into the pool because non-guests find their way up without the right tickets to go to the viewing deck end up arguing with the poor hotel staff on why they cannot buy their tickets right there. I'd further suggest to sell the tickets right at the deck but at a steep premium vs. buying online or at the correct counter at the ground floor. Taxis were always easy and plentiful but while the Bayfront station of the efficient Singapore MRT serves the hotel, the MRT lines are obviously not quite finished (the Circle line isn't quite a circle yet) requiring changes at the next station even for the short destinations--can be quite a hassle with small kids. We've stayed at Swissotel Stamford (City Hall station on MRT) and at Mandarin Orchard (Orchard station) before and never had this problem.The gym equipment and view were fantastic. Sadly, we had no time to try the spa.Be mindful of your flight time and work back the time you need to check out carefully. If you need to check out at the hotel's standard time of 11am / mid-day, a lot of other people are checking out so lifts and the queue at check out can take a long while.We'd attribute the mixed experienced we had at this hotel to the fact that its core business is the casino. As we do not gamble, we're probably not the prime target market. The rest of the hotel seemed to be a mish-mash of different concessionaires thus causing a disjointed, sometimes great, sometimes frustrating experience.",50
MBS,2,"“Over priced and over hyped, lousy service..”","extremely poor service, long queue to check in and check out.. very ordinary room, every facility including the much hyped pool is crowded like a railway station.definitely not worth the money they asked for..any of the marina bay area 5 stars is more comfortable and cheaper..will never stay there again!!",296
MBS,2,"“Overcrowded, Overpriced, Overblown”","I stayed at the Marine Bay sands from 3/1/14-5/1/14. We had planned this for months ahead as this is certainly an architectural marvel. Having said that I was deeply disappointed . I have read reviews on trip adviser .Be aware that the positive reviews re service are usually written by people that have payed a vast amount extra for club service and suites. I am also not interested in gambling The hotel is vast . You are one of a massive crowd and that is the people staying there apart from the endless surge of other visitors which turn the place into a very busy transit station.We were checked in after some queueing and this was reasonably satisfactory although very cold and impersonal. We moved our cases from tower 1 to tower 3 dodging crowds as we went .Our room was clean and reasonably comfortable , 4 star. At this point I was beginning to wonder about the value of our stay . To my horror I discovered that anything touched in the fridge had to be payed for . I detest this and find it incredibly tacky . 2star really and certainly not 5 star.The pool was worth going to although we were incredibly lucky to have a pool side lounger to lie on . Once again very busy . No rest and peace here .Our view was outstanding , across the bay and over the gardens which are on reclaimed land .For A$450.00 per night I was hoping for quiet , calm and careful service . There was none of that . I felt that once checked in we were on our own. My advice is pay to go to the Sky Bar and then pay for a luxury hotel somewhere else in Singapore",78
MBS,3,“Without the roof-top pool and view the hotel is very ordinary and way over-priced”,"Admittedly the roof-top pool and view are second-to-none, but take that away and there is a reasonably sized but very ordinary hotel room that doesn't match the hefty price tag (and breakfast not included). I can see why on some websites MBS is rated only at #34 out of 250+ hotels in Singapore - many others in Singapore have far nicer ambience, service and rooms. Perhaps the room is ordinary hoping you spend more time at the casino???",34
MBS,3,"“Terrible service, expensive rates”","Shoddy construction, terrible service, crowded lobbies, rude staff... why would you pay top dollar for such a third rate experience? Much better off staying at the Raffles Hotel or the Swissotel in downtown Singapore.",404
MBS,3,“The pool is the best bit”,"My husband and I checked in on 1 January 2014 and stayed for 3 nights. We were greeted by a very friendly Jun Wei who checked us in but advised our room would not be ready until 1:00 or 2:00pm. After looking a little disappointed, Jun Wei did some magic and was able to give us a room right then and there. On the 10th floor of Tower 3.My husband was a little disappointed after learning we had to change to a different lift in order to get to the gym/spa/sauna/pool. So we went back and had a chat - again this time greeted by the very friendly and helpful Jun Wei who advised all the rooms were taken now however, he could get us a room tomorrow on the 42nd floor and that way we would not need to change lifts to get to the gym etc. which we frequented often. We were very thankful for this.We were very happy and pleased with the way Jun Wei greeted us, treated us, was patient with our annoying requests and never let his smile off his face. He should be greatly commended as his dedication to customer service was amazing. Having said that, the pool is probably the best part of this hotel. But let's not kid ourselves - the reason why we chose MBS was because of the pool and having now seen it and experienced it, I do not think I would go back. The hotel itself lacked that warm \hotel\"" kind of feeling you get but rather felt more like a convention centre or an airport terminal. The staff were nice and friendly once you were able to get to someone. The concierge desk was really helpful with chasing up our airport transfer for us.The buffet breakfast had a good range however, I found a lot of the foods sitting in bain-maries were cold. There was one morning where I was sad to see the rice congee was empty but then someone was coming with a new pot. To my disappointment, the new batch was cold for some reason.The location was great - it was not far to walk the MRT station via the underground passage. All in all, we had a good 3 nights here, but now that we can say \""been there, done that\"" I dont think we will pay the same amount of money to come back here again.""",52
MBS,3,“A very expensive swim.”,"We had some issues here. Stay one night. Enjoy the pool, then go stay somewhere where you are less captive to their exorbitant food costs. The slippers and the pool lounge house coats are not sized for North American people. Way too small and when I requested larger I was not understood.",123
MBS,3,"“Stunning architecture and view from the top, average hotel”","Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino is a absolutely stunning structure in the heart of Singapore. To be fair, the brilliant architecture probably raised my expectation for the hotel rooms. And I was disappointed. The rooms were very average, standard of a 4 star hotel in Asia. Nothing special. The best perk for staying here though, is that the room key gets you access to the rooftop infinity pool. With the skyline of Singapore on the backdrop, the view is absolutely amazing. What ruined it for me a bit was just how many people there were. I went up at about 9pm to find the pool and the whole area were completely crowded. Other than that, there wasn't much highlight to stay here.",79
MBS,3,“Mass-Luxury to show off”,"Obviously interesting architecture of the structure and wonderful panorama from the 57th floor infinite pool, but the customer service and the lines for check in and check out are not that of a luxury service. You are a number, the overall is quite efficient but forget personal attention. I had a midnight flight and after checkout they wouldn't even let us access to the swimming pool...basically we had to get out of the hotel. Overpriced for the service offered.",64
MBS,3,“Good service but too crowded”,We stayed there in November and was expecting the service to be better than what was received. Upon check in there was no bell man whatsoever to help us(or even greet you) get luggage to the reception area. The swimming pool view was stunning but overcrowded that you only have small spaces for a few strokes. Overall its a nice property but too commercialized,398

MBS,2,“Gobsmacked !!”,"We were bitterly disappointed with the standard of MBS ! We booked into Club Rooms for a 10 day trip, envisaging pure luxury with a private club lounge in which we can relax but sadly we were to be faced with scenes of a cattle market !!We have used Club rooms in the Hyatt group, Starwood group, Intercontinental , Atlantis Dubai etc etc.. and we had expected the same standard at MBS. Are we wrong ?Catalogue of incidents - we wanted to have a tea/coffee with family members who had come to meet us and after enquiring if we could use the lounge, we were asked for a S$50.00 cover charge - other hotels have never asked for that ! At breakfast, service staff looked hassled and not quite as well trained , resulting in hot beverages being split over my husband and I - we left immediately and when the lounge manager met my husband she apologised and said the most ludicrous comment we have ever heard from management within a hotel - \ please do not think we did that on purpose\"" ???? My husband was incredulous and replied that why should we think that.....??? This particular lady actually shooked her head and appeared quite haughty when we tried to make conversation when we were waiting in a long Q for breakfast ! Needles to say - our laundry for that day was NOT waivered !Our daughters's godmother lives in S'pore and when we told her the events, she called the Service Manager and we did have a polite gentleman come to our room to just diplomatically accept our comments !!We did NOT use the so-called Club facilities anymore after day one ! No one within Club Room Customer services bothered to find out why - as any good F&B dept should do as they should know who their customers are ! Coming to F&B, the one day we have used the lounge for breakfast, we found the choice sadly lacking - compared to our next 2 legs of our holidays - KL at the Mandarin Oriental and then at The Pangkor Laut Resort.One bright and shining star during our stay at MBS is a lady called Glynn at the Fuse Bar - she was a warm welcome and made our nightly drinks at Fuse something to look forward to ! We can go on and on......all we want to say is we did not expect the sort of service - clearly a \""no can do\"" spirit from a Temasek owned 5 star establishment !!!!""",239
MBS,3,“Worth going once”,"I go to singapore a lot, did two stays at the Marina Bay Sands last year.Upside is, location is pretty good, gotta go to the pool once, and the suite rooms are large, with very large windows in the living room and next to the bathtub. Concierge was good about getting restaurant reservations, and email communications was good.Downside is, despite the huge number of rooms, I've never gotten early checkin. On both visits, I asked them to call when a room was available, but no call. Singapore has fantastic hotels - Raffles, Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, and with them, I've never NOT gotten early checkin. Could be small number of suite rooms. Pool is great, but on closer look, full of kids, some in diapers. There is nothing wrong with the hotel - Sands did a great job on the pool, and bar / restauruant area by the pool. It's just too big to provide any level of personalized or good service. It's sort of like staying in a giant convention Hilton or Hyatt, but with much better rooms and common areas. So yes, there is \VIP\"" checkin, but that will have a line of folks all demanding high floors and asking for an upgrade. Sending luggage down at checkout will result in delays at the front while hotel people try to find the right pieces. It's a nice convention hotel. Either buy into it, or stay at the Raffles.""",121
MBS,3,“Too expensive”,"I think you should stay one night at this hotel, just to see the great view of the city, but as many things in Singapore, the hotel is very expensive compared to what you get. The checin line is very long, and we were told that we were lucky that our room was available, as the normal time is 3 PM. And when you checkout it is before 11 AM. Of course everything is nice in the room, which should be expected for a hotel of this standard. The breakfast at the hotel is also very expensive, so I would recommend to either eat at another place, or to buy the breakfast deals.I would probably not stay at this hotel again.",48
MBS,2,“nice hotel but poor management”,nice hotel but poor management....i stay for 2 days but when i check in i have to wait for 5 hour for my second room keys even i called a hundred times but the answer only...still clean the room....everybody feels tired but they need to wait 5 hour....,113
MBS,3,"“Not 5 star, just a very large hotel”","This hotel is not 5 star, you have to queue up like at an airport to check in. Then once you get up to your rooms it is very standard, no bath just a shower, room was large but felt on the empty side, there is no surprise or delight in the rooms or in any of the public spaces other then of course the swimming pool on the roof. Worth staying there for one night just to explore the pool and the excellent view out over Singapore. But as far as 5 star service from staff or attention to detail then you need to go to another hotel, not a tourist attraction.",130
MBS,2,“Forget about it... unless you get a great deal”,"If you are looking for an impersonal, cold and monolithic Hotel, then the MBS is the hotel for you. It is devoid of character and personal touches. It is meant for the big convention type groups or those coming fo the casino who will not be spending any time in the hotel anyway. When I travel for business, i like a hotel that caters to me personally. MBS does not. it is clean and shine and new, but there are so many better hotels in Singapore to enjoy, don't bother with the MBS ... unless you get an unbelievable deal.BTW - you will need to take a taxi everywhere given its remote location. It's one redeeming quality is the SkyPArk for the view and the infinity pool. But thats it!",700
MBS,1,“Marina asked us to sell our 3 rooms for 4 Seasons.”,"Booked & paid for 3 Premier rooms for (4 nights) new years eve 6 months ago. Sent emails requesting for extra bed due to 2 small Children. Was so excited to Check-in this architectural marvel, specially after being pampered so well by Dusit Phuket for 4 nights (Christmas) & a comfortable flight with smooth transit to Marina. Just when I was about to give my details on Tower 3 front desk, a gentleman (Mr Rahate) from the back office came & whiskered me to side to Ask for the most annoying thing any traveler would die of shock, when checking in – “Dear Sir- Can I request you to change from Marina to other hotel, Sir I am so sorry but we are over-booked”. After completely refusing his request (which we all regretted later), I reminded them about other 2 rooms Guests who were on way to Marina from Airport. The Gentleman again tried and then asked for 15 mins. I then called back my travel agent –told them I will sue you guys when I come back, they were shocked. I got a call back from the GM of my travel agent company to take a stand & not leave the front desk at any cost, as he has already spoken & complained directly to Hotel management for this behavior. That worked & I got my share of Premier Room after 45 mins of this drama. I paid my security deposit and checked in a clean Premier Room. Now Please see the following little little incidents which followed :-• My other 2 Couple friends were made to wait 30 mins for check in. They reached hotel after having lunch at airport, around 3:55 pm.• The wheel of my suitcase was broken due to mishandling ( they repaired it ).• The handle of suitcase of my Friend was damaged/torn due to mishandling. It cant be repaired.• Luggage of other 2 occupants reached their rooms at 5:30pm after one hour due to heavy traffic.• I slept on floor on all 4 nights above a single duvet due to non-availability of an extra bed by world’s most expensive Casino-Hotel. I asked if I could purchase a single Mattress for myself, but they refused its against their policies.• All three rooms mini bars were locked & all three of us begged to open so we can keep milk for our babies. They said due to non payment of security they have locked it. We again begged them to check their receipts they gave us for security deposit. This went with 3 different operators and finally our mini bars were opened and cleaned to make way to keep baby milk. I must say this Hotel needs to change the team working at Front Desk. You don’t feel like a guest when you enter its huge lobby, you feel like one of the shoppers who are constantly going in & out. The services are poor. Sensitivity to hotel guest is bare minimum, specially with small children. I would say they wasting such a beautiful & young property with such in-efficient working staff. It is actually a Business Hotel, with amazing shopping mall & wi-fi coverage. I would not recommend to stay in this hotel if you have small children. They could have installed wind-blockers glasses or fiber-glass sheets on the terrace of 57th to enjoy the pool (which is windy & uncomfortable most of the time due to height).  In the end all three of us got rewards of 100 + 100 + 87 dollars on our food bills (which were more then 500 dollars), with free limo drop-off for one of my friends to airport from Hotel from Front desk Sheriff – Ms Jennie Arboleda. All of us are very regular to Singapore, cuz we live near & we love Changi airport as pit stop for 2-3 days, but this time was bad due to Marina’s rude behavior. Marina cannot compete with Four Seasons, Taj, Dusit hospitality. I mean these players they know their names before you even come to their Gates. Marina is purely a Casino Mall with rooms with Great Shopping experience. Better to visit as a shopper then stay as guest.",71
MBS,3,“Magnificent view from the top”,"the view from the top is magnificent and stunning. viewing the city at night with lights on everywhere was really awesome. we had a glimpse of the garden by the day, the bridge, the highway, the eyes sparkling with lights. unfortunately, the area for visitors who are not the hotel guest was limited. we only managed to stroll along the corner of the rooftop. unable to visit the famous infinity pool,",354

And of course this \Zoo\"", I can't think a better name for this zoo, first is so ridiculous expensive with no lobby , people are sitting around the tree inside the hotel! Such a joke for a 5 start hotel! Inside this zoo you must need a number to indentify you ... You are no MR or Miss... You are room number!OMG! When you have breakfast is almost $ 100 US dollars or two people for a Buffet ! With no fresh juices ever so ever !

MBS,3,“Like staying at a Shopping Centre”,"We’ve just completed a three-night stay at MBS over the new-year. We chose it because of the views of the Singapore new-years eve fireworks and on that front we’re not disappointed. There are many things that work at MBS and many things that don’t. Let me start with the positive:Architecturally the building is amazing – from the foyer inside with a forest of trees in massive pots to the outside – from ever angle the building is impressive and you can’t help stop and look up.The view – we opted for a Club Room which was located on level 37 in tower two, facing the marina – it couldn’t have been better for new-years eve – smack bang in the middle facing right onto the fireworks. It was the ideal location for ‘dinner for two’ seated next to the windows in our room.The pool – located on level 57, again this is another architectural feat. You can’t help want to hang over the edge of the infinity pool watching Singapore below.The Club – our advice is pay the extra for a Club Room that gets you access to the Level 57 Club – providing breakfast until 11.00 am each day, complimentary afternoon tea and complimentary cocktails (not really cocktails, but more open bar). The front desk staff at the Club are to be congratulated on their personal service. Always remembering my name upon approach and nothing was too much trouble.Now the negative – there is no getting away from the sheer size of this place. It felt like we were checking in to a shopping centre. Even though we were able to use the ‘Club’ check-in lane at Tower One the service was insanely slow. Not because the staff aren’t doing their job but the process just takes too long. Either they are not employing enough staff or they need to get a process analyst in and determine why every check-in is so long. Its crazy. It was painful checking in, and doubly painful checking out (and we checked in and out late).The room – whilst a Club Room is large its pretty basic. The bathroom is nice (large shower, separate toilet) but the air conditioning is hopeless. There is a sign under the air conditioning control pointing out it takes some time to cool the room. In my experience it took about 6 hours to get the room to drop by 2 degrees. Even though it was set to 18 degrees (I like it cold) it never got bellow 22.5 on the screen. Also the wardrobe in this room is tiny. By the time my partner half unpacked I had to leave all my clothes in the bag. Its also noisy, a fair amount of ambient noise from outside (ear plugs unfortunately necessary). Also whilst we were on a non-smoking floor the corridor on Level 37 smelt of smoke most of the time. When I mentioned the smoking issue to the front desk they just brushed it off.Lack of personal service – If we weren’t staying in a Club Room I’d hate to think what it might have been like. For the price we paid I expect a lot more personal service.The pool – impressive as it is to look at it really doesn’t work. Its too busy, too noisy, there is no drinks/food service (or none we experienced) and during our stay too many children. Once you spend 15 mins on the view you start to hanker for something way less popular/common.Would we go back? No. Would we recommend this hotel? If you want to ‘try it once’ then get into the zone where you could be staying at a shopping centre or a very busy train station. But for me, the next time in Singapore I’ll be staying at a much more personal hotel with better service at a cheaper price for sure.",60
MBS,3,“Overpriced hotel”,Don't stay here. Why? The lobby is like a busy market place. The situation where one cannot touch the minibar is more like a $50 motel than a luxury hotel. There is nowhere to have a quiet drink in the evening. The room itself does nor compensate. There is no bath in the room. Not acceptable. I feel ripped off.,371
MBS,3,“Worst Club Room Facilities”,"I've stayed there numerous times. While the occupancy rate clearly kept going up, sad to say, the quality of the hotel only kept going down. My earlier review of this same hotel seem like it was of a totally different establishment. To be fair, service from the staff remained top notch. They strive to provide a level of service that will make any guests feel comfortable. Unfortunately the management failed to follow with similar level of quality facilities and amenities.I used to look forward to breakfast at The Rise. Too bad the quality of food has deteriorated much. Others may find it still good but if you've been a regular at the hotel, the drop in quality is disappointingly obvious. This hotel has the worst Club Room facilities of all the hotels I've stayed in. There is no Club Lounge. There is exclusive place for club guests to relax, have a drink and generally have some down time. The hotel seems to think all club members are only interested in free food and drinks. Therefore, the only facility provided to club guests is a restaurant that is only opened for breakfast, tea, and cocktail. All other times it is a regular restaurant. Food served during the the three periods are at best mediocre. Check in is at the VIP Lounge which is a small crowded room where the guests are made to stand in sometimes long queues. This used to be a relaxed area with hot and cold drinks where guests can wait to be checked in while reading the newspapers over coffee or tea. Now, I suggest you check in at the wide airy lobby where though the wait is just as long, at least there is live music entertainment and one is not cooped up in a little room. The final verdict is, after having stayed there a number of times since it opened, I won't be going back until it improves. On the other hand, it is always so crowded that I fear the management may not feel the need to do anything more. Guests just keep coming in droves every time I've been there. It is quite sad really since I really loved this architecturally iconic hotel.",255
MBS,3,“Too crowded”,"This is our 2nd Stay at MBS, both being 1 night staycation. We love the room and the gigantic bathtub, the view, comfortable bed, nice balcony, air-con comfortable. The cons is the hotel swimming pool is too crowded. There are very few jacuzzi and hardly able to try it. The children pool is also very boring and given that many came with kids, the pool is too disappointing even for an average hotel. Infinity pool is nice if you prefer to see the view, otherwise the pool is not conducive for swimming at all as its too crowded with many people though the pool is big. For kids i will advise that you get a room with the gigantic bathtub instead and let them play at the bathtub since its so much more interesting than the swimming pool. Moreover the pool level is very cold with big wind.Breakfast is at the swimming pool level and the view is great. Food selection is however considered little as compared to other comparable hotels in SG or Malaysia. We wanted to try the buffet dinner on the night of the stay but they were too crowded and we were told to wait for the 2nd round but at 8.15pm, they told us it is still too full and not available. They should have given priority to hotel guests instead and I felt that the service is lacking. We ended up eating at the Chinese restaurant just next to the buffet and it is superb but also not cheap.",253
MBS,2,“Spectacular view - But needs better management”,"The view from the pool of Marina Bay Sands is truly remarkable and the city view Club rooms at set up perfectly to make the most of the Marina Bay Vista as it transforms from day to night.I travel extensively throughout the year, so as a Singapore resident the idea of a \staycation\"" was very appealing. We are leaving Singapore soon for a new assignment and 2 nights at MBS was on our bucket list. But I must say, the reservation, arrival and check in was the worst I have experienced in many years and my fear is that it is the spectacular location that will prevent hotel management from even caring if they provide good service. We waited 5 hours on Xmas day for our second room to become available, with promises of phone calls to update, but nothing. A late checkout our only compensation. I would love to see this hotel run like a W-hotel, or Conrad.The Club room breakfast and happy hour are on par with most hotels in this price range. The pool is crowded, icy cold, but a real highlight.Valet parking is cheap, slow and disorganized. Checkin is confusing and apparently not connected to the multiple communications leading up to the stay.My recommendation, go buy a drink at Ku De Ta for the view from the top, but stay at Marina Mandarin for great service, a great pool also, and you get to look at the beautiful MBS complex, something you cannot see from the MBS hotel itself!""",87
MBS,3,“A one time stay experience”,"I booked a room at Marina Bay Sands with excitement, especially knowing we'd have a chance to swim in its famous rooftop pool. But to be honest other than that and the city view, nothing is really special. Plus, it's quite a distance to the city. You should stay here if you really want to enjoy the amenities, shopping, and going to the casino or gardens by the bay. I personally would rather stay in the city. It was a good once in a lifetime experience though.",69
MBS,2,“Impressive Architecture but........”,"Very impressive hotel when driving up but.....The rooms are generic hotel, first night here at 1am and curtains won't close. Had to wait a long time to check in.Man tried to fix curtains and offered to change rooms, at 1.30?????I would recommend 1 night, do pool and then go to a more established hotel. Went back for a Cocktail at Shangri-La and had impeccable service.Just a 1 day experience.",86
MBS,3,“Visit to Singapore”,"Rooms are exceptionally clean and location is breath taking. Amenities are amazing. Problem is with check in and check out. It took more than 30 min to check in at the reception, not because it is crowded at 3:00 a.m. in the morning, but it is due to micromanagement by a remote office over phone. Reception staff can not assign a room without talking to the remote office. Hotel lobby is always like a market place, very noisy because the hotel is attached to a casino.",135
MBS,1,"“Over charged, Over Advertised, Under Whelmed”","The lack of service, poor suit amenities and staff numbers combines perfectly with this hotels dreadful and overpriced food.This, so called hotel, is totally dependent on its main attraction the ‘ sky park’, their infinity pool is an amazing feet of engineering and one could enjoy magnificent views of the city amongst the thrashing foam caused by the throng of people bathing in it.However, if you are looking for the usual 5 star hotel service, food and amenities select any other 5 star hotel in Singapore! You may consider staying for one night at this ‘Faulty Towers’ to gain access to the Sky Park pool. One night would be enough, make sure you eat at any other restaurant outside the hotel and then move to another hotel for the rest of your stay in Singapore.",177
MBS,3,"“Nice Architecture, the rest is average”","The hotel building itself is a grand architecture; an amazing sight. The hotel has a enormous casino and the world famous infinity pool is worth the stay. There is a nice shopping center attached to the hotel, so convenience factor is a plus. Other than that, the rest is pretty average compared to similarly priced hotels in Vegas. The service is good, but waiting time is horrible. The room (Grand Club Room) is SPACIOUS but seems empty because there aren't enough fixtures to fill the room. The decor of the room is just so-so, falls short compared to other 4-5 star hotels. The carpet seems dingy and the fixtures seem old. However the bathroom is luxurious with nice shower and bathtub. The worst part is the food. The food served in the hotel lobby restaurant (buffet style) is not very good and over priced. Breakfast is better, but lunch and dinner is definitely not worth it. You can walk to the food court in the shopping center and enjoy great variety of food at very reasonable prices.",156
MBS,3,“All the Charm of Las Vegas”,"MBS has all the charm of Las Vegas, which means, ain't much. The swimming pool on the 57th floor is frightening, with a straight drop down off the edge. But the Club is wonderful, with great food and terrifically friendly staff. Sadly, that's about the best that can be said about this place. The lobby is about as appealing as a garage, while the rooms are adequate. The casino downstairs is fiulled with pensioners and Chinese tourists losing their money, while the shopping mall has every designer store you ever heard of at prices that make Paris feel like a bargain. Staff at MBS can be friendly, but it depends on the day. Very iffy. There's a reason why the best hotel in Singapore is Raffles, and not this place. If you can't afford Raffles (at least visit because it is spectacular), then the Fairmont or even the Ritz Carlton is a better bet than MBS.",173
MBS,3,“One and only one reason to go: the swimming pool”,"Welcome to Las Vegas in Singapore! At Marina Bay Sand everything is big (the hotel and number of rooms, restaurants...) and this starts with the checking counters where it is normal to wait in a queue (and the same at check out). In this case big means also that you should not expect any particular attention from the personal.The rooms are all very different depending on the category and up to the standard of world-class 5-stars hotels without any plus. In our case we had been upgraded to a suite as this was a special occasion for me (I had informed the hotel before coming). This was really appreciated!So is it worth staying at Marina Bay considering the expensive price? Yes, because of the swimming pool (only accessible by hotel residents) which is unique. You can see breathtaking views from Singapore skyline which makes it a great experience!To summarize I would strongly suggest to have a short stay there to enjoy the pool but if staying longer in Singapore, consider a second hotel.",62
MBS,3,“Iconic hotel”,"Stayed here for 3 days on a business trip. Lavish rooms with nice view. World's best and highest roof top swimming pool. Staff is not co-operative, they gave me a smoking room while I requested for a non smoking one. They incorrectly charged me for one extra day which was later rectified, but had to file dispute with credit card for this.",233
MBS,3,“Overhyped. Overcrowded and Overpriced but still acceptable”,"The Venetian and Lisboa in Macau, and Marina Bay Sands are the same place *very crowded*Spending $500/night wasn't surely worth but still it was acceptable. It's like a status symbol for you of you're staying here.Rooms below $500 doesn't gives you access to the Sky Pool which is the only unique thing this hotel gives. But sadly even after spending $500 i saw people that were not guests at all and were enjoying comfortably the pool. This is because the place is so overcrowded that nobody knows you not even by the face. If you are a guest in the hotel you get a pass that gives access to the pool but the pass is normally a piece of paper with no identity proof and can be easily made several number of times. If a outsider gets a replica then you're allowed which is a major drawback.This hotel surely isn't top 10 properties in Singapore. The breakfast was huge gives you all the cusines but still was messed up as it was in the hotel lobby which is too much busy. Not at all good place to have your breakfast there. The Shoppes at Marina Bay is a very big and really amazing mall where you can buy from high end brands to the normal ones. Specially the Louis Vuitton Store.This is a mixed review and you can get better in Singapore.Try Ritz!",340
MBS,1,"“Its like we got punished for not trusting Tripadvisor reviews : Impersonal, too big, too crowded!”","This was the first time we went against bad Tripadvisor reviews or went below the top 25 hotels, and let me say that we shouldn't have as all the bad reviews are most likely true. The good ones are probably true too but our personal experience was a huge let down. First of all, the reservations desk NEVER responded to our Expedia hotel requests or all our emails which we started sending 3 months prior to our arrival, so we were not able to arrange for any in room special surprise or amenities for our special celebration and the reason why we were in Singapore, so were not able to request or get any upgrades. When we told the concierge at arrival, they could not care less.This was the hotel we were the most excited about and sadly it was the biggest let down.The restaurants across the hotels are very good so you can stay at better hotels (ex: Raffles, Ritz, Peninsula, 4 Season, take your pick out of any of the top 20 list.) and still pay to access the pool for a day and the restaurants or clubs.The hotel is pure Las Vegas type of flash and way way too crowded and without 5* US high end customer service standards or even Asian hospitality standards. A the property is already getting run down.Too big, too crowed, no personal attention. The only thing good is the pool, yes its amazing but again very crowded. You can't reserve cabanas and there are kids running EVERYWHERE, all hours of day. You can still go see the pool if you stay at a better hotel.We travel to 5 stars hotels and resorts worldwide so we expected more from the Marina Bay Sands. This makes us never want to go to any Sands property. Its rare we post bad reviews because we rely so much on tripadvisor reviews but this time we were tempted by the look. Next time it will be the Raffles, Peninsula or the Ritz but never again the MBS.",484
MBS,3,“Will not be returning due to poor service”,"We stayed here for our honeymoon as a couple for 2 nights. Staff at check in seemed bored of what they were doing. She advised us of pool closing times, but provided no other details about transportation or nearby tourist attractions as most hotels tend to do upon check in. Upon entering the room I was both appalled and discussed to find hair from previous occupants both on the pillow and bed sheets. I immediately call the front desk to advise them of the situation. Only to be greeted by a gentleman who had no idea how to deal with complaints. Could hear a lady in the background telling him what to say. He offered no apology, no compensation whatsoever. Just asked what I wanted. After an exhausting flight, decided to let it go. Only to then find rubbish wrappers on the floor which had no been cleaned properly. Again I called the front desk to advise to be given a poor response. Once again no apology, just said that housekeeping will be notified and someone can come clean if required. I advised this was not necessary as by now I was tired of dealing with them and did not want further disturbances. No apology or compensation was ever offered. This is all within 15 minutes of entering the hotel. It was enough to put anyone in a sour mood. An upgrade or free breakfast at least would have been nice!On our last night I called to check if late check out was a possibility, knowing that some hotels offer it as goodwill. Our flight was at 8pm the next day, and standard check out is at 11am. I was advised it could be extended until 12pm which is a nice gesture, and to call back in the morning to have it extended till later. We called back in the morning to be told no and we need to pay. I understand very well that the hotel is not obliged to provide late check out and that it's subject to availability. But in that case staff should not be giving the wrong information to customers. It got escalated in the end and we were 'suddenly told' there are rooms available and we can late check out.On a good note, the bathroom was spacious and the beds comfortable. We chose to stay mainly to experience the infinity pool, which was not a let down. However, we do regret not listening to complaints about service as it all proved true. Paying $500 a night, the service received was shocking and definitely not worth the money paid. Take your money elsewhere. There are other nice hotels who provide great service for a much more affordable price I am sure. Will not be returning again, simply due to this horrid experience, being the downfall for our honeymoon :( Disappointed for what would have otherwise been a lovely hotel.",389
MBS,3,“Cattle Call”,"Beginning with the 'VIP' check-in cattle call, which resembled checking in for an economy class international flight, our stay at MBS was a mediocre experience. As opposed to the nearby Ritz-Carlton, where you will be met at the hotel entrance by an employee who already knows your name and efficiently whisks you up to your room for a very personalised and relaxing experience, a (pricier) club level room at MBS allows you to check in at a 'VIP' lounge where we were met with a 30 minute line. It may have even been a longer wait than that for the main registration area, complete with competitive queue cutting a la Jurong East MRT station at rush hour. This is unacceptable for what is purported to be a 5-star hotel (much less \6 star\""). We understand that MBS is a particularly large property, but even the Venetian in Las Vegas (also a gigantic LVS property) manages to pull off a much better check-in and overall club level experience. Generally speaking staff are competent, but highly impersonal. The club lounge's location at the wildly crowded pool creates an inhospitable atmosphere in which the staff have no idea who you are even after multiple days, and are constantly questioning guests in order to ascertain whether or not they're allowed into the lounge. Even so, the lounge is often at full capacity, and there seems to frequently be a line to even enter. Would be shocked to see this sort of thing at 'comparable' Singapore hotels like Four Seasons, St. Regis, Mandarin Oriental. To be fair, offerings at the lounge are very respectable, and the view can't be beat. Rooms are also nicely appointed and seem to be well looked after despite the high levels of traffic. The pool is incredible and the main reason I charitably assigned the overall property 3 stars rather than 2...certainly an extremely unique, value-adding amenity. While it feels a bit like a water-park on the weekends given the huge crowds, it seems to calm down a bit on Sunday and into the weekdays. The atmosphere at night is particularly enjoyable. Unless you are extremely keen on utilising the pool, stay at one of Singapore's myriad other truly 5 star properties where service is actually a primary concern. You'll probably save a good deal of money as well.""",338
MBS,1,“Overcharged!”,"Me and my friends had a pleasant stay at MBS last Nov 24-25, 2013. I used 2 cards to pay for my stay there: 1 for the room rate & another for the $200 deposit.But when I checked my acct on Nov 26, I have noticed that I was over charged with another $600, aside from the room rate that was deducted.Yes, I know that there was a $200 deposit, and I have used another card for it. I also know that it would be released 5-10 days after my stay at the hotel. But charging me with another $600 is way too much. I never expected it from a prestigious hotel like this. They should train staff to be more vigilant when it comes to money matters.I tried to call MBS front desk account officers a number of times, and the best answer I got was that they were sorry for the human error that their front desk staff has made & they have already emailed their issuing bank to process the release of my money.Full stop. I have talked to my bank (POSB) & they informed me that they are just waiting for MBS/the issuing bank to give them a call so that they could process the release of my money immediately. MBS shouldn't have stopped doing their part by just emailing alone, since it was one of their front desk staff who did this mess. Up to this day, my money has not been refunded back to my acct yet. We don't just pick up money from the streets, y'know. We value it.Processing of refund only started on Nov 27 (3 days after my stay from MBS). If I wouldn't have informed the MBS staff on that day, then processing the release of money would not have been done. I hope this won't happen to their future clients. It's such a shame that a prestigious hotel could not do such a simple request. Up to this day, my money has not been refunded yet :-(",344
MBS,2,“Disappointing”,"A friend and I recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands solely for the purpose to check out and swim in the amazing infinity pool, which we had been looking forward to for months. Both of us were extremely disappointed with the service at the lobby, the quality of the rooms and the very ‘chaotic’ experience we had at the pool. Our first bad experience started at check in. Check in was at 3pm, which was fine for us, although didn’t leave much of the day to use the pool. As we weren’t able to use the pool that afternoon we asked whether it was possible that once we checked out at 12pm the next day, if we could use the pool that afternoon as we had a late flight out of Singapore (assuming this would not be an issue). The ‘abrupt’ staff member at the check in desk stated that you cannot use the pool as once you check out you will no longer have access to any of the hotels facilities. I have stayed at several hotels around the world, and have never heard anything as absurd as this. We were both extremely disappointed as we could only use the pool for a few hours in the morning, then had to rush off to vacate the hotel. As for the rooms, they were pretty basic and nothing amazing considering the cost of this hotel. The pool was incredible, although was packed with tourists so wasn’t very relaxing at all. Previous to staying at Marina Bay Sands, I had spent a week at the W Retreat and Spa in Bali where my expectations had been blown away with impeccable service and a high quality standard of facilities and decor throughout the resort. Considering both the hotels had similar ratings on Trip Advisor, I was shocked to see the huge discrepancy in both the quality of the hotel and the service provided. After my stay at Marina Bay Sands, I will definitely not be returning nor recommending it to friends or family travelling to Singapore.",81
MBS,2,“high cost for awful experience”,"Big hotel... expensive. Nice? Hell no.Its really not worth to paid a lot for stay in this hotel. From the check in procedure, not good experience. Alot people at the lobby and mostly those people not the hotel's guest, you will feel like in the train station.. crowded.Pool???? crap... i dont have to explain the detail about this. just imagine you share that pool with the outsider more than 100 people. you won't get relaxing feel .I won't return for sure",503
MBS,2,"“Great view, not so great service”","Recommend to get a room facing the city, with at least 20 floors (Would not want any of the nice view to be blocked by the shoppes opposite). It is stunning both in the day and at night. The other side faces the gardens by the bay, not as fancy at night in my opinion.You can get to see both sides nonetheless, at the famous infinity pool. We went once in the day and once at night. Water was not crystal clear though, perhaps because it was raining earlier in the day. Room itself was clean, bright, with a spacious bathroom with a gorgeous freestanding bathtub to soak in. Experience with the staff was not that friendly. Be sure to catch the skypark way before closing time to avoid getting shoved out. Since it was raining most of the day during our stay, we only managed to go to the sky park when the drizzle became lighter. However that was also close to the closing time of 11pm for the sky park. Several guests were rejected entry when they missed the closing time by a minute. I would have expected the hotel to be more understanding given the weather condition that day. Barely snapped a few photos at the Skypark before I was told that the skypark was closing, that I have no problem with. However when I called out to my friends a few steps away to leave together, the security guard called out to me in a harsh tone to stop me from walking towards them. I do not see why one should pay a premium price to be treated as treated with hostility. The wait for lifts are extremely long for the hotel, but the guards did not even let us enjoy the view while waiting for the lift. I understand that it is part of their job to ensure everyone clears the vacinity on time, but the staff do not seem to realise that they are in a service industry. Nothing impressed me about the service there, were not greeted by any staff around the hotel, also had to wait quite some time during check in. The minibar was filled to the brim. Could not make space for the macarons we bought since the minibar works on a weight sensor and we would be charged for the fluctuation in weight. On a positive note, the hotel has TWG tea and Robert Timms coffee in the room which was pleasant to enjoy in the morning. Overall I would recommend the hotel for a casual vacation stay with friends and family but not for honeymoon. The facilities, especially the infinity pool, are packed with people and it was hard to get a picture without someone else being in it. Nothing romantic about being in a crowded pool. May find better service elsewhere for the premium price tag. If you are not into the infinity pool, Swissotel with more than 70 floors is a good alternative for tall hotels with a view.",137
MBS,3,“Too big and crowded”,"I liked: transfer from airport on comfortable bus, champagne while waiting for check-in, room itself.I didn`t like: lot of people, huge amount of them, living in the hotel and just tourists, as the hotel is one of the sightseeing of the city, as a result - huge line for check-in...not the pleasant experience after long flight, though they offer free drinks and towels while standing. Pool on the roof - overcrowded and small, not clear about services provided at all - was the breakfast included or not, I still have no idea, and if it was - where it supposed to be. To tell the truth, I`d advice to stay on one of the smaller hotels opposite Marina Bay - in this case, you`ll have nicer view to this hotel. Looks nice, but to live there...not recommend.",200
MBS,2,“Big Disappointment”,"We stayed here the last night of our honeymoon and I was so disppointed. The service was ok, took three goes to get the right room (one of the rooms they gave us was still occupied!). Ended up downgrading us and didnt give me a refund on the difference in cost. And we ended up with a twin room as that was all they had - was really not how I was planning on ending our honeymoon! Was disappointed in room, was definitely not as fancy as I was expecting for the money we had paid. The bathroom was really nice however (until we couldnt work out how to turn off the speakers in the bathroom and left them on all night). Furniture was mismatched and balconies are tiny. The view from the infinity pool is amazing, but when we went up late afternoon (after checking in) it was so busy that we got in the pool and took a picture and then left. In my opinion you really stay at this hotel to say that you have (and to see the pool), because it really isn't worth it. I truely don't feel there is any value for money there.",455
MBS,2,“overpriced..just nice..”,"We are returning for our anniversary trip in Asia, we have stayed in different cities in mainly peninsula properties, after reading some reviews about this hotel and being mixed in opinions i decided to book with them, but i booked a suite with club entrance, and all the amenities jus to be safe...just as we rode when we entrance the hotel it looked super outside but once inside it felt like an enourmus train station, so crowded, we suppose to check in in the \vip lounge\"" not vip at all..crowded to, attention very cold and nothing special, the room i must admitt was amazing, really big and nice, and the bath wow, service to the room just ok, we had great problems trying to make outside local calls, operator had to transmit all my call, like in 1980, and they said they were to busy to go and check my phone, ..i had an accident with my leg just arriving to singapore in bangkok and i arrived in wheelchair, i must found some crutches, the concierges in the main tower 1 were rally cold , rude and they didnt want to help, not even call a near hospital , nothing, ..just a very nice and attent bell boy took me to the shopping mall below pharmacy to ask for crutches, only the concierge in the shopping mall called a hospital to ask for them, the one in the shopping mall!!!, i must admitt that the concierge in the tower 3, elevator entrance, did a wonderful job helping me to find a walking boot, he was very nice, but returning to the hotel, we tried the skypark, just to find it was crowded as a waterpark in florida, we had breakfast and afternoon entrance to the club but it was always crowded we ahd to make a line to go inside!!! we could spent only 15 mins inside!!!...and when we tried to use the pool (the main attraction in this hotel) we found the water wasnt heated!!! it was a hot day but in the afternoon and at that high it was windy and every body was cold wrapped in towels, just some russian, canadian and maybe some eskimos were swimming, !!! for a 800 usd per night hotel..not heated pool??? we could go inside!!...and there was an adult area in the pool but filled with children and families, no staff could keep that as an adult area...so, as i readed before this was cheap luxury, not luxury at all, is a strange mix and they try to make you fill luxury but is not, just stay somewhere elese and buy a day skypark entrance as all the 50,000 ouside people did every day...will not return.""",304
MBS,3,“5 star amenities with 1 star service”,"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing hotel complex, there's no argument there. The room we had (Premier with city view, Level 42) was very spacious, clean, comfortable bed, large bathroom, luxurious and had an amazing view. The infinity pool area that is probably one of the most photographed pools in the world is simply stunning. It's a large long pool which is not crowded and also has a no kids section, although sun beds can be difficult to get during peak afternoon times.The buffet breakfast was average for such a stunning hotel and the price they charge, similarly the cheese and chocolate bar also massively overprice, however the food to die for. Be sure to book for the buffet dinner or you'll miss out, only to be frustrated by observing all the empty tables that sit unused by people that have booked and presumably not turned up, yet they still turn walk-up hotel patrons away.The service overall was nothing but terrible! The staff are polite and friendly, but the service itself is terrible.Upon check-in we were informed that the room we had booked 3 months prior was not available and we could have a downgraded room if we liked, and that a booking only ensured we had a room, not a room type???After arguing for some 15 minutes, suddenly a room became available???? Very poor and not impressed.On two occasions during our 3 night stay we returned to our room at dinner time to shower and change for a night out, only to find our room being serviced. What a ridiculous time to be servicing a room when we had been out all day from very early on. Clearly they need more staff.Overall the hotel is fantastic and worth a visit, but it is massively overpriced and the service does not match the amenities.",644
MBS,3,"“5 star establishment, Not 5 star service”","We decided to stay here for the last 3 nights of our 2 & a half week honeymoon in Malaysia.While we eventually were satisfied, it came after a lot of running around and asking for management, which as the paying customer, you should not have to do.When we booked (through our travel agent) there was a deal going that if you booked and traveled in a certain period(we did), and you were certified honeymooners(we were) you would get a room upgrade from when you booked. So naturally we booked the premier room, as the next level was the club room.(I think it should be noted that other hotels we stayed at, Sheraton, Le Méridien, Shangri-La, all were booked with the foot note, Honeymoon. and all the three mentioned went out of their way to make it special, Rose petals and a bath run @ Le Méridien, Complentry bottle of wine on ice @ Sheraton, Small cakes, chocolates and a congratulations card @ Shangri-La.Upon check in at Marina Bay Sands we were told we had a premier room, to which i mentioned the upgrade, i was given a blank look and then after a while, told i would have to pay approx $650SD for the 3 nights. I asked to speak to someone else and they gave me the same response.I thought maybe it was a error from our agents side, so we took the room, contacted home and were told they would chase it up.we went out the all of the following day and while out we received a message from our agent saying they had contacted MBS and we would have our upgrade when we got back.When we returned, there was no note under the door, no message on the machine, i had to call the front desk and inquire about it and only after that, they sent someone to move our bags.The following morning we went up to the skypark to have breakfest in the Club, as we were entitled to it, we were told at the entrance that we had had our room upgraded, but had none of the privileges that came with it. (club breakfast, evening cocktails and snacks, ect)I went back down the the front desk, and this is where the stay gets better...The first nice person we encountered at the hotel was the front desk manager my the name of Gaylen Tan. I was all ready to lose it when i got down there, but when i explained the whole situation to Gaylen, he typed on the computer for a bit, then left the desk and escorted us all the way to the top and into The Club for breakfast, even asking the names of who had given us the run-around, as we shouldnt have to be doing that.This all came together on the last day, so at this point we only had the rest of the day/night and until check out the next morning.This last part of our stay though was wonderful, the part where we got to enjoy the benifits of the club room privilages, everyone was very inviting and helpful.The part i find disapointing is the way they treat people the are not in club rooms/suites. keep in mind this is still a 5 star and $500+AUD a night hotel.There is not much i can say about the pool that hasnt been said, if you think you are going to get it all to yourself, your are kidding, and as for check in, it wasnt an overly lengthy waiting time, what do you expect for a hotel with 2500 rooms.All in all it is a nice hotel and we can say we stayed there, but i would not do it again. there are plenty of other cheaper hotels where you will get a more personalised service, and not have to chase up things for yourself.",137
MBS,3,“over priced!”,"very large, almost shopping mall felling in reception area.Club Rooms are nice and clean and spacious. nice view of city from room but I think the bay views are equal as nice.views from pool are amazing .I think this is all the hotel really has that makes it worth it.A lot of staff I found to be quit rude and not friendly. I noticed staff at pool area talking amongst themselves and playing on mobile phone. also no smiles on there faces. One staff member also pushed in front of guest at lift to get in it before the guests.also I think wrist bands are a bit tacky have to get into the pool area.club lounge was great and the staff there were somewhat more professional. Food and breakfast was amazing .10 out of 10 for food.",477
MBS,1,“Everything you hate about Vegas transported to Singapore”,"If you like being treated with dismissive service, standing in long queues for service like check-in, concierge and taxi, and being treated with incredible rudeness at the casino, you will love Marina Bay Sands. Although the facility, particularly the pool on the top level, is stunning, you will never be made to feel as stupid as you do if you shell out upwards of $500/night only to be treated as though you're invisible.We paid for the club benefits (access to the pool, breakfast and cocktails in the club), and were asked to provide specific arrival details, with an email the day before our arrival directing us to the dedicated club check-in desk. When we arrived, that desk was closed (even though the email to me acknowledged when I said we would arrive and directed us to this desk), so we queued up behing about 30 people in the general check-in line. Half an hour later we finally got to the front desk, where we were dispatched with cursory service. Every employee we encountered, from the front desk to the concierge, to the waitstaff in the bars, was dismissive and curt. In particular, the check-in at the casino (passport verification) was a horrific experience. The guard, who spoke no English, detained me for 5 minutes while looking through my passport, looking at every stamp, paging endlessly through it. As I tried to ask him what he was looking for, he refused to answer (I guess because he didn't speak English), so I just took my passport back and left. The sales staff at the two MBS gift shops on the lobby level acted as though our transactions were the ultimate bother.The cleaning staff left a dirty cleaning rag on our bed.The bars are too small, too noisy, and waaaaaaaaay too expensive. Expect to pay about 3x the price of drinks at nearby joints.The cocktails at the lounge on the top featured only a couple of wines, one sparkling wine, and limited well liquors with a mixer. No blended drinks, margaritas, mojitos.It's hard to fathom how this culture of dismissive service is able to permeate the entire structure, unless the staff is specifically trained to be demeaning, insulting and curt. I suppose it is the Vegas culture, rewarding casino high-rollers, and treating everyone else as useless.My advice: the facility is worth seeing, particularly the pool, but you can buy a day pass to the pool for a few dollars. Stay elsewhere (all my prior stays in Singapore have been fantastic -- Raffles, Pan Pacific and other local hotels) and experience the service Singapore is known for.Don't miss the light show at 8 pm or 9:30 pm. Sit on the steps outside the shops facing the Esplanade. You don't need to be a hotel guest to catch this light show. Stay elsewhere and be on the steps for the show.",368
MBS,1,“Disgraceful service.”,"I would strongly suggest that you look at other hotels for your stay in Singapore. We requested non-smoking, double bed in our booking. Upon checking in, we were told that they ran out of non-smoking double bed rooms and will put us in a twin room (on the 3rd floor) and the housekeeping will come and combine the beds and put a duvet / mattress cover over. The front desk typed all that into the system. Waited almost 30min and housekeeping came, he was clueless why he was sent there. Could only speak mandarin (my understanding is that MOM has stipulated that ALL front service staff need to be able to speak English?), told us firmly that they don't have a practice of putting a duvet over, so he will just push the two beds together. We told him to please check with front desk. He told us to call the front desk to check ourselves. We insisted that he check, he said he will check and get back to us and just promptly walked out!! Oh, he had a fancy device to tell him why he was sent to our room but didn't/couldn't read it?So we call the service desk from our room, was told they will check and get back to us in 5min. No one got back to us after 7min, so we called again. Was told that they will check (again!) and get back to us in 15min. We had enough of this nonsense, went down to the front desk to sort things out. Spoke to one of the guys in a suit standing around, and lady (manager?) came by and told him that it was sorted out. He check the system and magically they have a double bed, non smoking on the 49th floor.MBS, you got to buck up your level of service. As a Singaporean, I'm embarrassed that level of service is offered at a 5-star hotel in Singapore. I have stayed in many hotels for staycation in Singapore and this is the absolute rock bottom. It don't matter if you have a huge pool with a great view. When you treat your paying customers as idiots, they aren't going to return.",624
MBS,1,“The absolute worst excuse for a luxury hotel...the truest of rip-offs”,"This property is a joke in the high end luxury market...i have never wish to encourage fellow travelers to avoid a property as I do with this one. Arrival was initiated by someone (bellman?) who did not welcome me....grabbed my bags, did not confirm that all my nags had been retrieved and then waved for me to follow him...only we stopped half way in the drive for him to take my information so that bag could be delivered later. Check-in was the most miserable experience of any property, luxury or otherwise, that I have experienced in all my travels. No less than 10-12 people in line while i was watching. The 30 minute wait in a queue was then met with a 20 minute check-in process that seemed nonsensical. The formal greeting at check-in begins with \sorry for the delay in serving you\""....could not believe i was hearing that with every customer. They subsequently attempted to down sell a view of the ocean instead of my city view...which then resulted in a 2 hour delay (along with many other customers) Now i am curious as to why they ask for an arrival time if they make no attempt to have a room ready (i arrived 2 hours after their check-out time) They then suggested that i come back in an hour to check on my room and then another 40 minutes after that. No where in the check-in area is there a queue for people attempting to check on their room status. So unless you pull aside a \""suit\"" that's standing around trying to look professional, they expect you to get back in the queue. The seating area in the lobby for all those customers waiting on a room is COMPLETELY INADEQUATE. There was some sort of childrens balloon entertainer who was not even in uniform and looked as if he could have come off the street trying to pick up tips. After finally getting a room. I went up to the pool which was inundated with children everywhere. There was either no adult area for some peace of mind or it was not being enforced whatsoever...so the relaxing photos they show of adults taking in the view of the city are largely exaggerated. Seating at the pool was miserably anemic...i gave up after 2 sweeps. Upon returning to my room for the evening i found stains on my sheets and the duvet cover...photos below. Fortunately I had decided to only spend 2 days there. The following day I went to RISE for lunch and noticed that their staff are not even trained well enough to label their cheeses correctly...now some might say this is minor, but THIS IS A $500/NIGHT PROPERTY and they DO NOT HAVE A CLUE as to how to present themselves as one. Where are the trained epicurean professionals you would expect at a property of this price point? I had to go to the reception desk to ask for my bill to be generated as the server had disappeared. At check-out I attempted to use their express check-out...went through all the steps only for the monitor to tell me it could not process my monitor. So went to the desk explained the situation and then got a blind stare as to what she should do...i suggested they print me a receipt so that i could leave and never come back. The icing on the cake....there was no doorman and the doors are not automatic. PEOPLE PLEASE SKIP THIS PROPERTY. If your desire is to see the pool go up for a drink at either of the restaurants at either side and take your $500/night and live it up at a property that understands what being a luxury hotels involves.""",368
MBS,3,“First stay great second... terrible?”,"I have stayed twice at Marina Bay, the first time in May 2013 and it was great, the service the room was excellent. We had a club room which is worth it if you are going to use the facilities, afternoon tea on the roof.... too many macaroons to choose from plus fresh berries and other delicious treats, then cocktails and canapes from 5pm. Our room was facing Singapore city and we had a great view of the laser show at night........ The second time I stayed there was a whole lot different.. I booked a club suite thinking I would have a similar room as I did the first time? Well from the moment we arrived, and add we flew from Zurich so we were tired and wanted to get to our room. We were sent to the VIP area to check in.... here we waited 40min in the line then were told our room was a king and fold out bed, keeping in mind this room is $700p/n and I said we wanted 2x queens (there were 3 of us) none of us wanted a sofa bed. From here they took us to a room at the back of the hotel on a lower floor no view and a sofa bed, we said we were not happy with this room and were told there were no front rooms available,,, I asked to see the manager she came was not nice at all although we did end up with a front room.... this took well over 1.5 hours, so we missed the afternoon tea and cocktail hours. I asked if we could have this the following day as we had a late flight,,, and were told no thats bad luck you missed it today, then again we were in disagreement regarding our room and what came with it! like afternoon tea and cocktail hour,,, again eventually we did get afternoon tea. For a hotel of this stature and price I would think they would have gone out of their way to accommodate us without constant disagreements which was time consuming and unnecessary. I don't think I would stay there again, the second stay has tainted our view.",59
MBS,3,“Beautiful Hotel with Average Service”,"Hotel itself is very beautiful, but the room we stayed in was so tiny and 'normal' for the price we paid!! :( Service was OK but not too impressive. The infinity pool & jacuzzis at the rooftop were amazing. I think most money we paid for the hotel goes here. Casino downstairs was luxurious and beautiful! Very Expensive though!!",300
MBS,3,“Worst staff experienced worldwide.”,"Best product 10 out of 10. Worst service. Let's start with reservations/operator. It became laughable to us just to get through the experience. 20-30 minute wait times to call hotel and for anyone to pick up the phone. Even morning/afternoon time. Several times hung up after waiting 30 minutes and paying enormous long distance phone calls. Customer service at front desk, reception: Pathetic. They are trying to please you when you ask for anything so much to the point they never LISTEN to you. They are very good at saying \I'm sorry\"" but can not resolve anything. No proactive staff or listening skills. We though we were in a comedy movie. Customer service was better in a college dorm back in the day. Yes it is truly this bad. You have to experience it for yourself just to believe me. Security: my iPhone was stolen from the pool area up top. Due to the clientele I'm pretty sure it was a kid or staff that stole the phone. I tried to place a police report and they didn't know how to help me even do this! I could see the complete lack of proactive service would take an entire day so we gave up. Even trying to request a statement for my insurance claim on my iPhone was not possible for them including the manager. Valet: the staff couldn't even get my 2 suitcases in the boot so I had to do it for them! You have to stay here for the pool experience but let go of ALL customer service expectations and rely on them for absolutely nothing so you will still have a great time. We learned at this hotel you ask no one a question. We stopped asking after about 20 different questions and started using google.""",242
MBS,3,“Very Average.Just another Sands money making machine!”,"Stayed there for 2 nights on 29th and 30th October in Grand Club Room with City View. The room was average for a 5 star hotel. Nothing special to mke it stand out and there is far better on offer in Singapore for the same or less. The Club room gives you access to the club lounge on the sky deck for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. I found the club to be ok but very busy, the staff seemed rushed off their feet and you are not allowed to pour your own drinks in the evening, so it took a bit of time to get served during the peak times. All in all not one of the best hotel clubs I have been to apart from the view.Yes the pool is cool to look at the view from but be warned it is very very busy so if you are hoping for a relaxing chill out in the pool forget it, it is crowded for dawn till dusk. My wife and I wanted to go in but just could not be bothered fighting the crowds.The bars and restaurants are overpriced given the quality and service, even by Singapore standards and don't bother going to the Ku De Ta Club, it is small with zero atmosphere and ridiculously high drink prices. All in all, nothing special, average service and just another Sands money making machine. I will not stay there again.",52
MBS,3,“Greatly hyped hotel”,"I stayed at this hotel during 6-8 Nov'13 on a business trip.

I began to explain to the lady that we were guaranteed early check in and she began to be very rude and speak in Singaporean to a fellow work colleague both being very rude, laughing and being unprofessional.I took this quit offensive and asked them to speak in English after waiting we still were not guaranteed our early check in and asked to leave our luggage with front desk and come back around 12 to see if the room was ready, I was extremely upset and not to mention tired, i was disappointed in the customer service.

MBS,2,“Exorbitant and Too Big.”,"This property is huge, too big for its own good. The rooms are average, some floors smell like smoke and the club level is pathetic. We decided to pay more for a \club level\"" room, over $600 per night, I'll get to that in a minute. The club level felt like a mediocre Vegas buffet, the choice of food was ridiculous and the service was very poor. The one good thing about this hotel is that it is attached to a great shopping mall that has everything you could ever want, including Osteria Mozza, one of my favourite restaurants in LA. We checked out after the first night. Although I don't gamble, I get that it's a hotel with a casino and therefore it charges a lot, but please….over $600 per night!…daylight robbery.""",338
MBS,2,“Bitterly Disapointed”,"We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Marina Bay Sands, staying in the Premiere room. We were shocked upon arrival at the sheer amount of people everywhere, and the continuous lining up and queuing for services and the overcrowded pool area.Bad points-Line to check in (we arrived before 3pm, so had to return to get room key, where there was another line to pick up room key)-Line to get into pool area whilst they check everyone's passes-Line to check out-We attempted to go to breakfast one of the mornings, but saw the line to walk in, and the line at the buffet so turned around to ordered in room serviceBut the most disappointing part was the pool area was nothing, and I can't stress this enough, nothing as shown in their marketing material. There are people and children everywhere. Out of the 4 times we ventured up there, we were only able top get a lounge chair twice. With the literally thousands of rooms available in this hotel, the sky deck can just not cope with that amount of people, the pool is just packed.We tried to get a drink in the late afternoon at the Ku Da Te restaurant, but there was nowhere to sit outside, so we went to the bar, again there was nowhere to sit down and relax. We spent close to $50 on one of the cheapest glasses of wine and beer available, and were forced to share a standing table next to a smoking couple.The hotel is just not what is represented on the website and just not worth the huge expense to be herded around like cattle.We would have shared our comments with management if we could have faced another queue at front desk, or if they had asked our thoughts at check out, but I'm guessing there queues are so long that there's no timeGood PointsThe view from the pool is quite lovely The rooms are very spaciousThe staff are quite well trained and always smiling",255
MBS,3,"“Great pool, the rest is average”","We were so excited to stay at this hotel! The architecture is just stunning and how cool to swim in the rooftop pool!!However those were the only two things that kept us excited throughout our stay there. The whole time we were there we just felt like the customer service was lacking that special something. We just felt like we were one of the other thousands of people there, a bit like a Las Vegas hotel feeling. The rooms were nice, nothing to complain about there. The lobby was completely underwhelming, not much in it but a huge cafe that was overpriced. So that pretty much meant that there was no where for us to lounge in the lobby. Honestly, it was so boring that we didn't even explore it so I have not idea what is past the cafe...maybe a shop? don't know. The Marina Bay Sands mall is great, and you can get to the mall from the lobby if you are already in the hotel. The biggest and best things about this hotel was the skypark, rooftop pool and hot tubs!! Swimming in the pool, enjoying the view and taking pictures of us in the pool was such a cool experience. Basically it was a once in a lifetime experience and totally worth the so so service and slightly overpriced hotel. I would recommend anyone who travels to Singapore stay in this hotel for one night so that you can experience the pool, then switch hotels to something more centrally located/less expensive.",113
MBS,3,“Stunning infinity pool. Too crowded -”,"It is an absolutely No.1 stunning rooftop shared-pool around the world. Tell everyone.! Tourists will stay for the pool, not the room to be exact. However, it will no longer be an infinity pool for an overpriced stay. More like a public swimming pool where everyone pays $1 entrance fee to swim and play at a nearby neighbourhood swimming complex. Not sure if guests are allowed to bring inflatable mattress and pool equipment for a fun time. But if they do, I think it will not be fair for others. It might get too squeezy in the water.! Get a private pool or some places worth the value and stay on your vacation.",298
MBS,3,“You're paying for the pool.....”,"We stayed here for 2 nights - 18/19 th October 2013. It's not up to the same standard of similar 5 star places I have stayed that's for sure. The room decor ( we stayed in room 3711) was lovely, electric curtains, huge bathroom and satisfactory toiletries. The room itself wasn't spotless, the bathroom floor had balls of hair in the corners ( gross) and there were 2 Hershey's kisses under the desk and as much as I love them, they definitely weren't mine. This is a sign of little or no vacuuming. I agree with other reviews that the foyer does resemble a train station and whilst it has nice art pieces, it's very cold and sterile. I was terribly sunburnt from a day at Adventure Cove water park ( yes I know my bad) so decided to keep my tshirt on in the pool the next day. I was reprimanded by the pool guard within 2 minutes as it doesn't meet dress code which was very embarrassing . Nowhere at the pool, nor in the manual in our room does it say that and I had to ring the concierge to confirm this. So it's ok for women to wear g string bikinis and a couple to have simulated sex in the pool ( many other guests were commenting on that) with no repercussions , but my plain grey tshirt was offensive! Also on the website and in the room manual there is mention of an airport shuttle and a hospitality room for guests to refresh before check in but upon asking, these options are no longer available. So, in summary, you pay to stay here for the amazing views and the pool ( which has a kid freezone which we loved) and that's about it.",199
MBS,3,“Too extravagant for a stay.”,"Based on reviews in Tripadvisor, queuing for check in is hell. Thus, we decided to leave Ibis around 3pm (check in time is at 3pm, check out is at 11am). Upon arrival, it took me almost 30minutes before checking in. We got a Club Room with City View at Tower 2 (43rd floor). This room costs 800SGD++ per night, which includes complimentary breakfast for two, afternoon tea (with cake buffet), and non-alcoholic beverages for dinner at SkyPark. Amenities wise, this hotel is pretty expensive. The size and features of the room is much similar with the Deluxe Harbour View Room of the Royal Pacific at Canton street in HK (Royal Pacific might even be better), which costs only around 7kphp per night. The Club room is vast with a really nice view of the Merlion Park, Helix, Esplanade Mall and Fullerton Hotel. It has a bath tub with complete toilet amenities. Safety box and refrigerator are also available. There’s also a Nespresso machine with free 6 espresso shots. You could also use an iron for crumpled shirts and tops. For those wondering if it’s worth the splurge I would probably say yes, it is, but for one time only.",449
MBS,2,“Don't be fooled by the looks. This Hotel is RUBBISH!!”,"We stayed from the 12th to 18th October, We booked a suite for our first 2 nights and a premier room for the remaining 4 nights. We received an e-mail from the hotel prior to our arrival advising us to proceed to the VIP lounge for check-in upon arrival. The VIP lounge was very crowded and we were advised by one of the staff to go to the main Registration desk to complete the check-in formalities, this took one hour and what a shambles. The suite room on the 21st floor was dirtly with dust everywhere and liquid stains on the coffee table etc. The floor carpet felt grubby. The suite itself lacked ambiance and character. There was no complimentary tea or coffee available within the suite room, however it did have an Expressor maker and accessories. The twin beds in the premier room were actually two single beds and again this room was not the cleanest. There was a good balcony to view from and relax but there was no furniture provided for the balcony. The breakfast on the 57th floor was very poor quality and had a minimal selection, is is not worth the money, tea was served from Thermos jug kettles, this is not what one would expect from a so called 5 star hotel. \This place makes McDonalds look good for breakfast\"", The Infinity pool is good however do not expect to be able to swim in it during the day or evenings as it is full of people taking photos and admiring the view. It is difficult to find a lounger / chair to use. We were a family of three and we had to share one lounger between us, definately not worth the prices. The lobby of the hotel is equivelant to a train station or an airport terminal. There is no whow factor or ambiance in the place to make it feel like one is inside a so called 5 star hotel. The food outlets on the ground floor are overpriced and do not provide value for money. It was even hard to get a hot cup of coffee or tea from one of these outlets. The presentation was nice, but quality and quantity was not to be found. The only things which sells this hotel is the curosity factor, the infinity pool, Casino, Shopping Outlets, I have been a frequent visitor to Singapore for the past 20 years, there are a whole lot more quality 5 star hotels available in Singapore for the same money or less which provide cleanliness, ambiance and character for a much more enjoyable and memorable stay. The check out time was as dreadful as the Check-in.""",230
MBS,3,"“Roof-top pool, casino... Thats all”","With all recommendations of my friends I chose this hotel for my one night stay in Singapore. First of all, the architecture is great inside and outside. A huge lobby. Its a bad copy of Vegas hotels. The building is great and huge but it lacks the Vegas atmosphere.The roof top pool is really amazing. Its so crowded so I chose not to swim but the bar and club is a unique experience.The casino is distant from the lobby, its more Asian style than Vegas. The drink service to the tables sucks but dealers are generally fine. Generally nice casino.Other than these I didnt enjoy the hotel at all. My rooms was in tower3 which took 5 minutes to walk from the main entrance. My room was facing the backside highway at 6th floor. The room was extremely noisy. I could even move to another hotel if I had one more night to stay. It can be acceptable for a 3* hotel but for such a hotel with such a high room rate thats really not acceptable. The rooms is very spacious but lacks a unique decoration. Its like standard rooms of Vegas. Generally I didnt enjoy my stay. It can be a choice for first time in Singapore but for the next visits I would never ever stay there, but come back for the casino and the roof bar.",66
MBS,3,“Staycation at Marina Bay Sands”,"Totally captivated by the scenary @ Sands Skypark.It is really a lovely sight to enjoy the night breeze at level 57. The room was big given the price we paid.However, there is still room for improvement to create an welcoming overall customer experience.It was a 5 star hotel but i definitely do not feel the homely factor.It is lacking the Wow factor that truly impresses me.",202
MBS,3,“Amazing pool but....”,"That's about the only reason to stay here. The infinity pool really is spectacular with a magnificent 360 degree view of the Singapore skyline and harbour, and equally a cocktail at ku de ta or the rooftop lounge is amazing but the problem with the whole set up is the scale. There are hundreds of people in the pool, hundred in the lobby, long queues at check in, queues at the lifts, waiting 15mins to get your entry key card checked when it wouldn't work in the lift, queues to collect your luggage etc and full of large tour groups. It feels more like a theme park than a five star hotel. The rooms are average (decor/facilities) compared to some of the beautiful accomodation on offer in other parts of the city and the staff while all very professional seem rushed and overwhelmed (back to the scale issue) so it is not a relaxing nor a personalised experience. I'd say this is a great place for the party set that want to mix it hundreds of others in an environment that has a buzz but for the more discerning traveller there are many better options in Singapore. I wouldn't stay here again.",187
MBS,1,“Crap”,"To all the travelers to Singapore. Don't waste your money to stay in this hotel. The building is awesome. The lobby is like a central train station, children running around with their scooter, we stayed at the suit room with one bed. We're advised to proceed to VIP lounge upon arrival. At VIP lounge we're ask to go to registration 15 people ahead of us. Disgusting arrival. We book our holiday 2 mos. ago before, skypark breakfast is tasteless bacon are charred Danish bread/ pastries like leather, the skypark chef has to go back to culinary school to learn how to cook bacon. The so called infinity pool is like water park, crowded, full of guest visitors. I've been in the best hotel in the world, this hotel is the worst to bad we book for 6 nights of agony. The service is the worst, we go down to premier to have to beds for my child book for city view, but they give us the sea view coz no room for city view only garden view it's disgusting. I love Singapore but not this hotel. I",93
MBS,3,“Leisure”,"I was very upset and regret in staying to this hotel.I booked a deluxe room. the check in was fast and the room was ready by 12pm. noon.But they put me at Lower level room , almost like street level view.really upset, since we spend 24 hour for our fly.We are NOT enjoy our vacation.I am NOT going to recomand some one to stay here. I should believe some one before. service is not as good as people say. The only one for people gambler are happy. Not for us for enjoy Vacation.",282
MBS,3,“In a word: Disappointing!”,"After reading a number mixed of reviews my wife and I decided to risk and book the Marina Bay as the first part of our honeymoon. The hotel is massive and architecturally is spectacular, with the view from the pool area/sky deck being superb. However these good points are also its negatives, as big as the hotel is it always seemed crowded and stressful and I think was due to large groups of tourists that wandered around the reception areas. The pool area looks a good size but reality it just cannot accommodate the amount of people that want to be up there, my wife and I managed to a couple of sun loungers on the third day of being there and this was on a Sunday afternoon as a lot of people seemed to have checked out and the hotel did quieten down a little for an hour or so. I'm not a prude when it comes to big hotels as I have stayed in Vegas and this reminds me of a Vegas style hotel, but in Vegas it works here it just seemed busy and hectic all the time and lacked that personal touch.On the flip side of this the decor of the hotel is very nice and this continues into the hotel rooms which are of a good size and they were also very clean and well equipped we had no complaints here.To summarise, If I knew anyone coming to Singapore I would suggest staying elsewhere and paying the 20 dollars or so to visit the Sky Park as the view is definitely worth it, but for the price you pay I feel there are better alternatives in Singapore.",186
MBS,3,"“Ok, a must see and stay but service is terrible.”","2 night stay at the marina bay sands and we had booked 5 rooms. The rooms are nice, but certainly a little \ sparse\"" in decor, but quiet and amazing views. However, you are really just a number. The service on level 57 across the pool bar restaurant, bars, nightclub and restaurant Is so mediocre and considering the prices they charge most certainly not up to scratch. $9sd for a bottle of water! No one came up to us by the pool to offer drinks, (and it wasn't busy) you had to have a \""pass\"" so tacky! Surely you could swipe your key or something? I'm glad I ave stayed there and I think it's somewhere you old want to experience for maybe one night, but given the prices and the service that's provided, no, I wouldn't stay again. Even check in is slack. The guy handed me my key and didn't even let me know where to go or what floor and promptly disappeared! Oh and the spa was so hot you couldn't sit in it more than 5 mins or you may have cooked!""",217
MBS,3,"“Hotel was just OK, Restaurant was horrendous”","As per everyone else's reviews, check in is definitely not one of this hotels strong points.We flew in late, so missed the long queues however it still took a good 30mins to check in. Very strange.Our room was very large, we had a club room. It seemed a bit bare though.The views were great.The roof pool looks amazing- the adults area is a lot more relaxing (we were getting attacked in the normal pool by kids doing dive bombs every couple of mins!). The water is a bit disgusting but its one of those things that you just have to do.The worst part of our stay was our restaurant experience at Sky 57. The staff were BEYOND rude. We asked if we could have a table near the window- it was like hell would freeze over before that happened.There's no point whatsoever in going there if you dont have a table next to the window- you might as well be anywhere paying a lot less for better food (and service!)Our friend was extrememly disappointed because she had booked the restaurant for a celebration. The aircon is SO cold in there that they offer diners (women only) pashminas. A fine dining restaurant offering out old, ugly pashmians? Really?!Definitely dont recommend the restaurant and the hotel is just OK",85
MBS,3,“Great View and Pool not more.”,"The pool is great, especially the view. Also form the rooms you get a great view of Singapore. Ohterwise we where rather disapointed with the hotel. It has over 2500 rooms, which makes the lobby more like a airport terminal then a hotel. The room was very small but clean and the view was fantastic.Given the amount of guest the service was rather poor and it took rather long for the luggage to arrive at the room. The concierge was very friendly and helpful though.",80
MBS,3,“Beware of highway view rooms”,"Be careful if you book a room in this massive hotel. You may be unfortunate like me to be given a low floor room facing a highway. The noise is incessant, through the night. While I understand that there are good and bad rooms in every hotel, the hotel should have a special category of rates for this type of rooms. They could call it highway view rooms and charge the rates according. The pool while spectacular is a circus...",161
MBS,3,“Too large and too rigid”,"Don't get me wrong; the Marina Bay Sands is a world class hotel. Compared to other hotels at this level it is however a disappointment. It is simply too large. The queues are too long, it is too far too walk to your room, there are too many elevators, too many people in the roof pool, etc. Upon our arrival I wanted to have a look at the roof facilities. Having made my way up through two elevators I was rejected because I - having brought only my room card - had forgot my separate coupons for access to the gym and pool. It took me 10 minutes of elevator travling to go get this and come back up. This is how rigid this feels. The size of the hotel and the rules imposed make it impossible for the Marina Bay Sands to give you the same feeling as for example the Fullerton Bay. The latter is our recommendation in Singapore!",108
MBS,3,"“Reality&show is 5 star,but service is not more than 3 star...”","That's the most important building to visit in Singapore,so more or less every traveller is there during day and night,thus there is always a big crowd inside the hotel and staff is having bad time to assist the hotel customers lining up for check in and out procedures.Lobby are like a metro station,always too crowded with incoming travellers to visit the hotel.To eat somewhere at the hotel is also very difficult if you are lucky enough to get a table and more important to find a waiter who is really eager to make service to you,if you can have an eye contact with him&her to have their attention.",277
MBS,1,“5 Star Ego But 3 Star Service”,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel may look \Iconic\"" architecturally but as always, looks can be deceiving and the hotel experience that hotel management offer business travellers especially is far below any normal acceptable \""business\"" standard. The hotel itself is vast which is why the main lobby feels more like a cross between Grand Central Station and a Chinese version of the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul than the discreet, welcoming and friendly lobby hard travelling executives prefer at the end of a long flight. On a recent business trip I stayed in a wide range of hotels in about 20 different cities, many of them considerably less sophisticated than Singapore. Marina Bay Sands Hotel was by far the worst experience of all the hotel we stayed in, including places like Algeria, and they were the ONLY hotel who felt the need to offer me a free voucher for a return visit because of major failures by management in room service, house keeping and customer relations. I have stayed in the hotel twice now as a business guest and on both occasions I came to the conclusion that there were major flaws in the hotel design, layout and operation and that senior management seriously neglected in their duties towards their guests. My honest advice to those travellers wishing to visit Singapore - find a hotel close to the Marina Bay Sands which is better managed and far more professional and then simply ask for a room with a view of the \""iconic\"" Marina Bay Sands, especially at sunset. This way you have all the advantages of the view and none of the serious disadvantages of having to stay there.""",276
MBS,3,“Big definitely isn't better”,"We stayed here 2 years ago and wrote a review titled 'Big isn't necessarily better, as I thought maybe my impression at the time was jaundiced having just had a week in the Maldives. So based on reviews in Trip Advisor and others, we decided to give it another go.I was right the first time.The place is, despite being architecturally amazing, a barn. The massive foyer is as long and busier than Changi Airport departures hall, but noisier due to the tiled floors and soaring atrium. We booked 6 months prior to arrival, yet our requested room wasn't available. Instead they shoved two twin beds together, meaning one side didn't have a headboard so pillows kept falling down the back with all the cabling. The bathroom had a lingering odour of vomit which seemed to come from the drains and the air on was noisy.Breakfast in Rise restaurant is a bit like the Serengeti, with great herds of people catching and killing their own from the huge buffet. With so many people from different cultures all feeding from the same trough, there were some inevitable differences in manners. The staff were very efficient, managing to clear our table twice while we were out on the plain hunting orange juice and omelet. This was blamed on the casual staff.The pool is stunning, day or night, but with sooo many people all swimming in the same waterhole, it felt like bathing in a Petrie dish.This review seems very negative but I do so to draw attention to the gap between what MBS claims to be and what it delivers and I hope it is taken in that light.",711
MBS,3,"“Save your money and stay elsewhere, but stop by for a look.”","Extremely disappointing.My wife and I arrived at the hotel around 11PM, after having notified the hotel of our late arrival two weeks in advance and getting an email confirmation that our room would be held for us. Lo and behold, our room type was not available and the check-in staff tried to downgrade us to a lower level room (smaller bathroom, no bathtub) and have us change our room on the following day when the originally booked room became available. I explained that changing rooms when we're only staying two nights was highly disruptive, that I had email confirmation in hand that the room would be available, and that we had been travelling for the last 10 days and were eager to get into our room to finally get some rest. They had no interest in honoring the 'Deluxe Room' which we had booked, and it was up to me to suggest that they upgrade us, rather than downgrade us. After almost 10 minutes dialing numbers and waiting on hold, the staff finally said we could stay in a 'Club Room' which I understood to be a 'Deluxe Room' on a higher floor. Finally, satisfaction! But why did it take so long to do the right thing? And, what about that 'Club Room' anyway?Well, the Club Room had issues. Disgusting mold spots on the walls and the ceiling was covered in mold, which looks to have been painted over. I noticed this the next day, but it we had already 'given up' with this hotel. The air conditioner was not working properly at all. It read 22C, which was pretty cold for us, so I set it to 25C, but the temperature never changed. Finally I turned it off in the middle of the night and the temperature still didn't rise, despite being a balmy 29C outside. I tried setting it to 28C, the highest setting available, but the temperature was still too low at 23C. Finally I just opened the balcony door a bit to let in warm air, which also shuts off the AC. If everyone has been doing that, it might explain the mold...I also had a rash and terrible itching after laying in the bed for an hour. I wonder if there were bed bugs or other nasties in the sheets. This hasn't happened to me before.My last complaint regarding the room was the thin walls. I could hear the neighbors talking and watching TV. As for the rest of the hotel, I was miffed at being turned away from the Ku de Tat bar on the roof deck, at 8pm when the place was empty. The reason? I was wearing flip flops. Nice leather 'flip flops' along with a $120 shirt and $90 jeans and a five figure watch. Of course, any woman with sandals, flops or exposed toes can get in, but a man can't. I don't quite understand this requirement, and it makes me extremely angry considering the rest of my attire, my lovely wife and here dress / rings / earrings etc., and the fact that I'm paying $700 a night to stay there. Ugh!!!But it didn't end there. The $250 a plate restaurant also rejected me for having flip flops on. Same deal as with the bar... But they were happy to suggest I wear my running shoes instead. What a shame. The attitude is not necessary. The dress code is overly stringent. And to make matters worse, the food wasn't even that good. But that's for another review.All in all, the service and treatment was extremely disheartening. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the infinity pool on the roof. It IS amazing. But once you take a few pictures of it and have seen it with your own eyes, there's not much left. You can swim, sure, as we did. But after 10 minutes we felt it was too cold and it's easy to get bored with the view. Just take a free visit, possible night and day, snap a picture, and be on your way. Don't shell out hundreds of dollars per night for a room here. See it, yes. Shop, play, drink, yes! But safe yourself a hassle, save yourself a disappointment, and stay elsewhere.",118
MBS,3,“A place that you have to stay once”,"We spent a week at the Marina Bay sands in the club rooms. The hotel is very impressive and the view from the pool of Singapore is fantastic. Now the down side. As the hotel is so huge it has no personal feel to it you are just a room number, plus as we were in the club rooms for when we tried to get into the restaurant one night they wanted to charge us an extra $48 per person! That I thought was wrong as we were paying over $500 per night for the rooms. Plus the service at the pool took too long and it took an age to find someone to actually ask for something.",131
MBS,1,“Major dissapointment”,"Simply one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. Our non-smoking rooms smelled like smoke, and the staff made no effort at all to find another room for us. They said they had no other room available, and I had to insist for hours until they accepted my request of changing my reservation to a lower category, just so that I could have a non-smelly room. Front Desk staff was extremely unfriendly, as well as many staff in other departments. I have not seen one single employee who seemed happy about working there.The view is overrated, and so is the swimming pool, which is always full and impossible to find a chair to lay down.Marina Bay Sands is overpromising what they can offer. Please do not make your reservation there.",128
MBS,3,“Worth a night there for the pool but that's all”,"The MBS demonstrates beautifully that, with regard to hotels, bigger rarely means better. My experience there started badly with a slow check in and a wait of nearly one hour for my bags to be delivered after they were sent to the wrong room. Apologies were made but the damage was done! The room lacked some basics I would expect in a modern 5 star hotel - no iPod docking station, no magnifying mirrored in the bathroom - and the bathroom lighting was poorly thought through. The rooftop pool is certainly fun but unless you go at 6am you can forget actually swimming in it - it is too crowded with people taking photos of themselves... I will not be returning - the Mandarin Oriental is much better.",742
MBS,2,“Far from the best hotel in Singapore”,"I have been coming to Singapore regularly on business for more than 25 years. I have stayed in a lot of different hotels in the city and it have some lovely places. This is not one of them - unless you have a compelling reason to be at this hotel specifically (e.g. a conference at the Conference Centre and you want to be on the doorstep, or you like the casino) then I'd recommend you think twice before booking Marina Bay Sands.When I arrived my luggage was plucked from the taxi and before it disappeared, I specifically asked the Bell Captain how long it would take to deliver to my room, since I had a meeting and was quite tight for time following a flight delay. He assured me the bag would be delivered very quickly so I left it with him while I went to check in.Now, to me one of the measures of a good hotel is the ambiance on arrival. At MBS it's awful - it's like walking into a very busy shopping mall - there were literally thousands of people milling about, checking in/out, taking photos of the massive atrium etc etc. There was also a 15 minute line to check in -- I was liking this hotel less and less.When I eventually reached the front of the line for check-in I was told my room type (double non-smoking) was not available. I was offered either non-smoking twin or smoking double. Neither of which I wanted. I was told that non-smoking was a 'request' option and they really were not at all apologetic. I told them I'd take a non-smoking twin and requested to be moved as soon as possible to a double room. By this time I'd probably been in the hotel 30 minutes and only just got a room key.When I got to my room, what I _didn't_ find was my suitcase. I called down and was told it was on its way. It eventually arrived more than 45mins and two more phone calls after I'd arrived in the hotel, by which time I was almost going to be late for my meeting. Obviously I couldn't go in the shower while I was waiting for my bag in case the bag arrived, so it was very frustrating. While I was waiting I called the manager to complain about the missing bag and the wrong room type and was told he would look into it - eventually I was offered a non-smoking double room on another floor and someone to help me move my stuff. Why I had to make a fuss for this to happen, rather than being offered this room in the first place, I have no idea. The hotel's appearance is very grand - from a distance the three towers with the 57th floor observation deck & pool look very impressive. Likewise the ground-floor atrium. The rooms are OK but nothing particularly special - the desk is laid out well, with power & ethernet right where you want them, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and the towels were soft & fluffy. There was also plenty of wardrobe space. But there are some odd details, too - for example, in the conferencing area, the veneer panels are in fact fake - wallpaper and in place it's pealing so it's very obvious. The elevators don't seem to have consistent aircon which is surprising in a country where the temperature is typically 30 degrees Centigrade. The on the 57th floor, the rest-rooms didn't smell at all nice - not very appetizing when the restaurant up there looks extremely swanky.Although the only dining I did in the hotel was as part of the conference, the food seemed good. However I have been told my friends that have dined in the hotel's restaurants that they are extremely expensive. Since Marina Bay is some way from 'proper' Singapore (10min walk even to Mandarin Oriental, a taxi or MRT journey to Orchard Road), you're a little captive if you are staying here. One friend told me they paid US$10 per piece for sushi, for example, which is substantially more than I'd pay in the best Tokyo sushi places.If you're looking for a Las Vegas type experience in Singapore, then this is the hotel for you. If you prefer quality over 'shock and awe' in a hotel, then stay somewhere else at one of the Asian brands.",278
MBS,3,"“Improvements made, but lacks a 5-star-hotel feel.”","Stayed for 4D3N under the Formula1 Grand Prix@ 20-22 Sep.Smooth check in,Later on the room key didn't work so had to get a new set :(Asked the Front Desk@Tower 3(Mr Stanley) does the BLUE or PINK color member card earn me SANDS REWARD POINTS? He didn't know :(When I approached the Tower 3 front office on 21 Sep, you can judge from their interactions with customers that its purely transactional, its so lacking compared to the excellent service delivered at Ritz-Carlton & Hyatt. I observed no smiles were exchanged between them & me during our conversation, sincerely disappointed in the mediocre service delivered by the Tower 3 reception.But good experiences@ the pool & gym.A little infuriated that the management irresponsibly closed down the SkyPark on Sep 21 & 22 for their own use, I wondered how fair this system is paying hotel guests are DENIED SKYPARK ACCESS on the 2 race days. This move displayed by the MBS management is an attempt to maximise its profit from the views its property has, & it is sad that the hotel is allowed to be managed in this way.Summing up, it was a good stay, worth the time because of the wonderful city view. My rating for service delivered throughout the resort is that of a 4 star hotel, take example my swim in the afternoon at the pool which had a water dispenser left empty for more than an hour, & we thirsty guests swimming in the pool were denied any (free) drinking water because some attendant forgot to refill water into this dispenser & even the lifeguard standing next to me couldn't be bothered about this service lapse!",122
MBS,3,“Love Love Love The Hotel But...”,"This is such a fantastic hotel. Really a wow hotel. Everything about our stay with our two children was 1st class except... if you are headed up to the pool and it is busy forget about trying to get any kind of service by the pool. The hotel is woefully understaffed in this respect, the waiters barely speak English and when they do get your order it is lost in translation. It is such a shame for such an expensive hotel. We loved everything about the Marina May experience however this experience took the shine off an otherwise very memorable stay. For the price we will likely be going elsewhere next year as the management were not able to resolve our concerns.",539
MBS,3,“more of a business hotel than an entertainment destination”,"I had no objective problems with the hotel or services at Marina Bay Sands. I was here on a business trip and it served that purpose very well. I am giving it a three star review based on my subjective opinion of how the resort compares to other adult-oriented entertainment and leisure destinations, particularly the casino resorts in Las Vegas and Macau. I don’t gamble much, but I like the bustling, crowded and fun atmosphere you find in those places. By comparison, MBS is honestly a little boring. The hotel isn't bad, its just disappointing. First the good things..The standard room was comfortable and well equipped. If anything, it was a little too spacious (you could have fit 3 king size beds in there with room to spare). Room on the 34th floor had great views of Singapore skyline. The place is really well organized, so the check-in and checkout was very fast and simple - same with the transportation to and from the airport. The hotel is also connected to the rest of the city by metro/subway.I didn't get to use the facilities as much as I would have liked, but the infinity pool on the top floor is a pretty cool thing to see and experience, I must say. MBS has a huge luxury shopping mall and a fantastic selection of food. I would highly recommend the Mario Batali Restaurant; the French place next to it, as well as the chicken rice at the food court.And now the bad/disappointing...My problem is that the overall feel of this place wasn't that different from the Changi Airport terminal: its shiny, modern, highly organized, full of expensive stuff and people walking around in business suits. There’s lots of great shopping and eating. But what about the FUN?!! I was here on business so maybe I shouldn’t complain about this, but I was hoping to let loose a little after my meetings, and was disappointed by the straight-laced, business-like vibe that continued well into the evening. I suppose you can’t blame the hotel management for this, as it’s largely due to “nanny state” regulations they have to comply with. The casino is kept separate from hotel and shopping center, and you have to pass through security with a passport just to get in. Besides, locals have to pay an upfront entry fee of 100 Sing dollars. Taxes on alcohol are so high that the bill for one small Tiger beer came out to 14 Sing dollars! All of this pushes away people who aren’t gambling addicts and aren’t super wealthy, but who just want to have a little fun without risking their kids’ college fund. What’s left is mostly sour-faced “high rollers” that are betting thousands of dollars per hand if not tens of thousands. I barely gamble at all, but I would have like to play a hand here or roll a few dice there, with a cocktail in hand, just to take in the atmosphere and have fun. I know Singapore has changed in the past several years, but the government still seems to believe that just a little bit of this harmless behavior could be the gateway to the entire population acting like the cast from \The Hangover\"".""",53
MBS,2,“Noisiest room ever!”,"we spent one night (thanks god) at this hotel, at 9th floor, road view, and we could not sleep because of the noise of the cars on the road. It seemed that the windows was open, but I checked and it was closed.The pool is a must see, but the noise was unforgetable!!!",160
MBS,3,“Underwhelmed - apart from the pool”,"We stayed at The Marina Bay Sands for two nights on the way back to Australia from Thailand, and expected great things.Firstly I admit, we didn't eat there, and not being drinkers, didn't use the bars.However, the room which we were give, floor 32, third tower, was nothing exceptional, apart from the view. Having stayed in Singapore on more than one occasion previously, this room was a huge disappointment. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom functional, but without the 'wow' factor we have experienced at other similarly priced hotels in SIngapore.The rooftop infinity pool is, however, exceptional...and being as you have to be a resident to use the pool, staying here is a necessity should you wish to experience what can only be described as a breathtaking view.Overall, if you take the pool out of the equation, this is a very average over-priced hotel.Would I stay there again?? Probably not.Would I recommend it?? Possible, just because of the pool.",272
MBS,1,“worst service not so good view”,"I know that every guy book here for swimming pool.yap. I agree that swimming pool is good and kuteta restaurant has nice view.but that's all you can expect from the hotel.no hospitality at all. no one try to listen to me if I ask.while waiting, we were in refresh room. it's like for homeless. I dont like to mention.I had 2 rooms reserved and 1 room was ready around 12. so we waited for another roomin the room prepared.Surely, we asked the hotel desk when the other room is ready so we can take a rest.Even it was ready, no one called me. I asked the front to bring the key sinceI got angry from no call back. no one showed up for more than 30 min. It made me crazy.the room is just spacious, not furnished well. and I try to adjust to room temperature but I couldnt make it. the answer is...no way to make room warm except turn off the air conditioner whole day... I did it so and made room 1 degree warmer..(I got a cold)the guy who helped me out for temperature thing, came to my room with dirty shoes so I askedhim to remove his shoes .... but he steped back and just stood He asked me to change the room and..no answer after he went back. Actually,I didnt like to change the room since we had a lot to pack again.Anyway, here is the worst hotel you dont need to spend a lot.I should have had to listen other guy's comment before I booked.Im very feel not good!not so good hardware & worst software MBS!",479
MBS,3,“Soulless”,"As a rule we do not tend to book at large hotels. Due to my husband being a keen swimmer and convenience for the F1 my husband chose to stay here.Having driven past this hotel many times, I admit it has a huge presence and is a spectacular piece of architectural brilliance. However, once you become a hotel guest it feels more like suffocating cage in a zoo. I realise that may sound a little harsh, and it could have been because the busy weekend due to the Grand Prix.You walk into a huge foyer area which runs the total width of all the towers. Its busy with guests, shoppers and people just wanting to photograph the hotel. Checking in was impressively quick even though there were lengthy queues. Staff throughout our stay were wonderfully polite, helpful and very efficient. Our premier room on the 7th floor was large, with neutral tones and had great views over the Gardens by the Bay. However, there was a number of stains on the soft furnishings and even though it had a large terrace area outside there were no seats to sit at and it looked odd just having an empty space. The bathroom was a good size but the shower was next to the bath with a narrow glass partition as a kind of wet room. The area felt awkward and the highly polished marble floor was dangerously slippery I felt. My husband did actually slip over as he walked out of the bathroom even though we had put down the bath mat outside the shower area to catch any spay. The beds are large and on the firm side but provided us with one of the best nights sleep We have had in a hotel.The pool on the roof is amazing but we struggled to find sun loungers to sit on and there was no shade whatsoever. Views are out of this world and the whole area had a Ibiza party feel to it. With music beating out and lots of very beautiful people sunning themselves. It's a great place to be with a group of friends but not a romantic spot for a couple! Hotel guest supposedly can only use the pool and they put a waterproof wristband on you.We only had room service breakfast which was very expensive and just average. I was very put off by eating or relaxing in the bar area in the foyer as it felt like a shopping mall, echoey and very noisy. The restaurants on the roof were fully booked so we are not able to comment on food unfortunately. I really had expected this hotel to wow me, except for the views and the shopping centre I felt it was a very large average business hotel, totally soulless, full of beige and fawn colours and very overpriced. A very disappointing stay.",228
MBS,3,“Expensive for what it is.”,"This is one of the more expensive hotels I've stayed at during my many trips to SIngapore.First, the positives: The views are amazing. The pool area is as stunning as the (many) photos on tourist sites would indicate although very crowded (I was there Thur to Sun so perhaps it is less busy Mon-Wed). Gorgeous bathrooms. Make sure you try to book a room with a balcony. The hotel itself is brand new and sparkling clean. If you're on the city side you will see a 10 minute light show each night on the water which is fun.The negatives: The crowds are appalling especially in tower 1 and very pushy and rude. The hotel should really try and do something about the huge line-ups to check in. The location is not as close to the \action\"" as the Fullerton or Stamford or Fairmont- the MBS mall underneath is rather sterile and really only seems to exist to give the wives of the guys in the casino something to do while their husbands are busy. Automated refrigerators in the rooms, which are my pet peve - if you move something the sensors automatically charge your room even if you don't consume it.Summary:I would stay here again if the company was paying but there are better located, less expensive options in SIngapore if I was paying for the room myself.""",257
MBS,3,"“Service was good, but I won't return for a second stay”","Despite the many negative reviews, I was lucky enough to enjoy pretty good service at Marina Bay Sands for my staycation. I know check-in queues are CRAZY at Tower 1, so I checked in Tower 3 at about 5PM, no queues at all and I was able to get my room immediately. I asked for an extra bed as there were 3 adults and 1 child staying in the room, and they've kindly waived off the charges for the extra bed.I left the room and only return late at night with a grumpy 2yo wanting to sleep, I entered the room and was dismay to see a baby cot instead. A call to the guest services and they managed to replace the babycot with the extra bed within 15 min. So thumbs up for that.Its great that the hotel was just next to Garden by the Bay, we made day trip to visit the tulip exhibition that happened during our stay. Followed by dinner at Satay by the Bay, a great alternative choice to the high-end restaurants at The Shoppes.However, been there done that. My husband and I feel that we will not return again for another staycation in Marina Bay Sands. It's not very family-friendly, there isn't much things available to keep a kid entertained for a few hours. The variety of restaurants are very limited for families with kids. For a slightly lesser price, we can get hotels located in Orchard areas with better selections of shops and F&B outlets, and also much bigger rooms.",38
MBS,3,“Pool is the attraction”,Other than the pool this place felt like a sterile - and expensive - expensive hotel.The pool is great though and worth the experience but after having stayed there once there is very little interest in going back.,137
MBS,2,“Go there only if you really want to try the (chilled!!!) pool”,Went there one night during our stay just because I'm a super fan of any kind of pools.so.. I had to try one of the most famous pool in the world.So... the pool is really amazing! Beautiful view especially at night.but is totally chilled!!! it s a super hotel... with a super famous pool.... I was freezing!!! all the people were freezing so we moved to the jacuzzi on the other side of the hotel.How is that possible!?!?!? Really???? With a room at almost 400 USD/night how is it possible that the pool is soo cold?!? Is it a joke?!If you are used to go to luxury hotel you won't find the service so special.. but just regular.rrrrIt's just the hotel itself to be massive and a unique experience. Loved the food court inside the Marina Mall!,144
MBS,3,“Average but not average prices”,I think the fact that this hotel accommodates such a huge amount of people makes it too impersonal and constantly busy. The foyer is like a MRT station in rush hour. If you are on floor 34 or above then the lifts you have to use go to the infinity pool on the 57th floor so the lifts are often wet from guests using the pool and returning to their rooms in wet bathrobes. The pool itself is quite stunning but a mass of heaving bodies and screaming children spoils the attraction. The rooms are pleasant and well maintained but certainly not 5 star standard. Food and beverage costs are crazy with a buffet breakfast with long queues going for S$38pp - much cheaper and better food quality in the restaurants in the shopping mall. It is an average hotel at 5 star prices.,254
MBS,3,"“Good For The Pool, And Not Much Else.”","It's obvious one stays at Marina Bay Sands for the renowned and spectacular pool, which is all the hotel really has going for it. It becomes quite an impersonal experience as soon as you enter the door, with random people who aren't even guests wandering around. The size of the hotel is the issue here, as there are so many rooms there's no way it can offer a personalised and well served experience, especially considering non-guests can get day passes to the pool. We were staying in executive rooms, which turned out meant nothing in the end, as the area where you could go for meals was tiny and consequently always crowded, (meant waiting for a table) with very little service or atmosphere - it felt like a buffet that was constantly trying to turn its tables over. The redeeming feature of this, however, was the pool, which is spectacular by day but incredibly crowded. My suggestion is to go by night, where only guests are around, it's still busy but you can find your own space, and the view is so much more beautiful. Overall the stay wasn't unpleasant, the hotel was just not a place one wanted to spend large amounts of time in because it was so packed. We only had a few issues, the biggest being when we specifically ordered a maxi-taxi but for some reason this was quite the task, and we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a cab while we stressed over missing our flight.",46
MBS,3,“Bird's eye view”,"Great beds, huge space, fantastic view, although I was quite disappointed with the totally unknown brand of toiletries, considering this was quite pricey from the other 5 star hotels.But I love the swimming pool and the experience of swimming on top of the world is priceless.",227
MBS,3,“Overpriced”,"We were disappointed from the moment we arrived. The lobby had an extremely long line to check-in. For such a large hotel, we expected this to better organized. I pre-registered before arrival, yet once we finally got to the check-in desk, the guy at check-in asked me all the same questions, so I am not sure what the point of sending customers a pre-register option.We stayed in a premier room and found that the room was average, it was large and clean but when you are staying in a five star hotel, its expected and its the little things matter. The button to close the curtains was across the room from the bed, which made no sense. Also there was no coffee maker and it took my husband and myself a few minutes to find the lights to the bathroom because it was located next to the front door, not the bathroom. These matters may seem trivial but when you spending a lot of money on a hotel, you want it to be perfect.However, I will give credit where its due. The view from the room was wonderful and the pool is amazing. I think its more value for money to pay for a day pass to the skypark for the view and to use the pool, rather then spend the money to stay at the hotel.",397
MBS,1,“Singapore service at its best?”,"August 13-15 : We had booked the room and requested for 2 double beds for a family of 4. Prior to arriving, I had called and reminded them and they said the request has been put in. Upon arrival to the hotel at 1.30pm and checking in, we were told the room was being clean and yes, we will have our request met. We went for lunch up at the beautiful deck and at 3pm came to collect out keys from the concierge. Again, we were told that we will have 2 double beds. Lo and behold, upon entry to our room, there was a king size bed! And so, the excitement begins. We called the front desk and was told there were no other rooms available but they will continue to look. Meanwhile, we turned on the television to keep our children busy and the greeting on the screen was for another guest! My husband was on the phone with them and firmly stated that this is not acceptable and they said they had technical difficulty with this room , so it was alright to give us this room? They had also said the room was unoccupied and was being clean. Which is which? We continue to wait and it was 4pm. Finally Peter Chin called and said there was a room and he will bring us to it. This was now 4.30pm. He came out of the lift, walked towards my husband , greeting him and walked off with him, completely ignoring the rest of us. Were we invisible or just chopped meat ? This is the not the level of customer service one would expect from a Singapore hotel that claims to be world class. The room we were given had a king and sofa bed for which we were pleased but it had a damp smell and the toilet had a piece of hair. Yes, I am being picky now after having to endure the wait and lack of hospitality. All this rude Peter offered was a late check out as if it was the best deal in town. I have to say, the better service came from the wait staff of other nationalities. Food prices were high and there was a minimum charge which is ridiculous. Lackluster and totally disappointing as this hotel is not world class nor efficient. Not worth it.",139
MBS,3,“What would they do without the swimming pool?”,"A lot of hassle with a tons of people everywhere and no warmth or feeling of an exclusive welcome! Queuing for the check-in at any time, queuing for breakfast, queuing - well almost - in the pool, or rather tin of sardines, to take a picture of the skyline. It is more like a nightmare. We have had warmer welcomes at that price in Singapore. Great, big, luxurious rooms and a great view - but only if you on floor 22 and above.Concierge - friendly but not really helpful, above all interested in advertising their own restaurants.Restaurant KU DE TA - good food but main courses too big especially as you are expected to eat 2 if not 3 courses to fulfill the obligatory 80SGD cover charge per person.This was really a ONE in a lifetime experience for us.",174
MBS,3,“Too overcrowded to enjoy”,"We were looking forward to our stay here as it was our last destination for a five night stay of a 28 day trip of Malaysia, we both felt let down upon our arrival as we felt we were treated like a number and were not welcomed by staff. Our room was very average, and stunk, view was of the gardens and nothing as spectacular as I expected. As for the pool, yes the view is a must to see but the time you spend trying to find two vacant sun lounges together is a joke, sun lounges are so close together and when your in the pool it is overcrowded and not very enjoyable. We didn't include breakfast when we booked as thought it would be too expensive and wanted to try different options, this place is so huge we walked forever to find somewhere to eat. As for the shopping in marina bay sands it was way out of my league just rediculously too expensive. Two nights would have been enough here.",93
MBS,3,“It was just O-K...”,"Stayed a night at the hotel for a weekend getaway. Didn't like the lobby as there were too many people/guests sitting around or queuing to check-in/out. Felt like a budget hotel. Spent almost 30 minutes queuing at the check-in counter for our turn. The rooms were clean, but decor was just so-so, nothing fancy. Also didn't like the idea where the swimming pools are opened to the public for a fee. It was packed like sardines in a can! Overall, it wasn't a very enjoyable stay, wouldn't pay this much to stay here.",74
MBS,3,"“Very nice, but too expensive”","My rating of this is two part. The hotel is very nice. I enjoyed the stay. It was convenient to head underground to catch the subway. The stores and casino were cool also, but all so very expensive. I didn't even consider breakfast there. It was more than my entire day's budget.On the other hand, the people were friendly and helpful and the pool at the top was definitely an attraction worth checking out.",136
MBS,3,“Nothing but the view~”,"We visited MBS in Sept 2011 to watch the annual F1 event. The hotel looks great from the exterior and we thought it would worth for the price. The lobby was very spacious and very crowded at that time when we checked in(also when checking out). We waited for almost an hour just to get our turn to register for check in. The service was way too slow and the frontdesk couldn't even figure out what room type we booked. It was pretty disappointing for the service.The room and bathroom were very tidy and clean but it just didn't have the renovation and the feel that a 5-star hotel should have. It looked like a 3-4 star hotel to me, like Ibis hotel.The only thing that satisfied us was the wonderful views from the hotel rooms.",39
MBS,3,“very impersonal”,"rather expensive and very impersonal. The pool was great, but very crowded. we were not met at the front door by a porter, and carried our own luggage into the hotel when we were dropped off by the cab.",51
MBS,3,“Only pool”,+ a pool negative:- staff (Raymond)- we had a club room (rather expensive which must be located between 35 and 49 floors) but we got a room on the 22nd floor and it took me 30 minutes to change our room- it is the first hotel where we were not accompanied,160
MBS,3,"“Amazing, unforgettable Pool. That's about it.”","We had one night in Singapore and we are glad that we chose MBS for that one night. But we wouldn't go back. The reason I say this is because it is worth spending one night in Singapore at the MBS for the pool alone; we got some memorable photos from the infinity pool which has to be seen to be believed. It was our first time in Singapore, and it simply has to be done. However, we would not return. The hotel is simply too big. Too brash. Too heaving with people. Too mobbed at the check-in counters. Too ostentatious. Too keen to demonstrate its luxury credentials. If you haven't been to Singapore before, and have a night to spend there - go to MBS for the thrill of the infinity pool. Beyond that, I'd say avoid - unless you enjoy feeling like one of the anonymised mass in the biggest hotel you have ever encountered in your life.",965
MBS,1,“A major disappointment”,"We decided to \splash out\"" on the final 2 nights of our honeymoon by staying here, but were left bitterly disappointed. Having stayed in the Mandarin Oriental for 5 nights (absolutely wonderful) we had even higher expectations of this iconic hotel and were looking forward to it all week, only for it to put a major dampner on our last two days.Upon arrival at the entrance, we were left to drag our own suitcases through the heavy doors alone and search for the check in desk. We waited for 15 mins before eventually being invited to check in. The process was long with very little interaction, however the \""receptionist\"" seemed to have plenty to type as he remained silent for most of the time whilst bashing the keys. My husband advised that we had booked a sea view but that as it was our honeymoon was there any chance of a city view instead. Plenty more typing but still very little actual talking, we were then advised that a room on the second floor was the only room available for our first night but that we could be moved to the 10th floor for our second night. We agreed, as we were advised in a very unfriendly manner that this was our only option. After we were given our key (still no chat - we were not even pointed in the right direction, just told we were in tower 3) we had to ask a member of staff passing us in the main reception area where to go. It was at this point we realised that nobody had offered to help us with our bags and it was obviously our own responsibility to find our room in this monstrous hotel - so far, not very 5 star.Once we found our way to tower 3 and the very short elevator ride to the 2nd floor, we got to our room. The \""view\"" was neither city nor sea... it was of 6 foot trees planted in a vain attempt to sheild the wall of noise from the dual carriage way directly outside our window. Not only this, noise from the main concourse of the hotel could also be heard from our room. Again, not very 5 star.After some discussions with reception and concierge, and some considerable waiting time, we were eventually moved to only a slightly better room. Despite the hotel only being a few years old, the carpets were stained and frayed, and the furniture tired. There was no bath and only a shower. There was also no \""dining guide\"" in either of our rooms, and with over 30 different restaurants to chose from we had no idea where to dine. Having asked the receptionist when we checked in if he had any recommendations based on the fact we were honeymooners, he had told us just to check the guide in our room. So when we were unable to source one of these so-called guides, we became frustrated again. We called the concierge and a guide was sent up to us, along with a recommendation for sky on 57 which we subsequently booked for our final night on honeymoon. At this stage we decided just to go into the mall to find somewhere to eat that night, with sky on 57 booked for the following night. The next morning we called the concierge to ask how we go about changing rooms as promised to us the day before, but nobody was aware of our complaints the night before. We then had to explain everything again, in attempt to justify why we had requested a better room. Eventually a member of staff was sent up to collect our luggage and we headed out for the day. When the time came for our meal at sky on 57 the place looked fantastic and we were excited for our dinner. However upon meeting the host at the front desk we were advised we did not have a reservation. On a positive note we were not turned away, and instead led to a table in the middle of the restaurant (no view!). After complaining again, we were then led to a window table where we enjoyed the company of a waitress with attitude who sarcastically called me \""cute\"" for moving to one side to allow her to pour my wine (i was being polite and to avoid having her nudge my shoulder). On another positive note our meal itself was fantastic.Before checking out the next day, we decided to use the iconc pool however even before 10am it was a real bun fight to get a poolside deck chair (so many dirty towels laid out it was difficult to tell which were free and which were still in use) and when we did find two together they were so close to the chairs next to us that it was again not exactly a luxury 5 star hotel poolside experience. It is also worth noting that the pool has a real beach club for under 21s feel about it with loud club music playing, far too many people packed in, and staff again with attitude. To summarise (!!) i feel that the MBS is too big a hotel with a severe lack of communication between staff and therefore a lack of continuity in the standard being provided. You are paying five star prices but do not expect five star service. A previous reviewer used the analogy \""zoo masquerading as a five star hotel\"" and i believe this to be acurate. Upon checking out, we were not even asked if we enjoyed our stay and as we dragged our own bags out to flag down our own taxi, we were extremely glad to be heading to Raffles for our pre-flight afternoon tea!!""",119
MBS,3,“$$$ PRETENTIOUS DECOR $$$ POOR SERVICE $$$ TOURISTS FROM CHINA+++”,"I suppose its the proximity of the casino that the Chinese really like this hotel, it is in the basement next door and they are all over the place talking loudly and doing what they usually do...buying all sort of gaudy luxury things. The staff tries to be polite but the volume they have to deal with is not conducive to the 4 star experience...totally falls flat right down to 2 star (maybe only 1.75 if it weren't for the pool). SERVICE REALLY SUCKS!!!Rooms are nice and bathrooms are beautiful. Even got the good ol' poop phone.stay here if you have a couple of hundred to burn for the night and enjoy the pool but otherwise that's about it.",1077
MBS,1,“A zoo maquerading as a 5 star hotel”,"I have consistently used trip advisor for recommendations for hotels as it is usually quite accurate but have never left a review. This stay was so atrocious that I decided to warn all other fellow trip advisor users. Before travelling to Singapore, i received many different recommendations from a couple friends. During our short stay in Singapore, based on our friends' recommendations, we stayed at Sentosa (the Capella) and at the St. Regis. We decided to add the MBS hotel at the tail end of our stay as it seemed like swimming in its pool was a necessity while in Singapore.Let's start with the \check-in\"" experience. We checked out of the St. Regis and had our luggage packed, got in a car and got to the MBS. Upon arrival, the amount of cars in its driveways was equivalent to a mini traffic jam. We waited at least 10 minutes for anyone to see our car and recognize that we needed help with our luggage for check-in. I was booked in a corner suite (which had VIP check-in), the person who asked us at the front didn't let us know so we lined up for check in. Check-in was relatively uneventful and we were shown to our rooms. The finishes were on par to an American Hilton (read 4* hotel, cheap furniture) and the bathroom had horrible shampoo, conditioner etc. which wasn't really a big issue. I called downstairs to have our bags sent up and waited in the room for 30 minutes after which we called again and they told us it was \""on its way up\"" and we waited another 20 minutes. We went downstairs and told them to send the bags up and that we would be back after shopping in the mall.We went back to our hotel room after about and hour and still no bags. Called down again and it was sent up about 5 minutes after. At about 11 PM, we decided to go downstairs to the casino and play a little. After playing for about an hour, we decided to take a walk outside. When we arrived back at the hotel, the doormen was busy conversing with each other and completely ignored guests (the doors are surprisingly heavy). We get to the elevator to go up to our room and the elevator is completely strewn with trash, bits of paper and just overall garbage. Not an issue, we get to our suite and in front of our door, some guest decided to throw KFC boxes and their leftovers all over our door. We side stepped it and got into our room. Its a big hotel, trash in the hallways is not a really big deal so we didn't bother reporting it.I had a web conference with my company in America and my laptop died at around 3AM in the morning. I call downstairs and ask for a travel adapter. The receptionist tells me that the adapter will be up shortly. At 3:15 am, I called downstairs (keep in mind, I had people waiting for me in America) and she goes it is on the way up. At 3:30 I call again and the receptionist lectures me telling me not to \""spam\"" their line and that I've called them 3X in the last half hour.I respect their request not for me to call back but at 4:00AM, still no travel adapter. I call down and they tell me its a large hotel. Despite the many rooms, I don't believe there are many requests at 4:00 AM in the morning. In fact, I tell them I have persons waiting for me in America and I will gladly go downstairs and get a travel adapter. They told me it was not necessary. At 4:30AM I call again and they said they were \""on their way up\"". Eventually, I get it at 5:15 AM, log on to my conference and everyone was gone.I call downstairs and ask for late checkout due to this fiasco and they tell me the hotel is fully booked and late check out is not possible. I eventually speak to a manager and get late check out.The pool is perhaps the biggest tourist trap of this hotel. It looks beautiful in its photos but in reality is filled with kids screaming and running about. There is an \""adults\"" only section which is right beside the family area so it really doesn't do much in regards to the screaming and running kids.When we decide to check out, we call downstairs as we need help with our luggage. We were in little bit of a rush. After twenty minutes, no bellboy for help with luggage so we take it all down ourselves. When we get to the check out line, a lady comes over, sees our luggage and goes \""checking in is actually this line sir\"". I said I know. She goes, \""why did you bring your own bags down, we have bell boys to help you with that\"" (we had a lot of luggage and we were obviously struggling with it). We explained we waited 20 minutes for a bellboy and nobody came up. She goes \""Oh\"" no apologies and walks away.The icing on the cake: We begin the checking out process and the manager happens to be checking me out. She asked me how I liked the suite amenities, I ask \""what suite amenities\"", she goes the VIP check in area, free breakfast, tea in the afternoons, amongst other things. I was not made aware of any of these amenities when I checked in. When I was at the ritz, I had a nice welcome letter which explained everything that was included with our suite. The manager apologizes and goes \""I'm sorry you weren't made aware; if you had any room charges, we would have removed it but since you don't theres nothing we can do.\"" Eventually I speak to higher management, was offered room upgrades, free night stay and a free ride to the airport. We took the free ride to the airport (and even with free nights will NOT be staying at this property again).I suppose everything would have been fine if you just booked a regular room with low expectations but if you're looking to get pampered, and stay at a 5* property, stay away from this junk hole. It is perhaps the largest tourist trap in Singapore and possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed at.""",353
MBS,2,“Very bad experience!”,"Unfortunately I have to say that my recent stay at this hotel was a very bad experience. During a stop in Singapore and a visit to the hotel, me and couple of friends decided to book our last night in such hotel after our trip to Bali. We booked the room personally at the desk more than two weeks in advance. The day we arrived they told us that only a room on the 3rd floor was available. (just over the receptions) and when we came there only one double bed was available. They told us they would have added an extra bed in the room, and that according to their policy only at the end they could see the availability of rooms and bed. Unfortunately althoug their assumptions the room was small and ok for two persons but not for 3.They assumend that even in 6 people can sleep in such rooms. Come on I said \ you can put 10 people but we are not slaves!\"".That was really astonishing for such level of Hotels. People book well in advance, came all the way after long trips and check in takes more than 1 hour, spend lot of money for a room you should expect of high level and that is the treatment??Unbelievable!!! I travel a lot for business as well and this is the first time I receive such type of treatment!Then I pretended talking to a manager, as the clerk there should have been appointed for another job.... and the manager tried to figure out a bit. She put us on 20th floor ( so other rooms where available!!!) but still they had to add a small bed inside the room.We spent 500eur for the same space in the room you can have in an hostel!After all this, my suggestion is: The hotel is huge and noisy, the rooms are nothing special...If you have some money to waste and really want to go to the swimmingpool on the top is ok.But if you need a confort stay or are a business traveller then there are much better options in Singapore.""",328
MBS,3,“5 star property with 4 star comfort and 3 star service”,"arguably the most talked about hotel in singapore, this hotel failed to hit the spot. we arrived by taxi and it was probably peak time with check outs. there were bags piled up in front of the mail entrance. i couldn't get anyone to help us with our 2 suitcases - we had a child in tow as well along with all the little bags that come with travelling with a young child. never mind that, the check in queues were crazy long as well - only cos there was a tonne of people crowding the front desk to check out. fortunately for us, another line opened up and we didn't have to wait too long before we got our room key. we turned to head to our lifts. there was staff hanging around, chatting amongst themselves, talking, laughing... no one lent a hand with our bags. my son kicked off his shoes and helped. service aside: the front desk could have been located further inside the hotel. being such a large hotel, it just seems silly to park your front desk so close to what is a fairly narrow entrance given the size of the hotel. people crowded around that same spot adding to a human traffic. guests trying to check out, guests trying to check in and people just waiting for friends ... it all makes for a very messy and unimpressive lobby.the rooms: faultless. we had one facing the singapore river and skyline. it was spacious too! the beds and pillows weren't that great. perhaps it's not geared towards comfort.the pool: stellar! impressive to say the least even though we were there at the height of the mid year haze.the food court is atrocious. one of the vendors tried to cheat me of my change. tsk tsk... it was pretty clear it was deliberate. that aside, the food there is terrible. you are better off cabbing it to nearby Lau Pa Sat or Gluttons Bay.",316
MBS,3,“It was worth seeing at least once in your life.”,"I discovered this hotel through a picture that my cousin posted on instagram and thought it had an amazing view by the pool. So I made sure that I get to experience it when I visited my cousins who lives in SG. To be honest, I found this hotel to be very inconvenient to stay in. Depending on the room assigned for you, we had to switch buildings just to gain access to different facilities like the sky deck pool or the gym. And you had to have your key card with you at all times when using the elevator. Plus if you don't do it right, the elevator automatically leads you to the ground floor. It sorta felt like I was in a maze that goes up and down, plus it had long halls just to lead you to the other tower on a specified floor.I originally wanted to book a room for 4 people, no website allowed me that option without booking two rooms. This hotel costs too much, for 300 bucks a night that doesn't even include breakfast. Every person who wanted pool or gym access had to be registered with the hotel because they give out cards for each person then they tie a wristband on you once you're there. Its another whopping 100 bucks I think if you want to register more people to gain facility access. I felt like I was going clubbing in a Toronto Cabana bar minus the gorgeous ladies just to gain pool access. This is more of a family hotel rather than a party hotel with people in their 20's. I really think this place focuses more to rip you off than do actual customer service. It did have an amazing view still, it's the best view of Singapore's new skyline because the buildings in front of the hotel were mostly built not too long ago.",90
MBS,3,“Service is very bad”,We booked this hotel as we wanted to use the sky pool. The person at reception was very rude and we had to wait for 20 minutes to actually check in. Our room wasn't ready despite the fact that we had arrived at 6pm. We waited over one hour and a half for it to be ready and had to go back to the desk to check ourselves. The staff at the sky pool were nice which made a difference. The pool is amazing! The room was also really nice.,119
MBS,1,“Seriously Need To Sort Out The 'Gift Shop' - A Complete Rort”,I had the misfortune of being completely fleeced by the 'gift shop' located on the ground floor of the area between Tower 3 and Tower 2. Wanted a small gift for a Singapore host and was very short on time. Knowing host was a reasonable Scotch Whisky drinker chose a 700cl bottle of Johnny Walker Black Label. Price was $S190.00. This is nothing but an absolute rort - especially when staying in this place and wandering around found exactly the same product at another outlet for $93.10. Naturally extremely angry. I'm still staying in the place and generally it is OK - it should be for the price. Would not stay her nor recommend it. The added value isn't.,114
MBS,2,“Just stand at the Frount Door and throw your money at them its faster”,"Talk about over priced and over rated. Yes its a wonderful hotel, real class , loverly ambiance , but boy - they dont know the meaning of Value. Rooms are nice, and of course its in a great spot, BUT why would anyone pay $980 per nightwithout breakfast .? I booked and after looking Cancelled - I expected Dubai 6 star plus , but got 5 star - pay money because its a landmark in singapore price. May I suggest you , stay at any of the other $350-$400 priced - 5 star Hotels and spend the savings on your self in the shopping areas.yes ok its nice - BUT its really OVER Rated.",178
MBS,3,“Overated”,"Stayed in April for my mums birthday. There was three of us so we decided to get a suite with the Club Facilities. All it was, was a larger room. Nothing flash. Nothing fancy. We had a balcony with no table or chairs on it to sit at. Although the pool area is amazing, it is extremely hot. The Club is on the top level overlooking the pool to one side and Gardens By the Bay on the other side. So it was nice to sit there for a few included drinks. The food in the Club was disappointing. Not a lot of choice, mostly seafood based, and two out of three of us do not eat seafood. At the Club there was always a queue to get a table - so you must get there early. The lobby is huge with many people just sitting or standing around. There are not enough seats either. This hotel is well positioned for a weekend like we did - visiting Gardens By The Bay, shopping and casino across the road.",73
MBS,3,“The feature and amenities are good but the the service”,The feature and amenities are good but the the service.3PM is the check in time we came at 5PM yet there is no room! we reserved the room then technically the room should be available.The rooms are good and I love the idea that a keycard is needed when using the elevator to go to your rooms. this is safe and for security purposes. And of course the infinity pool.. it is amazing,295
MBS,3,“Not quite up there..”,"Me and my wife spent 3 nights at this hotel in mid-August 2013. This was not our first visit to Singapore, it was our third. This time on our way back from Bali.The first impression of the hotel from the outside is fantastic, but as you walk inside this impression subsides! Very impersonal, kinda \cold\"" and unfriendly. The room: Club room in tower 2 with access to the club for breakfast and afternoon snacks etc. Modern with all the usual amenities, with a poorly stocked mini bar and a central unit for air-con which at times brought kitchen smells into the room! Large enough, but not a lot of space for luggage. Great views of the bay and city.The pool: A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! Crammed - literally! - with screaming children in the \""no children allowed\"" area!! making it impossible to swim or even have a dip except only for a photo or two.The club: Very friendly staff but with no great variety of fresh, good quality food ( fresh juices etc).Afternoon snacks and canapes of mediocre quality too. Only used it once on the day we arrived and although it could save us a lot of money, never used it again (because we had booked a club room we had access and free afternoon nibbles), despite the fact that in our journeys around the world we tend to book these rooms and enjoy the club facilities.Main advantage of the hotel: The attached shopping mall, which is GREAT and very easily accessible from the hotel. So: if you are a shopaholic, this is probably the place for you. Now having said that, you could easily stay at another hotel - Pan Pacific is a good alternative - and still visit the mall for shopping or dinning.""",207
MBS,3,“Must try when in Singapore”,"I could have stayed with friends who reside in Singapore but everybody I know who has been there says its the best luxury hotel in Singapore that one must experience so I booked a 2 nights stay (through my usual booking site that gives me great last minute discounted deals on http://bit.ly/1cNubn5). Our Room was clean and comfy (as expected from a 5star luxury hotel). The sky park pool are was crowded when we got there so we had just drinks, took some photos, and enjoyed the view. We decided to come back earlier the next day and took a dip after our buffet breakfast (which was worth the extra cost judging from the good breakfast selection and cocktail hour treats). Hubby would have liked to have had a game of golf had he known that it was a luxury resort & golf hotel too (ok I will admit that I tried to keep that to myself because I did not want to go around town alone haha)Service was average-good except for check-in (understandably so because hundreds of people come and go but next time, if there is a next time, I just might spend extra for a suite to get VIP treatment and faster check-in times).",52
MBS,3,"“Comfortable place to sleep, room service fast.”","Stayed at tower one. Rooms are smaller than the last time, no bath tub. Most of reception at the lobby is empty. It will be good to have staff at every lobby reception counter. Rooms are comfortable and nice to sleep. Room service is fast. Waited lift for more than 2 minutes.",42
MBS,3,“mediocre.”,"had a reservation, arrived at the hotel at 10am they told me they have no rooms, waited until 5pm.the skypark is amazing experience in the morning later it becomes crowded.it is worth coming for one night for the skypark experience nothing more",127
MBS,3,“Worth One Night Only”,"Stayed with the family for one night at the end of a Singapore family holiday. It really was disappointing, even the pool (and that was the best part). Our room had a gap between the window and the outside which required some workmen to fix it. The lobby was crowded but manageable. Rooms were not up to usual 5-star standard of many other hotels and the toilet did not flush properly. The metal bars in the lifts already had their finish wearing away. It was close to the Gardens by the Bay but it requires a circuitous route to get there. Disappointed by the lack of staff discipline at the taxi area where the staff allowed private cars to collect people without regard for the taxi line.",71
MBS,3,“Not worth it.”,"The only thing that made us to book this hotel was Skypark. Spending few hours on top and enjoying swimming pool views was a good experience, but in general hotel isn't about good service but expensive prices. Rooms are average, service is poor, constantly overcrowded on the first floors. One night is more than enough to experience Skypark, but there is plenty hotels around with better views, service and better rates.",361
MBS,2,“Triumph of style over substance”,"We were really excited to stay here with an interest in the building design etc. Unfortunately we overlooked the fact that this hotel primarily exists as an attractant for the associated casino. Checking was dire with half an hour in a queue only to find that no room was ready for us and an hours wait was necessary. Following this we were required to queue again to check to see if our room was available. The usual debit of the credit card was required but not the $100 stated by the desk clerk but actually $200! Fine but still necessary for us to pay the credit card fee on this even if it would be recreated at checkout. Finally we got to our room and were taking in the view when the door opened and the bags were delivered unannounced! Quite surprIsed we were but fortunately clothed! No info as to how to drive the room and its features - not a big problem to us but to some others it may well have been. Breakfast buffet was extensive but once again there were too few staff to cope and a major queue to wait in until tables were cleared and and made available. Pool is very nice with spectacular view - a bit overhyped. Unfortunately my husband slipped on the very slick boardwalk beside the pool and narrowly escaped a head injury but with badly bruised shoulder. None of the hotel staff were attending to pool safety issues although there were many children. Service at the poolside cafe was dire and the charges foR really second rate food (cold fries, and the worst hotel club sandwich I have ever encountered, beef satays that were very tough). Cost of this small meal was Sgd$72.03!! We complained about the food but received no feedback whatsoever. Beautiful room had filthy windows - not just the usual external condensation expected in a hot climate. The hotel is clearly understaffed - maybe a combination of the US management style of the Sands corp and the poor service standards of many Singapore establishments. I offer these comments as someone who lived in Singapore for 10 years.",90
MBS,3,“Nice hotel”,Your first time Singapore? Definitely stay here. Nicely decorated hotel and every staff we've met was friendly and helpful. Although the hotel is really really large and sometimes feels almost like a factory( i understand that a personal touch is just not possible with this much rooms) everything feels and looks luxury. From the rooms (lovely amenities) to the entree and the building itself. The pool on the 37th is unbelievable and just for the pool you'd have to stay in Marina Bay Sands at least once in your lifetime.,228
MBS,3,“Disappointed”,"We stayed here with our family and had two rooms. Firstly we had requested as early checkin as possible as we had just flown in from Johannesburg, we could not get into one of the rooms until 5pm and the second one at 6pm which seems ridiculous when check out is 11am. Secondly they put our three girls in a room at one end of the third floor and us at the total opposite end, this seemed odd as again I had asked that we be as close as possible together. They would not change us or offer any renumeration in any way for this.I felt for what we had paid for the stay that although the rooms are lovely and the view from the 57th floor and the pool outstanding that the service was very average and we felt quite ripped off and that it is just a big hotel wanting to push people through the doors to spend their money at the casino. The wait at the check in and check out counter was also so slow. The hotel lacks atmosphere with no seats or waiting areas in the lobby apart from actual restaurants.I would recommend going to visit this hotel to see the view but would not recommend staying here as I think you can do far better with the choice there is in Singapore.",470
MBS,2,“A surprise let down on service”,"As most travelers will know when you book a club level room in a hotel you are anticipating a level of service above the norm. In Singapore its hotels pride themselves on the service level to keep customers coming back. So this made this review even more surprising as its a first for me experiencing poor club level service!Our surprise started at the front door as first time guests we were advised to go to check in and the luggage was taken by the porters. The 15 minute wait in the queue was an indication of what was to come. We finally were at the desk and the check in was processed. As there was no room ready we were told we could use the facilities but to go to VIP check in to collect our room key once the room was allocated! VIP check in!! It would have been nice to know before the 15 min wait.Then the information of how to get to your room and the way you have to remember to get to the pool / club room is a challenge for the first time visitor. In tower two you have to go to level 55 in a very fast elevator, then go through security (who never did put that wristband on that everyone was wearing. Too busy chatting I think) Then take another elevator that takes the same time to get up 2 levels. Then you are at the pool and have to remember to do the same to get back!As I mentioned there was an indication of what was to come. In the hotel web page it advises you have exclusive access to the pool. However with over 2,500 rooms that access feels very public. To the extent that after waiting 50 mins on one day in the pool as there were no towels. We then had to grab towels from a trolley as most of the exclusive guests were raiding it before it could arrive at the towel station!As a club level guest you enjoy other benefits such as club room for snacks, drinks and breakfast with a view. However that too had an oversupply of exclusive guests and each time we went to it we had the pleasure of waiting in a queue! To be fair the room was nice, well cleaned and appointed. The staff in the club room were surprisingly friendly given the duress that the number of guests they were having to deal with was giving them.This hotel seems to have made a surprising mistake in its concept or design that it can not cope and provide an above average service level for its club level guests in a way that you would be tempted to return. Its sad but you need to know before you spend the money.",316
MBS,3,"“Less is more Part 64 – If You Build It, They will Come”","That line from \Field of Dreams\"" (starring Kevin Costner) certainly applies here with the relentless crowds streaming through the building 24/7. I too have returned for the 3rd time not because I love this hotel but because of its convenience to the convention facilities across the street (where i was attending an exhibition). Since my first stay the crowds do not seem to have abated although a mid-morning check-in was sorted out in under 8 minutes. They are trained to process you as swiftly and efficiently as possible so don't blame them if the proceedings come off as somewhat mechanical and a trifle cold. This is no \""Cheers\"" where everybody knows you name.The super-scale architecture is still visually stunning (although the initial awestruck jaw drop is over and done with) and while my busy schedule did not allow me to dip in the glamorous destination rooftop pool so i could check off one of the \""500 things I need to do before I die\"", I still remember the amazing views with great fondness. I also skipped the complimentary breakfast this time around to avoid the \""shopping mall-like queues\"" and opted ironically for a more tranquil Coffee Bean breakfast in the adjacent Shoppes @ MBS. The immense popularity of MBS is clearly showing in the room appearance and after just over 2 years, the wear and tear is beginning to surface particularly in the carpeting, wall/window coverings and bathrooms. That seems unfortunate for the premium you pay (>SGD420) for a regular suite in Tower 3. I suppose thats the price you pay for the privilege to stay here in class-conscious SG?On a positive note, I was pleasantly surprised at the speed my request for a bandaid was attended to (less than 10 minutes). But if that was the only highlight of my stay this time, what is there to look forward to for my next stay here?""",313
MBS,3,“Visually amazing hotel ... hated being photographed by non guests at pool”,"We stayed on the 30th floor (with two separate rooms) for 2 nights. Amazed by the crowds and masses of people checking in and the volume of 'people traffic' through the ground level of the hotel. After some 'discussion' re our rooms (we were offered various alternatives for rooms in separate towers, separate floors...finally we found after some lively discussions 2 rooms that were side by side for myself and my elderly mother) we were shown up to our rooms. Both lovely, spacious and very well presented. Breakfast was downstairs, lots of selections offered, very attentive and informative staff, again masses of people. I did feel I was in the middle of some huge shopping mall rather than the eating area of a hotel. We had some conflicting advice if we could eat upstairs by the pool...however it turns out we only could eat downstairs.The concierge desk was very helpful and gave very good advice on walking times to nearby attractions and transportation, the taxi ramp at the end of tower 3 worked very well too.The pool is obviously pretty amazing, not so crowded when we were there and we easily got 2 lounges together to sit for a while. Only disappointment which did feel a huge lack of privacy where a few tour groups being led along the top of the area behind the sun lounges....they were not allowed to venture off the pathway...but madly taking photos of the pool (AND those in it) with their 30 camera's all clicking away.....totally unacceptable when you are paying over $500 per night to have a bus load of tourists, not even staying at the hotel, led to where they just stand gawking at you snapping photos. VERY distasteful and think a huge money grabbing opportunity by the hotel. Makes the paying guests feel like zoo animals being photographed by a group of happy snappers!!",125
MBS,1,“Overcrowded Zoo”,"This hotel is one of the worst places I have ever stayed. There are several reasons I feel this way:It is so overcrowded that you have no personal service and have to queue for everythingThe pool area is impossible to enjoy with no seats and hundreds of screaming childrenThe price for food and accommodation is so out of touch with the rest of SingaporeThe other guests are so busy trying to beat you into lifts, restaurants, bars, reception etc you feel like you need to fight your way around the hotel 24/7If you are like me and want to have great service, relax with a great pool, enjoy good restaurants with food and wine I would recommend the Mandarin Oriental over this zoo every time.",63
MBS,3,“Upgraded”,I booked a normal standard room but then got upgraded to the Presidential Suite. The only thing I have in praise of this hotel is our room. Someone vomited in the pool and I told the life guard and he just sat there. The restaurant felt like you were in a train station and the service was slow and food wasn't good either.,61
MBS,3,“jul 2013”,"stayed here fora day while transiting.beautiful hotel, extremely packed..in fact too crowded.stunning pool but no avail lounge chairs by pool and pool was too crowded. restaurants were packed and there were line ups everywhere.I would stay here again for short stays but the crowded areas would drive menus if I had to stay longer.great locationcasino in basement. it was ok....just ok.",503
MBS,3,“Perfect for just a short interval”,"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was just average as compared to the other 2 '5-stars' hotels prior to MBS. There's things I would like to point out. Being a 5 star hotel, one would expect services catered would be of high class. However that is not always the caseUpon arrival, I'm not sure whether we arrived in a cheap taxi have something to do with this but My partner and I weren't assisted in carrying the luggage out from the taxi. The hotel staff instead ,with their whistles, busy directing taxis. It is until we were almost near the entrance that we were asked, 'Are you checking in?' and got assisted.Then, proceeding to the VIP Lounge, not really welcoming, with quite a queue. Female staff, can't remember name, acted like just wanted your money and getting out of her time as quickly as possible. I booked my stay from the 25th July onward to 28th July in a Club Room under the honeymoon package deal. As I mentioned it is quite a busy hotel, don't be surprised that you will be allocated to whatever room is available upon check-in, no options to choose from or your requests during booking will not be met, and so I was allocated to 36th floor (Club rooms runs from 35th to 49th). Fair enough, 36th floor with city view is high enough I guessed. Upon arrival in room, I was surprised we were allocated in an interconnecting room. I understand I booked the 'Honeymoon Package', meaning we wanted privacy. However, that is not the case, loud pulling of bathroom chairs, loud conversations from next door can be heard from our room through that connecting door.Although the club privileges are convenient, breakfast in the club is mediocre at best. There is not much variety in the food section. Different days you get different noodles and perhaps a change in dim sim, that's it. The rest is the same, well for the 3 nights period we were there for. Didn't bother to use other timely club offers in a the Club.Of all the negative points I mentioned, there are however some positives as well. Firstly, the city view is great from the room, different times throughout the day. Secondly, the priority service button on the phone. Your requests will be handled very quickly and professionally. Staff answering that line are also very informative. Thirdly, the skypool was a great experience, however we had to get out due to severe thunderstorms. Lastly, In room dining offers an extensive range of menu and the food was delicious!!Overall, our stay would have been a perfect honeymoon if it weren't for those negative points. It has a huge impact on our impressions as it was our first time staying in MBS and received this kind of treatment. In the future, I would only recommend to stay here, maybe for a short period of time (1-2 nights) only just to experience the skypool. Sorry to say but take your romantic getaway somewhere else.",133
MBS,3,“Overpriced and overcrowded”,"The view from the hight located rooms is totaly amazing, beds are comfortable, rooms are clean and big, lots of space and air.But the price for staying, for mini-bar, for breakfast are too hight for the level of service hotel provids. Had to wait an hour for our room to get ready (well, that`s ok) and after getting back to the reception was told to wait extra 2 hours or get the cheaper room 10 floors down from the offered previously. Had a quite long conversation with different managers before getting the room. Service is very poor, filling yourself not like in 5* hotel but like at the airport. Also some stuff is not so welcoming as tyou are expecting them to be. Had a very mixed emotions. Won`t stay there next time.",968
MBS,2,"“Beautiful hotel, but disappointing service”","I'm challenged to positively recommend this hotel. I booked based on the obvious pros: (i) five star service, (ii) magnificent pool, and (iii) good location, but feel the cons outweighed them in the end. I stayed three nights and paid for a premier room with a city view. Pros:1. The rooms were clean and well-kept. They were what you would expect from a five star property, with plenty of space, free bottled water and excellent amenities (the brand specific was to the Marina Bay Sands but good quality). 2. The location was phenomenal in terms of access to tourist attractions in Singapore and speed getting to and from the airport. I'll note that I did go back and forth to the airport twice and paid completely different rates depending on the taxi. There was a system in place, so it would be worth looking into if you want to accurately set your expectations.3. The pool was impressive, but the pictures do a poor job of showing how busy it is. This isn't a serene, calm area. There are children, and they aren't necessarily being watched closely by their parents. Additionally, the pool isn't heated and the contrast to the outside air is a bit shocking. Though this pool ranks on the top lists in the world, I can't help but feel it was a bit of a disappointment in terms of the 'serenity-factor'.4. The gym was the highlight of the entire hotel. It's on the 55th floor just below the pool and has floor to ceiling glass. The yoga room is the best I've seen in terms of views, and the gym equipment is top notch. Beyond this, the staff were consistently phenomenal. If you go to this hotel, don't miss visiting the gym.Cons: 1. The bellboys were slow to help but quick to take our luggage. Once they have your bags, they are scanned into a system and you can't access it after that point. This was a challenge when we were subsequently told we had a lenghty wait to get access to our room. We were overdressed for the weather, and while it was nice of them to offer access to the pool, we couldn't use it given we had nothing to change into. Poorly done.2. Check-in was a mess. In a hotel with over 2,500 rooms, it was stunning to be told that we couldn't get a room without paying until 3pm. We were offered a downgraded room for the first night (no compensation) that had two beds, or a higher-floor room with a view but only a king bed after a 2-3 hour wait. The room we booked would only be available at 3pm. I understand hotels have no obligation to be flexible in this, however the way in which they conveyed this information and that we were told we probably couldn't get the room we had booked if we decided to take another room earlier (downgrade but without compensation) are things I haven't experienced at any five star hotel in the past. Neither did I expect this information to be conveyed to me with such cold disinterest.3. Hospitality suite: There is no seating in the lobby. After asking several staff, I was informed the front desk could offer access to a hospitality suite. Why they didn't offer this right away was beyond me until I walked in the door. This suite was packed with people and an absolute mess. The garbage was over-flowing, there were empty water bottles all over the counters, and it looked like they made no effort to keep it clean. 4. Printing a boarding pass: this shouldn't be an issue, but it was. The business center did not have a sign on it stating that it was closing early (national holiday), so when I came down at 8pm and couldn't get in I approached the concierge desk. They informed me that it was closed and they couldn't print a boarding pass. I pushed this, and after several minutes discussion and my starting to get upset they finally relented. I've never had an issue asking a hotel to print a boarding pass before, especially a five star hotel. In this case I actually had to go so far as to remind them of this fact.5. Room cleaning: On the second day of my stay, I left the maid service sign on from 8am when I left. When I returned at 4pm the room hadn't been cleaned. I called down to inquire and they said they would send someone up in an hour. I was with my mother who wanted a nap, so I re-requested that they wait until we call later in the evening (I was told they had 24/7 cleaning staff). 10 minutes after I had confirmed this request, they came to clean the room. To get around the sign I had adjusted to \do not disturb\"", they called the room and woke my mother. Realistically, Singapore has a plethora of five star hotels. I've been to a couple and would recommend them over the Marina Bay Sands. It lacks personal service and that special touch, likely challenged by it's size.I did follow-up with complaints both while I was visiting the hotel and in an email shortly after leaving. I wasn't looking for compensation in either case, but neither did I feel I should be a training opportunity for their staff. They did state they would investigate, even going so far as to look up camera footage for confirmation, however their response back was along the lines of \""thank you and we hope to see you again next time\"". Honestly, next time I'm heading back to the Four Seasons.This review is fairly comprehensive, but if you'd like more details feel free to check out the full post here: http://frivolousflyer.blogspot.ca/search/label/Singapore""",93
MBS,3,“Worth a one or two night stay for novelty and no more”,"Stayed here with my Dad visiting Singapore in May. It was worth the stay purely for the pool swim and a few drinks at Ku De Ta overlooking the city. Beyond that, this hotel doesn't know the meaning of service. Essentially, regardless of what class of guest you are, you are mere cattle, there to follow the exceptionally Singaporean rules (of which there are many) and pay for extras here there and everywhere.My recommendation, go for a night or two max, and stay somewhere super-nice and boutique for the rest of your stay.",115
MBS,2,“Standard of hotel”,"Hotel and pricing not reasonable, when comparing with quality of services. Due to many visitors from Casino, mostly from China, waiters and waitress and Housekeeping cannot speak good English. Customer service ll not pick up the phone after 1800hrs, don't know why. The check in line was incredible long and take around 45 minutes up to one hour.Been staying here for 4times already, only check out service and quality of breakfast are good.During check out, there was fast check out service with manager carry IPAD to serve you, and that was super fast.Poor quality of shampoo and soap.If I don't have conference to attend, this hotel is not at all my preferred destination to stay.",176
MBS,3,“Totally Overated”,"Stayed here for 2 nights in late July 2013. The good thing is that there is extensive shopping and eateries adjoining this very average hotel. It has been hyped as something special, but the only thing that can be said is that the place is enormous and the logistics must be impressive. But that is all. The reception/lobby is more like an airport than a hotel. The artwork and sculpture is crass and rubbish. The delays that we saw other people having were unbelievable and frightenintg. Trying to check out is also a nightmare.We stayed here to check out the SkyPArk and the pool. It looks great at 11:00 in the morning but terrible at 4:00 in the afternoon. It was like Brighton beach. Terribly overcrowded too many kids such a disappointment. Never again. Singapore has hundreds of better hotels than Marina Bay Sands and I would suggest that you go to the others and don't stay here.Overpriced, overrated and too many plebs stay here. This is Crass and Mass tourism. Avoid it like the plague.",107
MBS,2,"“No hospitality, one night stay is very enough”","If you are planning to stay in this hotel, please stay in only one night.In order to get into the famous pool, you need to stay in the hotel. The pool is exclusive for hotel guests.But once you go to the pool, must be dissapointed.It is just small pool that is packed by loudly group.The pool is too small for huge hotel.I stayed three nights.But I didn't get any services from hotel guys through my staying.In my room, there weren't bathing tab, only shower...Their lifts are too slow, every morning you have to be patient.So for taking photos in the pool, one night staying is very enough.",176
MBS,2,“You wouldn't stay here if it wasn't for the pool!”,"The place is just trading off the SkyPark - service is overall pretty poor. We stayed Sat - Mon and I would advise anyone to avoid a weekend - the Sky park is heaving and the place can't cope...try getting a drink at the poolside, bar table or 6 feet of water to yourself! Particular issue is their room cards - changed them four times before we got ones that reliably worked - apparently its a known problem and they will change the system, but small comfort - you need them for the lifts and many rooms are two lift journeys away from reception - in and out in the slot multiple times before they work in the lift or the door. Customer service answer? New cards that are just as bad...and btw no small queue at reception to get them.....they tried the \don't keep them near a mobile excuse\"" first time, but finally admitted it was a system problem. But that's a specific issue. Overall, the place just doesn't feel welcoming and service is slack.""",215
MBS,3,“My Feelings Are Mixed”,"I almost want to say that this is very good if I think of the infinity pool on the 57th floor and how awesome it is because it is so unique and at the same time average because it is quite expensive but the toilet clogged when we first checked in. That was terrible! The maintenance arrived quickly and that was good. But for a very expensive hotel, all of these things matter especially toilets. I also like to have coffee first thing in the morning. They didn't even have a brewer for coffee. They had a boiling pot but NO COFFEE nor milk or sugar. For the price you pay for the hotel, they can't even provide you with coffee? Even the cheapest hotel in the USA provides lots of coffee with cream and sugar. When we ate at the buffet at the Rise restaurant, the bill was $1,000 for ten of us. It wasn't like they had lobsters and all that. To me, we had better buffets in the East Coast! Unless your company is paying the price for the hotel and your food, it would be hard for someone to pay their regular price.BUT NO COFFEE and BREWER is UNACCEPTABLE FOR A HOTEL THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY ONE OF THE BEST IN SINGAPORE.",166
MBS,1,“Check your credit card statement after your stay”,"I have the same experience of another reviewer of being mysteriously charged after checking the credit card statement.I went with my family last week, my second time staying at Marina Bay Sands as the experience of first visit was very good.I booked 3 rooms through my agent (Singapore airline package), breakfast included for all adults and children, and all paid up before the trip. At the check-in, they swipe my card, claim that it wouldn't charge if no consumption of minibar/payTV or other special services. Staying on the second floor, quite noisy. On checking out, i confirm with the staff that no charge would be incurred and that they would void the deposit I previously signedHowever, when I am back to Hong Kong and check my credit card account, I am shocked to learn that there are 3 item-charges of the same amount on the day of cheek-out, no idea of the nature. I've sent the e-mail to the hotel and still haven't got any reply.",152
MBS,3,“Quite underwhelming really”,"Despite great expectations, I just didn't really love this place. On the plus side, the architecture is fascinating, the pool is amazing and we had great views over the Gardens by the Bay. Our room was modern, well appointed and the bed was very comfortable.But, the pool was very busy, quite cool (temperature) and finding an available sun lounge was like finding gold. Check in/check out was like grand central station, and you needed a compass and a packed lunch before setting off for breakfast (at Rise). Which by the way, was totally forgettable.In fairness to Marina Bay Sands, I had just spent 3 nights at Raffles, and by comparison it was liking comparing McDonalds to a fining dining restaurant.Whilst modern and interesting, MBS is gargantuan and seemed quite souless. I'm glad I got a chance to stay and use the Skypark/pool but I won't be back. It really isn't my style.",41
MBS,3,“A 5star casino hotel”,"Just another casino hotel, nothing special to speak about. Positive points were the pools, of course. Check in and check out were efficient, hassle free. Breakfast were 5star standard, no special points though.Rather like a shopping mall, too many people inside.",214
MBS,3,“disappointing”,"Apologies but I havent really many good things to say about mbs, sure its an impressive looking building, not necessarily beautiful but certainly imposing, and the skypark swimming pool is certainly worth a look. Now staying here was a bit of a splurge for us, $400 a night or thereabouts, an amount we would not normally spend. Anyone considering staying here should request, if the room is on the freeway side, at least a high room, ours was on the third floor and the noise from the traffic was incredible, I think its one of the freeways to the airport, so it is busy at all times. There appears to be no effort at soundproofing at all, consequently a couple of sleep interupted nights. The room was very nice, as should be expected at this price, I think the sensors in the mini bar are over the top, the operators obviously consider their customers as all potential thieves. The staff were pleasant enough, the shopping mall huge (no natural light or windows to outside) and containing the usual prestige, name brands...not much new and pretty bland. Oh yes, and $45pp for breakfast? No thanks.The road noise has obviously influenced our opinions and affected the enjoyment (or lack) of our stay at mbs. Disappointing really.",53
MBS,3,“5 star jail.”,"I was stayed for family holiday. it was like 5 star jail, every way needed pass. i with family & friend hanging roof top bar, service very bad. Car park a bit far & complicated. Be careful, Mini bar every item you take out will immediately be chargered to your account. Funny !",102
MBS,2,“For the Rookie International travler or First Time in Asia”,"This place is worse than Vegas. Singapore.. for the better or worse is taking in too many Non Singaporeans and destroying the culture, if there is anything left. What is taking place is worse than what Japan did to Sing a few decades ago...The bath tubs here are PLASTIC, the rooms are dark and kind of dirty. Besides the food curt, is anybody shopping??? No, just like the Siam Paragon in BKK, the stores are too expensive...I paid $2o for a cup of cafe at the hotel lobby, it tasted like Foldgers...Better deals to be found, this is for groups... Not FIT.",296
MBS,2,“There are far better hotels in Singapore”,"Checked into Marina Bay Sands yesterday. Booked 2 room, arrive at 17.30, advised one of the rooms is not ready.... Check in time is 15.00. Took girl at the desk took 20 mins to type in ???? Sloppy, slow check-in. I expect far better from expensive hotels. Rooms are nice, clean, air con a bit noisy. But the main reason I stayed here - as I normally stay at the Hyatt or St Regis in Singapore - is because my family wanted to swim in the Infinity Pool. So last night at around 9.30 we headed upstairs. First, they have this really stupid system where you have a pool card and need to get a wrist band to get into the pool area. I though I was 16 again going to rock concerts or maybe Schoolies Weeks!!! Pretty poor way to control access. We waited in a line for 10 mins to get our wrist band from the security guard. And then the pool itself. Well when I dived in and put on my goggles I was confronted with an array of various bits of rubbish on the bottom of the pool. But when the band aid floated by, I thought enough was enough and got out. Very disappointed with the whole experience. I think MBS are really only interested, like The Sands Group themselves, with high rollers who lose heaps of money in the casino. I should say breakfast is $38++ per head, which is ridiculous, so we decided not to partake. At least Internet and Gym access is include in the room rate. At over $400 per room per night (and we have 2 rooms) , I would hope so. Oh PS: MBS also charge if you want a second bottle of water !!!",64
MBS,3,“Over rated”,"I've stayed in MBS hotel on four different occasions. From the most basic room to their club room, I find their services very inconsistent. The lobby is looking very much like a fish market during check in time. Rooms are okay; clean and tidy. The pool is filled with people all the time. All in all a cool concept to swim on 52nd floor.",332
MBS,2,“Unnecessary hype and over priced for value”,"Stayed there for two nights...the moment i entered hotel lobby it felt like am in crowded bust station people every every where and no one to mange them. after long Que. of checkin got chance to look at hotel un impressive atrium, have seen far better atrium in 5 star hotel around the world then this so called 7 star hotel. Hotel building look like HDB bolck in singapore monotonous look without any character. The room size were big but lack character and a square room with furniture places in it. the furniture looks old with scratches toiletries are ok. the placement of tv in rooms are weird you have to turn your neck (you sure will get neck pain in and hour). The pillow had stain which was unexpected with the hotel of so called 7 star quality. only attraction is swimming pool and the all the hype is build around that, it was very crowded and messy you really can enjoy much though. this is only good part of the hotel. The restaurant at pool level has pathetic service, the staff was expecting us to eat in heavy rain. i ordered food and suddenly rain started the staff was too eager to serve food in rain. they tried to serve same food later after i raised the issue they realised there mistake.The first hotel i have seen which do not value there in house guest, the club at kudeta charges cover to there in house guest which i have not seen in anywhere in my 15 years of travelling. I nutshell if you are willing to pay 400+ for infinity swimming pool there are better hotel in singapore with infinity pool at reasonably ok price (park royal at pickering). The hotel isn't worth the charges and hype it has created. with in similar rate there are hotel 100 times better than Marina Bay Sand. i would not recommend to any of my friend either for business or leisure's in future.",284
MBS,3,“Slow service and costly”,"I must say the stay at mbs was quite a pleasant one. The view is really nice and beautiful. The suite is very spacious. There was a plate of fresh fruits on the dining table and wide variety of TWG tea. However, the food for afternoon tea and cocktail and canape at The club was limited, not much choices to choose from. And when i ordered flavoured vodka, the waiter told me i have to pay for it. Isn't it supposed to be complimentary? I would recommend to go to Rise for lunch as there are more variety of food to choose from but at a higher price. And, most importantly, my friends accidentally broke a cue stick. The stick wasn't of very good quality. I would say i can get it at below $50. However, the management service wants us to pay $85. $85 for an old, secondhand cue stick? Well, it belongs to mbs... Everything is overprice, that's how they make money. Oh, and we reqeusted for a match box 3 times, and it only comes after 45 minutes? It's so slow. My mom complained to me that the bed kind of stinks a little and she can't sleep well... but i had a nice sleep though. Maybe its bacuse of the fact that i have runny nose on that day.Breakfast buffet at Sky on 57, went there for breakfast twice on different dates and they didn't even change the menu... the variety of food available is also the same. We were allowed to order 2 food from the menu each. There's my parents and I, so we ordered 6, and only 3 came. Obviously the waitress weren't paying attention to us...",537
MBS,3,“nice design but...”,"The visual impact of this hotel is spectacular but the overall experience is not enjoyable. Starting at check in, the lobby area has the ambience of a train station, tourists taking photos, guests with wheelie bags everywhere, lines of people waiting for service, a totally hectic atmosphere. The process itself seems to take forever and the rooms weren't available before 3pm. The rooms are an ample size, well equipped and the bathrooms are a nice design. The stone vanity tops and double basins give it high-end feel, walk-in shower and free standing tub (albeit acrylic) also look great. On the ocean view side however there was traffic noise all night. Inside the rooms were clean, unfortunately this didn't extend to the common areas. The top of the balustrading in the corridors around the central void had visible dust which ends up on your hands, the windows at the end of the had dirt on them which appeared to be builders soil, maybe it had been cleaned in the 3 years since constuction? Somone had knocked a trolley or bag into the wall and left plaster on the floor, this was still there 3 days later, as was a plastic wrapper someone had left in the lift lobby. In the same lift lobby (floor 11, tower 2) there were light fittings that weren't properly fitted into open holes in the ceiling, with rough edges and large gaps, looked like a child had tried to fit them and failed, really shabby looking finish. The view from the pool is spectacular, once you get there. If you are on a high floor (above 22) you only need to catch 2 lifts to get to the pool, but from floor 11 and below you need to catch 3, then when you get there you need a pool pass, which allows you a wrist band (just like a hospital or dance party.. depending on your age), with the wrist band installed you are free to search for an empty deck chair, if you're really lucky you might even 2 together, but will likely have families and groups crowded next to you, all trying to share the one chair they could find. The pool is more like soup than water, and a hearty one at that. It's packed with guests all carrying their electronic devices, trying to take photos of themselves and friends with the view in the background, anything but relaxing.The location of this hotel affords it great views from the rooms, but it's not particularly convenient if you want to experience more of what Singapore has to offer, the restaurant choice is limited and they tend to be very expensive or very bad, not much in between. Otherwise its a taxi or MRT to find something else in town. This was my 5th visit to Singapore and i'd been looking forward to staying at the Sands, so was disappointed with the experience. For future trips i'll go back to one of the older hotels near City Hall, they offer better value, greater convenience, with better service and a more relaxing atmosphere. From there you can also get a view of the exterior of the Sands, which is definitely it's best feature.",208
MBS,3,“Great Building and views...average service”,"We arrived with no booking and started to wait in the checkin line that was about 20 people long. I waited about 10 mins before being asked by staff about my reservation. When I said I did not have one, I was ushered into a back room where I was greeted by some more staff and placed with Derrick who took care of my reservation and was up in my 48th floor suite within minutes. (good so far).The orchid suite with city view (and ocean view from bathroom) is excellent in all aspects. The room, the view and facilities (skypool) of the MBS are faultless. Also a positive is the complimentary afternoon tea, and evening drinks as well as the light laser show at 8pm and 9:30pm.The bad: Slow service for breakfast - we had finished our meal before our coffee and juice were served. Our evening room service was slow, when delivered it was cold. After waiting for 45 mins we didnt bother complaining and ate. The result was we got sick which took 2 days to recover. Check out was also terrible with a 15minute wait in line. Also dont expect anyone to help load or unload your bags from the taxi on arrival / departure.",59
MBS,3,“average stay”,They dont give proper check inn time to the tourists. Very inconvenient for the guests specially for different guests coming from other countries.. We stayed for 2 nights and we reach by morning and we get our room at evening. pathetic staff and horrible service. and after staying if we ask for other room. they dont give proper information......,220
MBS,3,“An experience with good and not so good....”,"An impressive building when you first arrive, however you quickly feel as if you are in an airport terminal when you check-in with all the other visitors arriving on the same day. We made a reservation for a Club Room and checked in at Club Room counter which was very busy. We requested a room with two double beds and when we arrived at our room, there was one bed for the four of us. Check-in staff weren't very helpful, we called reception and didn't hear back from them so we went downstairs to speak to the front desk. They advised that our request couldn't be met and only after I explained that we couldn't possibly fit into one bed did they offer to provide a couple of rollaway beds.The bathroom as spacious and the room comfortable and clean. Our view was over Gardens by the Bay (we were on level 46) - very beautiful!The pool was extremely crowded, very difficult to unwind and enjoy the view.Club restaurant had a variety of dishes to choose from and staff were wonderful - very friendly and made everyone feel welcome.Gym was large and faced views of the city.It was an experience staying at this hotel, an impressive building with fantastic views however the service on check-in and check-out was a little lacking.",377
MBS,3,“Service lags the size of the facility”,"The Marina Bay Hotel gives me something of a quandary in this review I have stayed at the hotel on three occasions and the performance has always been consistent, unfortunately the positive attributes can be relied upon but so can the weaker points. The initial appearance is incredibly impressive, the building is stunning and the interior is furnished to a very high standard, the quality and lovely décor extends the bedrooms which really make you feel at home. My issues with the hotel revolve around the fact that, in my view, it is too big for the facilities and level of service expected. The perfect illustration came when my colleagues left the hotel one day before me, they were packed and went to tower one to get a taxi to the airport. The queue for the taxi was around 15-20 people and it was early evening when demand for taxis was strong. The queue was therefore moving very slowly, the problem was that even though the taxis waiting to pick up were coming up really slowly there was a constant stream of taxis dropping people off, but they were not allowed to pick up passengers by the hotel staff. The result was a much longer wait for a taxi than necessary and a high degree of frustration, clearly the staff had rules they religiously had to follow and were not allowed to deviate from them despite the clear evidence that a degree of empowerment was appropriate. It is a similar situation with the restaurants at busy times, such as breakfast, the sheer number of people using the hotel (over 2,500 when it is fully occupied, as it was during my stay) leads to queues and delays, thus on one stay my colleagues queued for 20 minutes to get into breakfast. The overall impression is that the services and facilities do not quite match the size and grandeur of the hotel, the final small quibble is that the hotel is clearly a tourist destination, with the result that the lobby is constantly full of people coming to walk around and view the splendour of the hotel, nothing wrong with that, but it does give you the feeling that you are staying is a very well appointed railway station.",46
MBS,3,“Be ready to be overcharged for everything”,Was there for a conference. The rooms are nice but over priced. The restaurants on the property and the mall are significantly over priced. The pool is great the view of Singapore from the deck is terrific. The conference centre next door is a real walk.,106
MBS,2,“Its getting better”,Last time i stayed at the MBS i truly hated my experience however this time it was bearable. The lobby has been greatly improved with massive plant pots... and service is a little better. I dont understand how the hotel is always full because i am sorry to say this but service is still not up to par based on what they charge. If it wasnt for the gimmick pool or casino i doubt this place would have one customer. Would i recommend this place? Still no. Sorry MBS but please realize people are paying money for a luxury experience not to be meat packed around...,319
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands”,"My husband and I stayed here as he was attending a business show at the conference centre.I was looking forward to staying as I had seen it on a previous visit to Singapore and thought the design amazing. I was however rather disappointed as I felt it was a rather soulless hotel - the room was very large and clean with an amazing view of the marina and surrounding area, the infinity pool was spectacular but the whole place was so busy with visitors rather than just residents it was impersonal and noisy that it was difficult to relax.It was like being in a public swimming pool rather than a pool of a 5 star hotel.Having to wear arm bands to show we were entitled to be there did not impress us!The area between the towers was always crowded and noisy with nowhere to just sit and relax unless you were prepared to pay the high Singapore prices for a drink!I found the shopping area interesting to visit but after 2 visits couldn't find a book shop or anywhere that sold newspapers. We didn't visit the casino but it always seemed busy and perhaps that could account for the high number of visitors walking through the hotel..We did appreciate the MRT station which was attached to the hotel so that we could visit other areas of the city, also the water taxi which has a jetty from the hotel - we took one up the Singapore river and this was most enjoyable and the cheapest thing we found in our visit!!We also visited The Gardens in the Bay which was also interesting but was accessed from outside the hotel so maybe isn't part of it.All in all an interesting experience but if I visit Singapore again I would probably not stay here. We went on to stay in The Capella on Sentosa which was much more pleasant and relaxed.",209
MBS,3,“Very nice hotel..........but”,"Without doubt this is an incredible hotel, but considering how expensive it is 4 things let it down badly. First of all it took an hour, yes an hour, to check in. Of this hour only 15 mins was spent queuing. The other 45 minutes were spent trying to find our rooms. Secondly, on the first night my safe broke, locking all of my docs inside. It took 4 hours to drill the safe open and replace it, not what you want after a 13 hour flight. thirdly, my TV did not work properly all week. I reported it 4 times and each time it was 'fixed' . Indeed the last time it was 'repaired' I left 3 men in my rom 'repairing' it. I gave up after that.........only a small point I know but when you are paying that much for a hotel. Lastly, almost every time I entered the lift I was pestered by families who obviously weren't staying at the hotel but wanted to visit the skypark and wanted to 'borrow' my pass. It was just an annoyance really.The hotel has several fantastic elements. Great staff, the sky park is incredible and the breakfasts are superb, it's just those jiggly things spoiled the stay for me.",176
MBS,3,“Iconic Building- Average experience”,"Liked therooms,bedviews from the pool decklocation and accessibilityDid not like thelong queue at check in and check outfact that room was only available at 5pmlobby area is a through way for general public and very congestedTv only worked after 2 calls to have it fixedcheck in staff forgot to activate the mini barlack of tranquility at the pool deck - far too many people for the spacetoilets, showers and changing areas at the pool area very limited and very dirtySummaryIconic building and certainly a must see world class conceptAs a hotel it will not suit those who want a tranquil luxury experienceThe pool deck although it is a truly clever design with spectacular views - feels like a public facility with far too many people allowed to use the space, and the changing areas are shockingly dirty and unhygienicThe checkin process is not working long lines - in a lobby area that is congested as it is shared with many sight seeing tourists that are not guests of the hotel -leading to a bad first impression",268
MBS,2,“Only the pool is worth it”,"I stayed in this hotel after a few nights at the Shangri La and Swissotel and Marina bay sands just does not compare when it comes to customer service.Given Marina Bay Sands charges 2 to 3 times as much as the other 2, they really offer very little in terms of customer service. The only thing Marina Bay Sands has going for it is their infinity pool, so if you are not planning on spending all your time at the pool, don't waste your money on this hotel.An example of their bad customer service is: the guy at the counter could see i had 3 suitcases at check in, and didn't bother to organise anyone to help take the suitcases up to my room. I had to ask and he said 'yes i can help you if you want?'What kind of question is that at $700 per night??????To top it off, their rooms have airconditioning that can't be changed, and when you call for assistance they tell you to open the window if its too cold. Except there is a highway in front so you get to listen to the lovely highway all night or you freeze.And the best part was their water bottles in the room. They had a note attached saying you will have to purchase more water! Unbelievable.And at check out, there was no one around at the check out counter. And a huge line at the check in counter instead. This hotel only has the pool going for it, they would go out of business if another decent hotel opens with a similar pool.",152
MBS,2,“Not again”,"I was attending a conference at this hotel. I am not usually a BIG hotel person and the two nights at the Marina Bay Sands reminded me why. The lobby is like a shopping mall, trying to fight the crowds to the lift to get to the room was annoying. The rooms themselves were nice and the views excellent, but it was like being on vacation in Disney Land. THe incredibly sky bar and pool have turned it into a tourist destination. The pool was impossible to even get to. There were no seats or pool lounges to sit on, every one taken, the pool was FULL of people ALL day and it was more akin to a public swimming venue than an exclusive hotel. Even when I attend a conference, I like hotels that are welcome retreats from the outside world. This was the world inside the hotel. Not for me.",248
MBS,3,“No Wow Factor”,"Had the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on my list of one of the must visit hotels. I found the photos more impressive than the hotel. Check in took forever, then the type of booked room was not available. Staff are polite, but fail to go just that little bit extra that you expect from a hotel of this standard. We were on 43rd floor with city views which were wonderful. The room was a little larger than the standard but the size was negated by the fact that the sofa had to be made into a bed because the twin bed booked room was not available. The pool is everything you expect, but the gloss is taken off by the volume of people on the paid skypark tours watching you take your swim. Not impressed that to use hair dryer the only option (after finally finding it in wardrobe drawer) was plugging into power point above mini bar and moving peanuts/glasses etc to one side so a portion of a the mirror could be used to see what you were doing. No power point in bathroom seems an amazing oversight. I have been to Singapore several times and there are many hotels that provide the same standard or higher at a far less cost. Save your money and go elsewhere and if the view is a must do for you spend $30 and book a skypark tour or Singapore flyer tour, same view, better value for your money",589
MBS,3,“Poor service ruined our stay”,"We were so excited to stay here, and had booked a high floor, city view room with a double bed.Upon arrival for check-in (half an hour later than check-in opened), we were told the only room available was a 3rd floor(?!?!) room, and if we wanted a higher floor we'd need to wait at least an hour. For a hotel of this caliber I think this is completely unacceptable, especially due to the prices they charge for standard rooms. We waited an hour, came back and were told we'd be staying in a 26th floor, garden view room with two single beds. As aforementioned, we booked a city view room with a double bed. Ridiculous, but at this point we couldn't be bothered to complain. As check-in is at 3pm (and by this time it was 4.30pm) and check-out is at 11am (and we were only staying for one night), we just wanted to relax in our room and enjoy the pool.The room was average, definitely nothing special, and there were no chairs on the balcony. Of all the hotels and apartments I've stayed in I've never stayed anywhere that didn't provide any balcony furniture.As most of the other reviews seem to say, the only truly magnificent thing about this hotel is the pool. It really was spectacular during the evening once it had gone dark. We didn't actually enjoy it during the day, it was far too crowded. The pool staff also need to address the issue of towels and sunbeds. It took us 15 minutes to find a sunbed when we arrived during the afternoon. A large amount of sunbeds had towels on but nobody actually seemed to be using them. We made sure to leave our clothes or something of our own on the sunbeds so it was obvious they were being used. We also saw pool staff remove towels from sunbeds which were actually being used. A system needs to be implemented to address this somehow. Also be aware that the area of the pool nearest to the entrance is adults only. This is not immediately obvious and we saw a number of families find sunbeds there to then be told to move. Also be aware that the floor around the pool is extremely slippery, very hazardous.We much preferred the pool at night when it was quieter. The view was fantastic and the pool was still very warm.We loved the pool but we didn't love anything else. We'll be staying in Singapore a number of times over the next couple of years and will not be returning. Everybody we know who has stayed here (we have family in Singapore) says the same thing: it's great to stay for a night and experience the pool, but if you want decent rooms and service, go elsewhere.After reading the reviews myself, it is evident that Marina Bay Sands has suffered with these same issues for a long time, yet the management seem to be doing absolutely nothing to improve the terrible check-in service. I'll be polite enough not to name the man who checked us in, but he was very rude and came across almost snobbish. It's simply not necessary in a hotel that could be fantastic.In the long run, Marina Bay Sands will suffer unless these issues are addressed properly (not just via damage control on tripadvisor). There's no room for complacency - in time people will realise Marina Bay Sands isn't worth the poor service and inflated prices just for the sake of the Sky Park.",247
MBS,3,"“Hotel itself is very average, Skypark and infinity pool are incredible however.”","After requesting a city view as high as possible with a double bed when booking a one-night stay months before, we turned up to check in on the day to be told we had a third floor room (which would be facing the shopping centre with no view at all). We were then told we could wait one hour and would get a slightly higher room, so we agreed, only to be told we could have a 10th story room or a room above the 20th floor but only with two single beds. Regardless to say the member of staff checking us in took an age to do so and was very rude and arrogant about it. However we came back an hour later and checked into a 22nd floor room which was in fact facing the bay. So our requested high floor city-view double room was in fact a low floor bay-view with two single beds which we had to wait 1 hour longer for. The room was good but not amazing and for some reason we had a balcony but no chairs to take out to sit on, only the oversized armchairs included in the room. However the Skypark was its saving grace and was very impressive, especially at night, and my separate review of that got five stars. I would not recommend staying here for a holiday though, maybe for one or two nights to experience the infinity pool but that would be it.",157
MBS,3,“Could be better”,"Stayed at MBS on my recent business trip. Great location and spacious room. Amazing view overlooking the Singapore skyline from the room and cool infirnity pool.However, I would expect a little bit more personal touch on the room service and amenities with this sort of room rate. Like a turn down service with a piece of chocolate wishing you a good night and sweet dream, good quality toilettry like from L'ocittatane and etc. You could find these sorts of personal touches with the international 5 stars hotel like Shangri-la and Langham. They need to provide a super king size bed, not a king bed. All hotels provide a super king size bed now. The room decor was simple, doesn't provide a luxuries touch in it. We didn't try the breakfast. Overall, it is a good and enjoyable experience. But it could be better. It wasn't up to my expectation of being to most wonderful hotel in Singapore.",357
MBS,2,“A bit of a letdown”,"The biggest letdown of this hotel is the grandeur it exudes from the exterior. Due to the size and the engineering feat of this hotel, many people are attracted to the hotel. As such, the hotel felt extremely crowded at the lobby area and also noisy.There are too much activities going on around there.I did an online registration (for check-in) however I never received any confirmation and I had to go through the usual check-in process at the reception. For a 5* hotel with that sort of price, I expect more of the room. It isn't any much different (and in fact may not be as good) as other 5* hotels in Singapore. The duvet is rather thin - granted this is a tropical country, however I do like my duvets thick and we do have air conditioning. Amenities is sufficient and Wi-Fi connection is decent. The famed infinity pool is really just a place to be seen/take photos. There are so many people lounging at the pool area that you can't really swim else you risk splashing on the sun bathers. I would have to honestly say that the views are nice from the top. They really messed up my payment and I had to call them from my home country 4 times to have it rectified. First time I called, I was passed to another department and nobody picked the phone up and the call ended.2nd and 3rd time, I was told someone will call me back within the same day however none did even after I waited for 48 hours. The issue was only finally resolved on my 4th call when I insisted that the matter is resolved while I was on the phone. Breakfast is great. There are various restaurants that we can go for breakfast depending on the heart's desire. Would I stay here again?No. I've had the picture taken of me in the pool and can claim that I have stayed at MBS, which is what a lot of people actually did. It is too hyped up. I'd pay much less for a cosier stay in other 5* hotels in Singapore.",326
MBS,3,“Better hotels in Singapore.”,"Check in was a bit crazy. Not enough staff were on the reception and concierge desks. The lobby is very large and somewhat impersonal, much like the entire MBS experience. We booked a room with a bath, the room was nice but lacked wow factor. The staff on check in mentioned my husbands birthday and sent a cake to our room which was a nice gesture. The bed was too stiff for my liking. Toiletries are generic and not appealing. Our room keys failed to work after one use which was annoying. If you come to Singapore to shop, the MRT will be the best way to get around, the Bayview station under MBS is not well placed for easy quick travel as it is on a \looped\"" line in one direction only. All of the shops at the MBS shopping centre are expensive, I figure the rent would be expensive and they have a captive audience!The lifts are split for floors under and over 22. If your room is under floor 22 like ours was, you'll need to change lifts twice to gain access to the pool. Given a wrist band to get into the pool area, by this stage I was already thinking why bother! Such a process just for a swim. Get to the roof pool finally to a scene of chaos. There was a sense of every man woman and child for themselves, the rudeness was unbelievable from some of the guests! No chairs available, ever. Pool was murky and did not look too inviting anyway. Disappointing.As we were leaving our room, the smell was unbearable. Someone had peed in a bin and on the floor near the lift.Don't bother. There are much better hotels in Singapore.My husband & I stayed at the Fairmont for 3 nights prior, MBS was supposed to be a \""splurge\"" for his birthday. We could not help but compare, the Fairmont service and rooms were far superior.""",224
MBS,2,“Bad customer Service”,Had visited Marina Bay Sands in May 2013.Was super excited to stay in extremely hyped hotel. My disappointment started itself while reservations.We had booked this hotel online and they charged 94 dollars extra in our card.It was a Mistake by their staff.When called several times no response.We were hassled for almost two weeks.Finally they reverted saying that its a mistake from our side will upgrade u to premium city room which was just just merely difference of 20 dollars.I had already booked premium room and payed 528 dollars .so will not bother about the diff of 20 dollars.There was no apologies even when we checked in the hotel. Infact the staff who checked us in was extremely rude and she even forgot to give us our room keys .We dint realized unless we started searching for it.Once again we had to stand in a huge line to get our room keys and once again no apologies.My story cant stop here coz I had terrible experieneces in this hotel later as well.Purely related to customer service.People who do not bother about service can check in to this hotel.I suggest the management that they better start working on their customer service.Location of this hotel is mind blowing and I suggest to take premium city view room if at all anyone planning to stay in this hotel.,477
MBS,2,“Beef up on the service”,"The staycation at Marina Bay Sands turns out to be a huge disappointment given that I'm Singaporean and everything about Marina Bay Sands was very much hyped up and in most cases, marketed to be one of the Landmark in Singapore. Check in time was 3pm and at 4pm - There was no rooms ready. What's appalling is that, despite the registered guest made known during the first check in that he would have guest in the room and that it will be okay for his guest to get the keys to the room when the room is finally ready - The first front desk staff apparently did not register the that portion and strangely landed us in a state of baffled when we tried to check in again at 5pm. The room that was given to us was \taken\"". The first front desk staff could only sheepishly smile at her colleague. No apologies or even acknowledgement for her mistake. Sun, the second staff who served us finally managed to checked us in and took her initiative to explain the situation and we are thankful for. And, the first front desk staff advised that it will be fine for us to proceed to the skypark without the room key which was obviously not the case because we couldn't even get to 57th level without inserting the keycard in the lift. I mean, its okay to not go to the skypark prior but please, get your facts right as a service provider instead of allowing guest to ask every staff available on what to do. That aside, the pool is amazing along with the view. Towels by the pool are warm. The bell hop who carried out luggage into the room is warm and friendly. That would make up for the lack of service until we finally checked out where a pair of glasses was left behind the room by the bathroom sink. We checked out at 1pm and the lost and found call was made at 2pm. I was almost certain that this wouldnt possibly pose as a problem for any hotel to safekeep a pair of glasses left behind. No follow up was done so i called again at 5.30pm with a reply that they needed \""a few hours\"" to get back and i did so again at 9pm with MBS not finding my pair of glasses and how anything that is not in the bin are not regarded as rubbish to be thrown away. But why is that my pair of glasses that is left by the sink, lost? All in all, the service is impersonal and inefficient on the whole despite the fact that it is one of the most prominent landmark in Singapore and because it is a hotel - A touch of personal service and better training of staff would be perfect.""",292
MBS,2,“Stayed in better 2 star hotels”,broke our trip from pennang to australia with a one night stay [we are glad only one night ] from the moment you step in you are put in queues the most important thing about you is your credit cards number check in time is 3pm check out 11am so after a 35 min wait to check in we were told to come back [ if you have anything in your suite case you need forget it it as been taken off you before you get in and a ticket given . they will give you a pass to go to the sky pool [ to bad if your swimwear is in your case ] some tower lifts only go so far then you get out and find the next one every time you are in the lift you insert a card and press the floor you want some people did not get this or not shown . Breakfast time we were early by 15 mins and told to come back I asked for a cup of tea and was shown another area were they wanted $12 AUS You get served breakfast in the same area that you wait for booking in its like a train station. The room is average the view ok I will not recommend it to my friends and have the pics to show . The casino is crowed with smokers no seat unless spending money warm soft drink is for free as well as water. Not a beer could be had in the place. There responce will be we are looking into all of this and fine tuning everything [ good spin doctor ] LOW STANDERD PLACE WITH HIGH PRICE TAG [PAUL STAYED 17 JUNE 2013 ],208
MBS,1,“5 star hotel without 5 star service!”,"Marina Bay Sands really disappoint me big time! Went there twice and the experience was not good at all. Recently, the valet parking at Marina Bay Sands damaged my sun shade which was bought in Japan recently and did not even own up till I discovered it when i receive the car. The driver dishonestly just slip the sunshade back to pretend that it was not damaged. Such dishonest act by a 5 star hotel! Later they investigated and the driver admitted he damaged it. It troubled me to have to go to a workshop to take out the stud which was trapped in the door by the act of the irresponsible driver. The manager of the valet parking promised a call back but till now, it has been more than a week and there was no call from that so called manager! Can't imagine MBS to be so irresponsible and there is no good customer experience. If you are lucky, you will be fine. If you are so unlucky like me which MBS gave bad experience and just did not bother to resolve customer's issue, that's what you will get for paying to stay over there and having to endure all these stupid, irresponsible actions from them!",224
MBS,3,“Sky deck a public space?”,"We stayed at MBS for three nights in two rooms. Lovely room with views of gardens and bay. Wonderful architecturally with pool at skydeck, but some frustrations. When I booked I had no idea I would be wristbanded to use the sky deck facilities and pool, along with all the others up there who did not appear to be hotel guests. Crowded and noisy, with no area set aside exclusive to guests. Like going to the public pool. The hotel promotes the pool as its key selling point, and you do assume it is exclusive to guests of the hotel. And downstairs, the same! The lobby is like a shopping mall on Xmas Eve. Tourists, who are not guests, are filing through continuously. It is very noisy and impersonal. You soon realise there are actually NO areas for hotel guests to enjoy, except for your actual room. I must admit I was quite disappointed with the overall atmosphere. Based on the advertising, I feel the hotel has misrepresented its guest factions and services. Dining was average and very expensive. Hotel staff were courteous, but restaurant service was inconsistent and sometimes very slow. This is such a large hotel, I guess it will always feel crowded, but as a thoroughfare for everyone visiting Singapore, it is not the place for a special or intimate holiday!",165
MBS,3,“Crowded”,"The hotel is impressive and huge, really huge. So huge that you need to walk a long long distance for breakfast and front desk. This is compensated by the fascinating views all around. Since it is a large hotel spread over several towers, there are instances when you do not get the attention you would expect in a five star hotel. Amenities in the room are quite basic. Unfortunately for me, there was also a half eaten dumpling left in the minibar that was not cleared for both the days I stayed there. Breakfast was sumptuous and you have an option to go for the Asian one if you do not want the international one. Access to the train station, shopping complex and exhibition hall is convenient although you need to allow for enough time due to the distance. It was good that the hotel required identification to enter the pool area as many tourists tend to visit that area to catch the panoramic view.",90
MBS,3,"“For the Price, Disappointing”","Daughter and I visiting Singapore together. We booked an upgraded room with city view. When I e-mailed the hotel to request that we have a room with 2 separate beds, I was told that they could not guarantee that request, and they'd have to see what was available when we arrived. So when we arrived, we were given an upgraded, city view room, but with 1 king bed. This is a 5-star hotel, and we were paying $540 per night. I should not have to worry about the sleeping arrangements.",113
MBS,2,“Stay here to use the pool only”,The hotel is over priced at $400 AUD a night. No service is on offer with huge line for check in and out.The rooms are okay but nothing to rave about. We had issues with sleep due to the noise coming from the highway located next to the rooms. The hotel lobby is like a tourist attraction with hundreds of people hanging around.The only thing the hotel has to offer is the swimming pool and view which was fantastic but the drink are overpriced paying $13 Aud for a middy of beer and $16 for a cocktail.Dont expect much from this place except a view and a pool. We would not stay again,146
MBS,2,“Iranians are not allowed in the casino!”,"My wife and I got married in Singapore and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. We were having an incredible time until we decided to go to the casino. My wife is Iranian and because of this she was not allowed to enter the casino. This was humiliating for her as we were both pulled out of the line to be questioned by the security staff. The casino could not give us a definitive answer as to why she wasn't allowed in the casino, other than this was company policy! After complaining and going through various levels of management, my wife and I were given transportation by limo to the other casino in Singapore and was allowed in immediately, a small consolation for inexcusable behaviour. This kind of behaviour from a casino/hotel like this was totally unacceptable. This incident ruined our first day of marriage.",288
MBS,1,"“Don't stay there, just enjoy the view from a distance...”","First impression is quite the same if you would arrive to huge airport. Big lobby doesn’t make you feel comfortable and welcoming at all, but it’s a must for a such a huge venue, of course. Sound of crowd is so consistent and loud that I could not hear any music from the welcoming quintet playing violins and harp at the lobby.You will probably have to queue to check-in and check-out. It took me about 20 minutes to check-in. On check-out billing system of hotel goes down, so everyone had to wait for 10 minutes system to be fixed. Total I wasted 35 minutes on check-out.Room was very spacious, but furniture was unbelievably cheap and ugly. It is made from low-density wood chipboard. Door on wardrobe was broken and did not close properly. Sofa looks like it was taken from a motel.View was magnificent but balcony was full of dust. Bathroom was good but amenities were scanty. Shaving kit looked like it was used before. Razors looked damaged.The most important part of staying with Marina Bay Sands is surely an access to a swimming pool. View was fantastic, indeed. But pool was very small and overcrowded. So don’t expect any relaxation and nearly clean water even in “no children” area. Marina Bay Sands is a venue pretending to be a five stars, but It’s nothing but a “mass-serving” venue, very far away from any hospitality standards. Main auditory of it is curious and undemanding customers. This hotel is something like McDonald’s pretending it is a venue for gourmets… Don’t waste your money and just stay in any other hotel opposite to Marina Bay Sands. Building’s appearance from a big distance is the only good thing about this venue.",197
MBS,3,"“holiday with 10,000 of your closest friends!!”","This hotel looks amazing from the outside, and my next trip to Singapore that is where I will view it from!! We arrived about 1.30am and checked in. we had prepaid about 2 months in advance. We were shown to a room on the second floor, about 10 metres from the freeway, but it sounded as if we were right in the middle of the freeway. It took some time, but we were moved to a 23rd floor room. Not impressed at the fact they had better rooms but dumped us in the crappy one. The hotel was so busy it is ridiculous, they just can't cope!! The crowds to do anything are nuts. The check in and check out lines are huge. The roof top pool is fantastic, but unless you go at 6.00am, you just can't move!! Although breakfast was included in our rate, we still had to argue at checkout as we were charged for breakfast. Singapore was fantastic, and will come back again, but will not stay here again. Singapore has lots of great places to stay, but I was lured by the pool, which in the end, I could not even use.",71
MBS,1,“service is appaling”,Went to check into grand club rooms over 700 a night check in was meant to be 3 one room was ready at three the rest not ready until later the last one at 6 the vip check in was a queue for at least half an hour very bad service and very bad attitude I have stayed at far cheaper hotels with much better service will never stay there again,187
MBS,3,“Fabulous View but more like a tourist attraction”,"Worst booking in experience we have ever experienced. We had booked a Club room, upon arriving we're not directed to the correct booking in area. Service left a lot to be desired especially after coming from The St Regis Singapore. This hotel looks so spectacular, maybe we expected so much but we found the Lobby very bland, terribly crowded with long, slow booking in que. we then had to find our own way to our room. There were no friendly 'welcome' faces, we were just lost in the crowd. Our Club room with city views was lovely, large, beautiful bathroom overlooking the Gardens By The Bay, especially nice to see with the night lights, absolutely worth a long visit. easy to walk to. All the extra inclusions with the Club room are worth it. On the brochures the poolside and relaxed balcony setting for drinks and nibbles look so different as when you are the it is all SO crowded. No privacy at all. Infinity pool was something different. Took our photo's, glad we stayed a few nights but won't go again as to 'touristry' for us.",330
MBS,3,“Not my Favorite Hotel in Singapore”,"If staying at a 2400 room hotel is appealing to you, or if you are going to stay at MBS for a conference or convention read on. Otherwise, there are plenty of better hotel options in Singapore.From the outside (especially from your airplane window) MBS is truly iconic even more so at night with the light/laser/water show. From the inside though, things are different. First. the service is \ok\"" and this is in MBS's defense widespread in Singapore. However, if you have the misfortune to arrive early in the morning as I did (around 6am) be forewarned as the \""C\"" team is on duty at check-in/check-out. It took 20 minutes to check-in and I was the second person in line! And, if there is a problem, there is no one at the concierge desk until 10am.The lobby for MBS is long and massive, cold and sterile. It reminds me of being in an airport terminal, and as a result the handful of restaurants and bars also have a plastic, unwelcome feel to them. At times, it feels as crowded as an airport terminal or train station too. Fortunately, the hotel is connected to a high end mall with more restaurants and bars and a very good food court.My room however was nice, spacious with glorious views of the city skyline.The gym is large and with a good selection of equipment, but in the morning it can get very crowded. It is large but not large enough for peak demand from 2,400 rooms.The rooftop pool is spectacular, but it is not really set-up for swimming laps. My other big disappointment is that there is no food and beverage service on the roof top unless you are \""club level\"" which allows you entrance into a large 200+ seat lounge. No one could ever tell me how to qualify for \""club level\"" though.MBS is connected to the subway, and there is also a water taxi to take one across the bay for S$4.""",236
MBS,3,"“Over rated hotel. Other than the pool, there's nothing much to write home about the hotel”","I really do not understand why people rate this hotel at very high score. The pool is certainly lovely and wonderful but that is the best part of it. I knew it would not be a great service hotel before I arrived as I had very unpleasant experience before I checked it. I came for business and ask for 3 rooms at same floor. I've got a auto response that they would get back to me without 24 hours. One day gone, 48 hours gone and 72 hours gone and still no reply. I resend the email again and the reply is 'everything is subject to availability'. There is no apology why they did not reply earlier and the response is so blunt, certainly should not be something from a five star hotel. I found this totally unacceptable as it is not a 10 rooms budget hotel but a five stars hotel with more than 2000 rooms and wrote to them a month ago.Check in was slow and a bit chaotic. You felt like you are lining up for a train ticket rather than checking in hotel. The check in process is very slow and under staffed. There was 3 people ahead of me and it took me more than 15 minutes to check as they only had 2 staffs on duty.Overall, if it is not for the conference I would not stay at this hotel.",114
MBS,2,“Disappointing!”,"We booked a larger Non Smoking room which comes with a sofa bed. The room was not ready till after 6pm. When we got to the room it reeked of smoke and the sofa was badly stained. We called housekeeping but the hotel was full so they sent a ionizer device and a lady came with a spray bottle to spray the room and take away the smoke smell. This helped for maybe am hour! The next morning sunlight poured in from the left side of the night curtain as they had been cut too short. Compared to the other hotels we've stayed at in Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands is a let down.",182
MBS,2,“Great hotel-terrible check-out”,"The hotel was great. Great pool and gym, great room and view and close to shopping and food. But I was very dissapointed the day after I had checked out. My journey continued to Kuala Lumpur and when I was gonna check in, there wasn´t enough balance on my card...I checked with my bank and Marina Bay Sands had debited me twice!!! First I e-mailed the hotel and after 30 hrs (mind they have a 24 hr policy) with no reply I decided to call them. I got to speak to a woman at accounting and she told me that they hadn´t released their initial debit post on my card plus they had debited me for my stay. She said that it could be up to 10 bank days before the problem was resolved. I wasn´t pleased to hear this since Marina is not a cheap hotel and I was without a lot of money. I´m very dissapointed that I didn´t recieve an apologie for my inconvinience PLUS that if I hadn´t checked my balance the problem would not have been noticed.",201
MBS,2,“Big definitely does not mean good”,"We were hesitant to stay at the Sands hotel, knowing that service would suffer given such a large hotel, but still didn't imagine how bad it would be until we experienced it. Got here by taxi early in the morning with 3 big pieces of luggage and not a bellboy in sight. We were told the check-in queue was atrocious so decided to check-in early. Even at 6 in the morning we had to wait 30 min before we got to the counter. The reception staff were slow and dour - they must really hate their job! The frustrating part was that they made us line up again when we picked up the room keys later that day. You just don't get the feeling that the staff are sincerely wanting to serve you. More like they're just doing their job. Just no comparison to a real five-star hotel. I guess Sands can always use the excuse that they have to service so many guests everyday.... I guess.To be fair, the hotel is THE place to be and be seen. And the rooftop pool is a THE place to spend a hot sunny afternoon in Singapore. Just be prepared for 3-star service.",177
MBS,2,"“Bad customer service, smell in toilet”","My family and I had a stayed at MBS recently. We looked forward to the stay but it turned out very disappointing. Compared to customer service at Fullerton, Four seasons, Shangri-La, Capella and even Marina Mandarin, your customer service is lousy. No smiles at all for your front desk staff, although we were smiling all the way, trying to encourage you guys to smile. We thought it was only one staff, but it turned out that 99% of your staff can't smile. And the check in was terribly slow and inefficient.When we entered our room, the stench from the toilet was alarming. Not strong but definitely not expected for a 5* hotel. The toilet bowl also had urine stains. The view that the hotel and pool offers is spectacular and breathtaking but the bad service really puts people off. Unlikely to return for another stay unless we can't help it.Worse still, your website does not lead us to a link to feedback you directly, so we have no choice but to post this where everybody can see.",130
MBS,3,“Typical too big hotel”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands from May 12 - 17, 2013 on the 36th floor and nothing really stood out but the view. This was my first trip to Singapore for work and the Marina Bay was recommended by a colleague. The staff was helpful and always courteous, WIFI was free which was a bonus but other than that this was your typical huge hotel where you were one of the masses. Visited the Rise lounge and the breakfast buffet which were overpriced. Overall if you are looking for a casino hotel and high end shopping mall this is your hotel. If you want to save some money and experience more of the city stay in town. My next stay in Singapore won't be at the Marina Bay.",152
MBS,3,"“Loved my first stay, 2nd stay was just blah.”","Ok, yes, this place is beautiful and an Architectural and Engineering Marvel and the view from the pool deck at night is fantastic-on my first visit back in April of 2012,I was in awe. But for some reason, having stayed here once seems to be have been enough. The second time I stayed here seemed like such a great waste of hard earned money. I've been reading reviews from others and I just want to attest to the fact that the loooong check-in queues drain your patience upon arrival. When you're tired and just want to lie on your bed, well hope and pray that so many people are not hoping and praying to do the same. It's quite nice and all, but you'll get better service elsewhere. So, if the question is would I go back? Yes, if somebody sponsors it, otherwise, I would never spend another penny on this hotel.",92
MBS,3,“Average Casino”,"We took the MRT Promenade (CC4) exit then interchanged at platform B then exit at Bayfront for Marina Bay Sands Casino. Upon exit turn left, there is immediately an entrance way to the Casino. The casino is typical or averaged Casino. They don't even have complimentary or tokens for the members just discount unlike other big time casinos at Macau. Well i guess it's because they don't need to beat other Casinos within the area. Bad customer-service from the entrance, reception area of members and even at the restaurants in the casino.",177
MBS,3,"“Impressive compex, but not that great”",Stayed at the Sands for 3 nights in the Club room. Got in on a Saturday night only to have to carry my own bags to reception. It was busy and people every where very overwhelming especially after a long flight. Went to the VIP reception was greated quickly and went to our room. We had booked for three people and had to arrange for an extra bed to be put in although this ws booked. Breakfast on the 57 floor was very good and having booked the club room we were able to utilize the preveliges and make sure you do cause the room is expensive. The pool is crowed and although impressive didn't even go for a swim it was just to crowed and you could not relax. Been to Singapore several times and stayed at the Pan Pacific - Marina Bay. I left this hotel wishing that I had booked the Pan Pacific. By they way bagagge people need some efficiency waiting a very long time 10-15 minutes for the collected from baggage hold.,606
MBS,3,“Casino and Conference Centre Dormitory”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Hotel twice in 2 weeks when attending different conferences and both visits left me less than enamoured. My first booking was direct with the hotel, and the confirmation I received told me to enjoy the free shuttle bus from the airport. When I arrived at the airport, I found a deserted/abandoned MBS desk and after about 20 minutes following spurious directions from various helpful but uninformed people, I found out that the shuttle bus had been stopped a few weeks before. So I got a taxi. What a waste of time! When I got to the hotel, I had to open my own taxi door and had my luggage half out of the boot before I got any assistance. I know I sound spoilt, but isn’t that the point of a 5* Hotel?? Next disappointment was the queues 4 deep at the huge reception desk – dozens of people waiting to check in. I was actually pointed to the other check-in desk at the other end of the hotel (it’s huge!) and there was no one to help with the luggage. The lobby also smelled very strongly of cleaning fluid at different times on both visits – strong enough to catch the back of your throat – which was very unpleasant. And the lobby is often so busy that it’s like fighting your way through a crowded shopping mall on a Saturday afternoon.One good point is that when I did complain at check-in that there was no shuttle bus from the airport (but it was mentioned in my booking confirmation), I was immediately refunded my taxi-fare. So keep your receipt! <U+F04A>My rooms were on the 8th and then 11th floors on respective visits. The rooms are modern, spacious and well-appointed and the free wifi is good, but both looked on to the main highway, and both suffered from incessant traffic noise – all day and all night. The 8th floor room in Tower 2 (857 for reference) also allowed me to enjoy the singer in the lobby bar – whether I wanted to or not. Avoid low floors, especially in Tower 2.The pool on the roof is probably the main reason (apart from the casino or conference centre) anyone would stay at the MBS, and it is spectacular. And busy right up to late at night.On the plus side, when my doorbell wasn’t working – it rang itself at random when no one was outside – the engineering staff fixed it very quickly. And all the staff individually are friendly and helpful. I think that there’s just not enough of them to provide 5* service in such a massive complex. When I called to get my bag collected from my room on check-out, I waited 10 minutes for someone to come before giving up and taking my own bag down. The scale of the building means that the staff you want may be a long, long way away, and that just doesn’t make you feel like you’re getting the level of service you’re paying for. And that brings me to the main issue – the price. The special conference rate I got ended up being S$420 (£220) per night for room only! That’s a whole lot of money for a hotel where you take your own luggage up to your room. There are lots of hotels in Singapore that are much cheaper and provide much better service – maybe not the bling, but proper 5-star feel-good service… Given the choice, my money would be spent in the Mandarin Oriental, Conrad, Marina Mandarin, Shangri La or the Ritz Carlton…",100
MBS,3,“Does not rate well”,"Business trip for my husband, pleasure for me. It is far away from things and food is limited to food court, buffets and a few expensive restaurants that were nice for dinner, but not for a quick bite for lunch. The service is VERY slow and the Sweet Spot got my order wrong 3 days in a row. Saying I'm sorry 20 times does not help, just get it right- order was black coffee and coffee with milk!There are a few things that are special for a minute, pool, Garden on the bay, but not worth a visit ever again.",834
MBS,2,“Poor Service”,"I have stayed here multiple on multiple occasions and on dozens of nights whilst on business in Singapore, usually because it is one of my company's approved hotels.Visually, the hotel and surrounds are obviously stunning and a very impressive piece of architecture. The view from the roof is perhaps one of the best in Singapore. Location wise it is also quite good, easy walk to the mall and casino across the street (through an under-street passageway) and there is a good selection of shops and restaurants in the mall itself, both at a luxury and normal level. The Gardens By The Bay are also easily accessed directly from the hotel by a connecting bridge. To go anywhere else in Singapore you would need a taxi, usually readily available, or grab the MRT from the mall.Unfortunately that is all that is commendable about this hotel. I think there is a lot of initial wow factor that may satisfy people staying for a couple of days on a weekend break but the service doesn't generally back that up.Repeatedly, and I'm not exaggerating here, the check-in experience is by far the worst I have experienced anywhere in the world. A wait of 20-45 minutes is not uncommon, and that is when the hotel is not particularly busy. Also, twice I have arrived at midnight from a flight from Australia to be told my room isn't ready. I've also experienced going to the room and then having another guest arrive a couple of minutes later, who has been booked into the same room. You will often see more staff behind the counter than there are customers - I really am not sure what they are doing and the whole process of checkin and checkout at this hotel is a painful experience. I don't even bother to wait in the check-out line anymore, I just submit the quick check-out form. However they never get this right either so I have to call them to get the invoice a couple of weeks later. I don't find the staff particularly friendly either, they seem a bit arrogant at times, particularly if you question them or the booking, or when something goes wrong. On more than one occasion I have had to extend my booking only to be told the hotel is completely sold out, yet I have then booked a room online right in front of them. Appreciate their system may not show availability, but there is a disconnect there and it is frustrating as a guest that extending a stay is not a simple process.There does not appear to be any customer loyalty programme for frequent guests, apart from the casino programme. So you are not rewarded for staying here as a guest, or more importantly things like an express check-in like most other hotels would have.The rooms themselves are at an ok standard. The colour scheme is quite light and they seem to show dirt quite easily, some are looking quite worn/grubby already with carpet stains etc. However they are cleaned very well each day and the housekeeping staff do a very good job. The rooms are generally large, as are the bathrooms and most have good views. On the gardens side there can be a lot of noise from the freeway, especially on the lower level floors. The view is excellent from both sides of the hotel, especially now that the Gardens By The Bay are finished. The air-con and internet are both very good. Beds are ok, the linen seems a but 'hard' , not up to the same standards as some of the other 5 star hotels in Singapore. (Though not sure MBS is 5 star)The food and beverage at the hotel is all excellent from what I have tried. The room service quality is very good. As is the breakfast buffet. Excellent food selection, although the prices are not so cheap. Ku De Ta on the roof is also a nice place for a drink, though the prices are expensive ($30 for a mojito) and there should not be a cover charge for hotel guests. (Spend several thousand dollars at your hotel per stay but you've got to pay $38 cover just like a member of the public)The gym facilities are excellent, probably the best I've seen. The swimming pool again is visually stunning, but not so classy and can get very busy. And I'm not sure why more than a few guests feel it necessary to wander around the hotel in speedos and bathrobes.Overall I think this place is just too large and too busy to ever experience any good personal service. And the focus is obviously on the casino and it's guests rather than the business traveller market. Stay here for a weekend and it it could be a fantastic experience, stay here multiple times a year for weeks at a time and it is not so great. All fur coat and no knickers would be the best phrase to describe this hotel.",365
MBS,3,“Lots of glitz but lacking soul”,"Spent 2 nights here at Easter and came away with mixed feelings. The big positive is the pool which is spectacular with a view to match although nobody swims, just hangs out along the edge. The breakfast at Sky on 57 was excellent - lots of choice, great service and outlook.The let down is the impersonal feel of the hotel generally and an apparent lack of trust - the property is just too big to generate any sense of belonging. We were challenged for ID regularly, even just going from breakfast on the roof back to our room. Disturb anything in the mini bar and sensors generate a charge on your bill a minute or two latter. Getting charges reversed involves waiting for a staff member to come and check that the mini bar is in fact intact.Check in at 10pm after a long flight involved standing around forever waiting for a receptionist then another 20 minutes as they typed war and peace into the computer then being presented with pages of terms and conditions on a screen and being asked to sign it then walking the length of the lobby area to find your elevator. All a bit tiresome. The lobby area is spectacular & vast but on the third or fouth traverse it feels a bit like an airport terminal.The room itself (a city view room but facing the harbour which I didn't mind - city view refers to height in the hotel) was clean, already looking a bit worn but comfortable. Not as big as expected from a Singapore 5 star hotel. The only real gripe was a rattling airconditioner fan. Not enough to bother with but meant turning it to minimum to sleep.Check out was mercifully quick, youv'e paid?, bye-bye...Proximity to Shoppes with its shops, gallery, cafes and restaurants is a bonus. Casino adjoins if that is your thing. Trip to town and other attractions is simple either by MRT or Taxi. Gardens by the Bay is also on 10 minutes walk away and well worth a visit.We left thinking glad we'd stayed but probably wouldn't stay here again - other properties in Singapore deliver a friendlier and more personal experience.",128
MBS,1,“Bad service for a luxurious hotel”,"one, i request earlier checking thru booking.com since we flew 10 hours direct from auckland . but the front office told room was not ready and checking time 3 pm. they even dont have emphaty for my mom who were in wheelchair exhausted after longhaul flight. the reason was to good to be true they told all room all still occupied since its 8.30 am. which for me not made any sense . and in return they offered a refreshing room which share with others that i believe had same experiences with us. the room was small and full of people even they sat on the floor. very uncomfortable! i surely will never stay at marina bay sands again. it looks good outside but not inside. sorry .",263
MBS,3,“Worth it ... For the pool!”,"My husband organized a room for a girls' night for myself, a friend and our daughters. The valet was less than impressive, as was the lobby. Check-in was smooth and fast. The hallways to our room were very basic and not that clean. Our room was fairly basic, but very comfortable. We asked for 2 beds which we pushed together and made one big bed for the sleep over - that was fun. The rooms were very sound proof, we could not hear a thing from outside or in the hallway. A couple of minor negatives I found was that the hair dryer was similar to one you would find in a budget motel and the light switches for the bathroom were located at the entry of the room. I also found that many of the hotel staff didn't know much about the hotel, particularly how to get to the sky deck from our room on level 16, or where to fond the entrance to the Shoppes. Speaking of which, the Shoppes were amazing, anything you could ever need can be found here - and for any budget! The sky deck is amazing and swimming up to the edge of the infinity pool is pretty awesome! I liked the fact that our kids felt welcome and there was an adults only section for those who didn't want to be bothered by kids.All in all, it was a nice experience, the pool and sky deck were definitely highlights! I doubt we'll stay again as I did not think it was good value for money.",109
MBS,2,“Absolutely disappointing!”,"My friend, her cousin and dentist friend was greeted at the reception poorly, the area was like an airport terminal, people everywhere! The service was poor. Took ages to get into the room.When settled in, they wanted the room to be made and asked for it digically not like hanging a card outside the door. When they returned, the room wasn't made up!The dining room had poor service. The water in the pool on the roof was filthy! Rashes developed on two of the friends.I was going to stay at this hotel in May 2013 but declined after my friends told me the $600+ per night wasn't worth it!",635
MBS,3,“Overrated???”,"My 2 daughters and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights during our recent trip to Singapore. The hotel looks impressive from the outside. Checking in was quick, however, the person who assisted me at the check in counter forgot to give me my room key. I thought she had inserted it inside the little booklet she gave me but she didn't and we didn't realise it until we reached our room on the 52nd Floor. The room was huge with a king size bed and a sofa. I didn't realise that the sofa was a pull out sofa bed which we could have used. No one pointed this out to us and I didn't notice it until just before we left the room to check out.Although the room was big, it was very stuffy - which i immediately noticed since I entered the room for the very first time. I thought we were booked in a smoking room - as I am quite sensitive to cigarette smell and other strong smelling stuff, but after further checking it was established that the whole floor was a non smoking room so our room couldn't have been a smoking room. I can honestly say that if we didn't set out and left our room everyday to do shopping and sightseeing, then I don't think I'd been able to stay in our room for longer than 4 hours without feeling breathless. It was like being in a really dusty room - the smell and stuffiness.Another negative comment...the toilettries and complimentary water bottles were not automatically replenished everyday, unlike in other hotels where I've stayed in the past (which I must add, cost far less than the Marina Bay Sands). One day, the housekeeper cleaned our room whilst we were still having breakfast and just left us the bottled water that were given us the day before (in fairness, they were unopened, but hey, we should be entitled to 2 a day as we always take bottled water when we go out to shop and do sight weeing). Shampoo and conditioner bottles were just recapped but we were not given a new supply daily. Again, for the amount of money that this hotel charges, a 5-star service is to be expected.The hotel pool is impressive as it is on the 57th Floor, but most of the time that we were there, it was crowded. Also, for the price we were paying for our hotel stay, I expected a cleaner, nicer pool.There are 2 buffet breakfast restaurants in this hotel - the Chinese Restaurant and the International Buffet Breakfast (sorry, forgot their names). The international buffet breakfast venue was great. The kids loved it, plenty of choices, good, friendly service. However, I could speak the same about the Chinese Restaurant for the buffet breakfast. Out of the 4 mornings that we were there, we decided to try the Chinese buffet breakfast once - poor service, they basically just me the table where I could sit with my 2 children, but they didn't even offer me or ask me what drink I would like with my breakfast. Eventually, I asked for a hot chocolate - i was given a small cup of hot chocolate that was bland and watered down. They then charged me for this small cuppa (which I later discovered whilst I was checking my bill at check out).Overall, I think this hotel is overrated, overpriced. I've had far better service, quality of room, food, etc. in other hotels that cost far less than what this hotel charges. I don't think it's even worth staying in this hotel \just for the experience\"". There are a lot of hotels to choose from when you are in Singapore, so it may be worth saving your money and staying somewhere else.""",130
MBS,3,“Busiest hotel swimming pool”,"Arrived in early morning and they checked me in at 07:00, much appreciated, thank you! The shampoo, bath gel were not good in quality. Elevators require room keys to work, however, the card reader is not very easy to use and missed my floor few times as the elevators run quick. Pool were really crowded from the morning until 23:00 close, hard to find an empty chair and no shower facilities unless going back to your room. There is a bridge passing through the hotel to the sky park next door, however, it cannot be accessed directly inside the hotel. Hotel composed of 3 towers, ground entrances were only found on both ends, doors between towers were all locked which makes guests taking extra steps and not convenient at all.",294
MBS,3,"“Very good, but you're definitely paying for the pool.”","I'm glad we decided to stay here for a night, but also glad we saved our money and went to a less expensive hotel after 1 night. It was nice for the experience but we grew tired of the crowds and wildly expensive food. The whole thing was reminiscent of being on a cruise ship.Pros: The view from the pool was exceptional. This was what we were paying for and we knew it... that said, I DO think it was worth the price just for the pool. It was that good. Room was a decent size, and view from our room (ours was on the 32nd floor and overlooked the ocean) was just beautiful. En suite bathroom was large and had a massive tub.Cons: (Since it's so pricey it's kind of asking for a critical review...). -As I said, crowds, which is to be expected so really can't complain there. -Nothing special from the staff - they were friendly enough but did their job and didn't offer so much as a smile more... which I find to be a bit lacking for a 5 star hotel that charges these prices.-Lobby was entirely underwhelming. The airport has a better atrium than the Marina Bay Sands. I would describe it as... clinical. -Cheap toiletries. Cheaper hair dryer. -Curtains left large gaps on either side letting the light in completely which means waking up with the sun. - Finally, our TV didn't work and the extra blanket we found in the closet had a huge stain on it. I'm sure they would have fixed either had we bothered to complain, but we were too lazy. Overall I was glad to have stayed there. Now that I have however, I don't feel like I ever need to again.",102
MBS,3,“VERY OK !!”,I wouldnt recommend it !!!! way too impersonal for my liking...The pool was like a zoo...so damn crowded... and frankly... highly - highly highly over rated....its really no great shake !!! i prefer a quieter more serene pool...not one with 4000 people hanging around there... The view from the top..well..Ive seen better...nice room...good service.. but Ive stayed better and experienced far better hospitality in singapore. When paying top $ - i expect a lot more from a 5 star hotel.SO basically - nothing much to complain about...i guess I just expected too much.. and the pool was a HHHHUUUGGGEEEEEE let down !,120
MBS,2,“I shall not return”,"I stayed for few days with the family at the hotel. It is not a children friendly hotel, in fact it is a factory hotel, and you are processed as such. The rooms are clean however look used. They don’t serve breakfast. We had to leave early, so we asked for breakfast to be served in the room, this service they do not provide, but were willing to send a doggy bag to be eaten in the car!Last note, the view from the pool is breathtaking, but the pool is overcrowded.My impression is that the hotel was built for the casino players nearby hence of you are a gambler then go to the hotel to feel rich, otherwise forget it.",424
MBS,3,“Novelty value only...”,"We had a city-view club room over several nights. Summary: The hotel is an uncomfortable collision of upscale hotel, bulk hotel, and theme park - it doesn't work. Ride the lift, look at the view, and maybe stay somewhere that is more intimate, personable and located in an area with some character - this hotel is a convention center and generic masstige shopping arcade, in a characterless district.Pool : The rooftop pool is supposed to be a drawcard. While the views are lovely, the pool area is cramped, ugly, and overcrowded. \Exclusive access to Sands SkyPark Infinity Pool\"" as advertised on the hotel's website, really is a joke, with every one of the 2,500 rooms in the hotel, of any room type, having access to the pool. The deckchairs around the pool are so jammed it is difficult to walk among them. No change rooms are provided, so people change in the toilets, leaving the whole area flooded and chaotic. And the number of hotel guests who ride the lifts wearing bathrobes and swimwear leaves an expensive hotel looking and feeling like a public bath house.Club Room: No separate check-in or check-out was provided for club room guests, which is and should be pretty much standard for hotels with this feature and price. If you do choose to stay, the room is big for a standard club room, which is pleasant for an extended stay. However, the decor is bland, luxury without character, apart from a stylish, large bathroom. There were many small 'misses' in the room - notably, there are no useful power outlets - a kettle, coffee maker and iron are all provided, but with nowhere to plug them in - we had to use the power outlet in the desk - totally impractical. While a coffee maker is provided, there is no milk - it had to be ordered from room service each time. And, because a 'sensor' bar fridge is installed (especially NOT club room standard when you are made to feel like a potential thief) you can't store the milk in the fridge... And other little things that, while unimportant overall, detract from an experience of thoughtful, personal design for a hotel that describes itself as 'exclusive' and 'luxurious'.On the upside, all the staff we encountered were very cheerful and pleasant, especially those in the club lounge, who made an effort to remember our names, and to connect with us with a sense of real character. By contrast, all the telephone staff sounded like pleasant robots!In a word: \""masstige\"".""",122
MBS,3,"“Pool is amazing, but the normal rooms are too average.”","Our friends spent a small fortune to get a once in a lifetime stay at MBS. They were here to see me, so I felt a bit responsible. They paid big bucks and got some pretty average rooms. It took 4 complaints to get what the enormous price they paid to finally show in the room. WOW, was is special. The perks that came along with it were just as special too. Had this been the case from the beginning I think all would have been ok. The pool is so amazing and always a treat. Sit back and relax and just enjoy the view from there. I would just recommend that MBS handles customer complaints and feedback a bit more professionally.",202
MBS,2,“For the pool Only !”,"I am glad that I just choose to stay for 1 night, 1 night is enough.....Agreed with most of the previous reviews the best part of the hotel is the pool and has an Amazing view of Singapore's skyline, but it's crowd all the time !However, the rest of the hotel is just not worth-for-money ! We booked three rooms and the three rooms were ready at three different times, I got the last one at 6pm, 3 hrs later the normal check-in time !!! My whole family (with 3 kids) had to queue up for shower after swimming in two available rooms ! I didn't receive any apology when i get my room at the front desk at 6pm, even though they offered me the compensation of F&B coupon at last but this kind of service is not what we expected from a 5-stars hotel !There's no waiting / sitting area around the check-in counter at Tower 3, and the check in was a bit slow. We had to queue for 20 mins to check in and check out though there's only few customers there.Good to try once for the amazing pool, but i won't opt to stay again !If y",249
MBS,1,“Very loud”,"This was one the worse experiences I've ever had in a hotel of this category.They gave me a suite on the 14th floor, which was so close to the highway, that I could hear every car - it was so loud, I thought I would sleep directly on the highway!So I've asked to change the room, which wasn't possible in the same or higher category, so I had to take a downgrade to a normal room on a higher floor. I couldn't here the highway anymore, which was good, but instead of that the air con was so loud, that I had to turn it off at night...Anyway, next problem was that they removed all the extras from my suite package (free breakfast, pressing, pool access etc.). But I still had to pay the suite price! So I had to discuss and explain all the time to the service personal what has happened (what the service personal fortunately understood, so they were really friendly) By the way the hotel management didn't even apologize or gave a discount or some little extras for the downgrade. I had to pay the full suite price for a normal room and at the checkout they wanted to charge for breakfast (which was included!)...So I only can recommend to stay away from this hotel, there are much better hotels in Singapore, they might not have such a spectacular pool (yes, the pool is awesome), but a better management team and are more customer oriented!",402
MBS,1,“Poor Customer Service and Overpriced”,"I booked a room for my family for my Birthday April 22.I called the customer service department at 8 AM on the 22nd of April. Asked Jason if we can check in early. He said that we can check in at noon.Went to Marina Bay Sands at noon. Tried to call the attention of the bellhops and bellboys to assist with our luggage which contains a few bags plus a stroller. No one approached and helped us. Went to the registration counter. Talked to Christine (i think that was what her name was) . I told her that here is my reservation number and as per Jason of customer service advice we want to check in. She said that she cannot do that because:-She does not know who Jason was.-The customer service department is not \working with the registration counter\"" -The customer service department does not have the right to confirm early check ins. I told her that is why I called earlier today to check and they said it was okay. She finally relented when I showed her that I was with my wife and my 4 month old baby daughter.That took a good 45 minutes of convincing. What a waste of time.I also requested for a baby cot for my daughter when booking the room, talking to Jason and Christine. They all told me that it will be brought up. No baby cot came.Room was okay. Nothing to write home about. The view was nice.Food was so so. The wanton noodle was really bland. The pizza and burger were okay. Paid 150 SGD for all of them, I can say that it was definitely overpriced.The only bright spot in this otherwise bad vacation was the spa. They were courteous; customer service oriented and entertained a late booking. Marina Bay should hire them to be the customer service officers.I travel a lot for my work, around the Middle East, Asia and Europe. By far this is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. My room number was 2776 and we stayed there from April 22 to April 23. My Booking number is SCSQD. In case you want to check your records.I hope you have taken the time to read this and maybe conduct some basic customer service training for your staff. Because for the amount that you charge for your rooms, it is money best spent on someplace else.""",126
MBS,2,“There are Better Hotels in Singapore”,An interesting hotel with great views but due to the large number of people it is lacking the normal high class hotel services Singapore is famous for . Worth a try then go back to your favorite hotel. I will. The thing which annoyed me most is there is no privacy for the paying guests. We we're swimming in the pool experiencing the ambiance and turned around to see 50 or so people taking photos of the view . They were not hotel guests and I asked the club management to ask them to leave. Which he did quickly and apologised.Apparently they had come from the restaraunt nearby. The Shangrila and Four Seasons and Faimont are superior hotels. Also these hotels are closer to the shops.,74
MBS,2,“Packed and Tired”,"The pool is the highlight of this place. LV Island was also an interesting place to visit in the shopping mall. The room was a bit tired and whilst the service people were genuinely trying to help when we saw them the organisation behind their efforts was lacking. For the price we paid, we would have been pampered in nearly all of the best hotels in town. Learnt our lesson ... won't be back.",424
MBS,3,“Only for Pool Lovers”,"This is a 5 star hotel and I had high expectations. We were asked by the taxi driver which Tower we were staying in, and as we have not checked in yet, we said we did not know, so we were dropped off at Tower 1. There were no bell boy, porter nor concierge to help us with our luggage so we had to drag it ourselves to the Check In counter. There was a long queue, so we waited. Shortly a staff member approached us in the queue and asked us what type of room we had booked. We told him it was a \Deluxe Room\"" upon which he immediately told us those rooms were in Tower 3 and that we had to check in there. He pointed in the direction of Tower 3 at the opposite end of the building. It was a long walk from Tower 1 to 3 dragging our luggage and weaving through the crowd, guests and sightseers. No help was offered by any of the staff. Eventually we reached Tower 3 Check In, to yet another long queue. After waiting rather a long time, we eventually checked in and went to our room on the 49th floor.The view from this room was marvellous. Room was contemporary designed, although for such a new, top notch hotel, no-one had repaired the chipped/cracked stone bench of the bathroom. Also we noticed the bath towels were only normal size, and not the large Bath Sheets that we normally find in 5 stars.We went up for a swim in the famous Infinity pool. The views were fantastic and the pool was indeed a novelty. The whole place was very crowded and the sun beds were packed in and lined up like sardines in a tin. We had trouble finding just 2 vacant sun beds and we had the same trouble the next morning. It seemed like this place is always crowded. We did not go into the spas as there were constantly at least 12 people in them.We were so glad we had only booked one night because as soon as the novelty of the pool wore off, this hotel really only got its 5 stars for the pool and the views! Service, poor. Overcrowded. Check In took too long. The gym was in a different area (55th floor) and not near the pool. Don't go if you are looking for somewhere quiet to relax.For the high price we paid, it was very disappointing overall. Bottom line, we would not stay there again.""",195
MBS,3,“Disapointed..”,"As a global business traveller I thought I would take the opportunity to experience Marina Bay Sands on my latest trip. What was experienced was disappointing. MBS really need to urgently upgrade their check in process, as it was long and inefficient. Once I had checked in (40 minutes later) I found that they had given me the wrong room and that meant lining up again for a further 20 minutes to have this changed. No apologies were given and the staff seemed to be too busy to care. The rooms were neat but the traffic noise on the road side was irritating to the point where ear plugs had to be worn at night to sleep. The roof top pool was a novelty but can understand the attraction to so many. Requested a ½ hour late check out which was granted and found to be locked out of my room at normal check out time??. Back in the line for another 15 minutes to gain a card to access my room.Not a great example of attention to detail and was extremely disappointed in the outcome based on the hefty price tag of the stay.",184
MBS,3,"“A crowded hotel, not for relaxing time”","I am not giving it 5 rating just because it is huge, people all over and it gives you feeling that you are in a bazaar all the time except when you are in your too.My check in was not smooth. There were long lines and I was pulled out of line to a suite check in area. I was given a room on the back side of the hotel which I did not want. Room's fire alarm battery needed replacement and was whistling every few minutes. It was replaced but started whistling again in the middle of the night. My room was changed but they up selled me for extra $30.00 per night. Very cheap move by them but I was tired and accepted it .Room was ordinary though view was great. Pool on top of the hotel is unique but I dared not to take a dip among 200 bathers.I had a meeting at this hotel so it was convenient. So if youdo not have a meeting or you are not a gambler, stay away from this hotel and beware of upsell.",88
MBS,3,“Overrated hotel”,"I was here during one of the visit to Singapore, it was a nice hotel but i think it is too overrated.The price is definitely not worth the stay.Great things about this hotel : super huge hotel, nice pool, near to shopping centre (just accross the hotel) and there's a casino as well if you would like to try your luck.I would not recommend this hotel if you're going to stay long in Singapore, you'll get bored after 2 days at this hotel. Average room really, nothing fancy.",265
MBS,3,“Nice view but overrated hotel”,"I checked in with a long line because of not enough staffs at the counter.I took me over 30 mins waiting. I believed rooms might have been available enough to put me in the upper floor but they gave me 9th floor which could only see the roof of another building. When I got into the room, everything was nice except the noise over the balcony coz the building is next to highway. I could hardly sleep. Normally five-star hotel is supposed to provide us unlimited bottle of water but they gave me only one. When I wanted to go up to the pools, there was no sign or direction guide that could lead me to the pools so I had to make a call to operator. They kept me wait for 10 mins. So I figured out by myself taking the elevator up to the highest floor of my zone which is 34th floor and switch to another elevator that when I found out that lower level zone has no direct elevator up to the pools. Walking around the hotel trying to figure out how to get to the pools with my bathrobe was so frustrating. Finally I reached the pools which is on 57th floor. The guy at the entrance asked me for the pass that the staff at the counter should have informed me when I checked in but she didn't .He wouldn't allow me to enter. Somehow I gotta go back to my room. The only thing I appreciated is the bell man. He is very attentive and served me professionally",97
MBS,2,“Design Faults”,Amazing experience and wonderful pool but very full. Had a bad experience when dining on top floor having expensive menu. There was a very noisy party in private dining room which had no insulation. 5 tables as well as ours asked to be moved and staff very helpful and embarrassed but management just said nothing could be done as it was a design fault. Took the matter up next morning with management who promised a written reply but heard nothing and got impression that as Private Diners were spending a lot on alcohol individuals did not count.,165
MBS,3,“Private stay”,"Room, pool and location were great! Only the noise from outside is annoying and the balcony doors are not easy to close properly.Service was terrible: -Had to queue 45 min in front of the club lounge entrance in the late afternoon, then had only 10 minutes till buffet was cleared-20 min waiting time to get a table for breakfast-at check out, room key was inactivated while I was at the pool and nobody felt responsible to help me to get in my room - they really wanted me to go to the lobby with only a towel around my hips!! They always make you wait, than just send you to any other staff member just to get rid of you, they do not feel responsible for you. The same if you call the reception: Long waiting time in line, then connection to other department, again long waiting time, then you're just kicked off the line - no one calls back, you have to start again!",506
MBS,3,“Amazing Pool but ordinary service”,"For a 5 star hotel I was impressed by the amazing property but disappointed overall. The property engineering is a modern marvel and I fell in love with the infinity pool which was incredible. The overall vibe of the place was certainly hustle bustle but it was well positioned and had a lot of what I look for in a place to stay. However, the service was extremely ordinary. I expect a 5 star hotel to offer a wonderful service. I did not receive this nor did I see anyone else receiving this during my 6 night stay. There were 2 staff on the concierge desk and about 5-6 staff on the front desk everytime I was in reception which was often given all the issues I had during my stay. The queues for check in and check out were very long. This hotel has more than 2000 rooms so I would consider this staffing level inadequate. I booked 4 months in advance and still they managed to stuff up my booking. I emailed the week before I arrived to ensure all was well as I normally do and never received an acknowledgment. I should have guessed they were hopeless in the service side then.My real beef however is the money side of things. This arrogant hotel placed a hold on the money on my credit card prior to my checking out so when I did check out and paid the bill there were still blocks on my account that they hadn't reversed. I flew home and decided to check my account to discover my balance was not as it should be. My debit card still has 4 outstanding transactions on it which is the hotel placing blocks on my money in case I checked out without paying ?? I am assuming that this is why they do it but am totally appalled they are allowed to do this. My debit card money is still blocked. When I emailed the hotel they advised it can take up to 10 days for the blocks to be lifted once they put in a reversal so I must be patient. Mmmmm. I am still waiting for the \10 days\"" to pass so that the block can be lifted. Until then I cannot access my own money!. I've been fortunate enough to stay in many 5 star hotels around the world and never have I had this happen to me? It's bizarre they believe this is a reasonable course of action to place holds on their customers money once they have the credit card and not even mention they are intending to place a hold with the bank. If I'd known they were going to do this I would have reconsidered my form of payment. Disturbing to say the least and I am far from happy about it.So....would I go back there? I would go back only to show my husband/friends the pool. I would stay in another hotel where there is a more personalised service and attention to detail.""",328
MBS,3,“Second time with eyes open”,"This was my second visit to MBS and this time I could give it a more critical look when not overawed by it.MBS claim they want to be \magnificent destination\"" but in fact I think its missing the target. They even dictate a dress code which is largely ignored.Maybe because it was Sunday, or maybe its like it all the time, but the Sky Pool was very crowded, with barely a spare lounge anywhere to be available. It wasnt even a nice day, very windy, very cloudy, and for Singapore cool, yet the lounges were all full. The water in the pool was quite cold, obviously needing the sun to stay warm. There was also quite a bit of rubbish in and around the pool.The rooms are nicely appointed, but they have bar fridges which will bill you automatically once you take an item from it. This is ok, but prevents you putting anything else in the fridge as there is no spare space.The cable range is limited, something that surprised us for such a large hotel, trying to be a magnificant destination.Breakfast too, was not of a standard that I expect from such a hotel, the range I thought was limited, and the service was nothing special, and the price at S$38+++ is too high for what is offered. I have had better, for less.The check in was extremely lengthy, the amount of data entry that was done was astounding. I tried their on-line check in prior to arrival, but it was working properly.The staff are ok, nothing special, and largely seem disinterested. The information we received from one concierge was wrong, and prevented us seeing an attraction we wanted to see.My partner thought that MBS was nothing special, considering the price and the hype that is built up about the place. Its good, but its not very good, and there are I think better places to stay in Singapore, of a comparable standard, that are better.""",84
MBS,3,"“Good, but not that good”","Comparing with other 5 star hotels in Singapore, Marina Bay is not that good. I mean, not that good for a 5 star hotel. Keep in mind that this hotel has more than 2k rooms. After being 30 minutes to check in, there was no concierge to take our stuff to our room. We had to take it ourselves.The rooms are big and good. The view, amazing. The pool awesome. No complains at all. But it became too 'commercial' for a 5 star hotel.",182
MBS,3,“Way too busy!!!! kids running everywhere!!!!!”,We stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is huge and crowded. Kids run everywhere especially around the pool area. In fact the pool is really impressive however its not big enough for as many people as they stay there. Its so noisy no chance to relax. Forget about early check in. We had to wait until the very last minute and when we came to our room there was a couple there waiting to be relocated. So they have problems with organization. We stayed in a club room. It was nice and spacious with balcony and bay view. Really nice bathroom. We had a deal with breakfast and afternoon tea. Breakfast was very average not too many choices I expected more afyer such fancy place however the afternoon tea had beautiful snacks and free alcohol for 3 hours:))) We also liked the MBS airport shuttle free very comfortable running every 30 minsAll in all I think the place is too busy to be run smoothly and if u travel withiut kida go somewhere else or other kids will drive u mad!!!!!!,240
MBS,3,“Nice infrastructure but service normal”,"Stayed for one night in March in a high floor level facing the marina bay. Views is superb especially at night with all the buildings lighted up. Worth paying more for the view and high floor.Room was modern, luxurious and comfortable. We asked for wine glasses to be delivered to our room and it did come but took about 20 mins. Service was ok but not particularly warm.Skypark was amazing too but overcrowded. The stamp and wrist tag system for access to the sky park is a little archaic but i guess they need that for crowd control.Went to the hot pool and steam room in the Jaccuzi. Was disappointed that they have frosted the whole glass windows of the hot pool for i presume privacy issues. It was not frosted when i first visited it when it first opened and the views were fantastic. This is very disappointing. The gym is well equipped with gorgeous views of the surrounding area and the sea.The hotel has a huge shopping complex with lots of high end boutiques such as Prada, Chanel, etc. There is also a convention center there and the hotel gets very packed when there is a major convention happening. This may dampen the enjoyement of the stay due to overcrowding.The MRT station is now opened and connected to the hotel which makes it very convenient for travelling.Overall, a nice city hotel but not sure if worth the money.",284
MBS,2,“Over-hyped and/or over-priced”,"We stayed one night here booking their deluxe room. Check in:This reminded me of checking in at cruises with the queues. Although it didn't take long to queue (15 minutes but still shorter than I expected), I didn't care for the impersonal feeling the size of the hotel generated...you just know the staff will be polite but at the end of the day, you are to be 'processed through'. Room:We requested for a high floor but due to unavailability we were assigned to a room on the 10th floor in Tower 3. Big hint: Do NOT settle for a low floor room as you hear the steady highway hum ALL the time. The room was standard to me: nice large bathrooms, very average amenities for the price, small-ish bedroom area (I think the bathroom must take up most of the advertised 30+ sqm space). Aircon didn't work well and when we complained the next day it turned out that the filters were dirty so this was fixed (too late for us as we slept already). Amenities:The good thing with this hotel is the size of the establishment with the casino, parks, shops, etc. There is free wifi anywhere within the area which I found quite impressive. The shops and the food are more expensive but the choice is there. The pools (requires fee if you're not a hotel guest) were super crowded during the afternoons. We opted to come back early the following day to enjoy this. Overall it is a unique experience due to the amenities but for SGD 399 without food, I do not think it's worth it. Better stick to a day visit and pay the fee to visit the Skypark.",269
MBS,3,"“A lot of glitz, but nothing great”","My stay started off on a bad note...after arriving into Singapore at 2am, and quickly ushering to the hotel, I was greeted by a friendly front desk staff member who promptly checked me in. She let me know that I was upgraded to a \Orchid Suite\"", and I quickly said thank you. Keep in mind, she went over my reservation with me: King bed, NON SMOKING and a high floor. She must have though a suite trumps those requests, and I would be happy with a smoking room on floor 5 (the hotel has 57 floors). It was now 2:30am, and I am left standing in a room that smells like someone just finished a pack of cigarettes. After calling the front desk, they assured me that someone would bring a new key up and I would have a new room. It took about 30 minutes, but all was made well. However, not the best first impression in my mind.My new room was nice...55th floor overlooking the water. The carpeting and upholstery looked worn and in need of a good cleaning. Not what you expect for $500/night in a highly competitive hotel market. The rest of the hotel is nice, and the pool is something that is hard to believe. Just be prepared for the massive amount of people that funnel and in out of this property. It is just massive, so if you like non-stop chaos, this would be a place for you.If you do go, ask for a high floor...the view will make the dirty carpet somewhat be overlooked. I guess the maintenance staff feels the same!""",976
MBS,1,“Stay at a different hotel where you get value for money”,"Please take the time to read this and don't book your entire stay at the Marina Bay Sands like I did. Stay a night or two to experience the pool which is amazing and the views of the city from your room. But then relocate to a hotel with better service for the rest of your stay. I received an e-mail confirmation from the hotel following my booking which clearly stating “Simply show this email to the Marina Bay Sands shuttle operator at the coach terminal (available at all airport terminals)*”. Upon our arrival at 7pm however we were told that the shuttle had ceased operation. I had not asked about the shuttle service, it was presented to me. This is clearly constitutes misrepresentation?Check-in time was the longest I have ever experienced. The person typed away furiously at the keyboard for what seemed like an eternity. Despite having already submitted my credit card details upon making the reservation directly with the hotel, we were required to yet again submit a credit card. We were informed that not only a deposit, but also the entire amount was to be charged to the card. Imagine our surprise when we were presented with a bill, which once again included the room charges upon checkout. It made me wonder how many times I would still be required to submit payment for this room. Which brings me to the issue of the bill. Due to the lack of space for personal provisions in the room’s fridge, we were forced to remove some of the drinks. These were charged to the room despite being in plain view above the fridge. Then, once the staff discovered that the drinks were in fact not consumed but simply relocated, the charge was removed. This resulted in a very messy bill and a lot of confusion and wasted energy and time. I would have expected that the bill would be primed BEFORE being presented to a guest. We queued 20 minutes to be served upon checkout and with the whole bill debacle spent another 10 minutes wrapping things up. Downright inexcusable! I am aware of the express checkout, but did not wish to make use of this service for various reasons. During checkout, there was a gentleman strolling around asking guests queuing at the counter whether they were checking in or out. Instead of asking such silly questions, perhaps he could have actually checked guests in and out! I made a couple amendments to my booking before my stay and when dealing with the reservations team, I was more than satisfied. However, now upon reflection, I indicated that I wished to make use of the shuttle service on more than one occasion and the team failed to mention the fact that the shuttle no longer operated from the airport. So even the reservations team is lacking. We took breakfast in Sky on 57 every morning. Every morning, we were told that there would be a 15-minute wait for a table or the option of sitting outside without a sun umbrella or an awning in sight. That’s not really an option at all. To our amusement, many of the guests braved the sun, shading themselves under napkins. This is the Singapore sun after all! The first day we waited as instructed, however from Day 2, we opted to just sit at the bar. While our order was promptly placed upon being seated, every day our tea took longer to arrive than did our eggs. And the eggs weren’t winning any races either. I had to enquire about our meals and beverages every single day and I am not a fussy person. Having been a guest in five star establishments before like the Hilton in Beijing and The Mira in Hong Kong, I was shocked at the breakfast on offer at the Marina Bay Sands. Words cannot sufficiently describe my displeasure. The information we received from staff was outrageous. Upon questioning staff about where we could catch the shuttle to the zoo, we were told to go to the bus stop in front of the hotel. No shuttle to the zoo operates from there! I had to turn to Google to find out the information for myself after we waited 20 minutes with no luck. You would think that staff would be more equipped to handle simple tourist enquiries. Room Service was appalling. I called and placed an order for the pannino and fries, but was informed by the operator that the pannino already came with fries so I cancelled those. Well of course the pannino arrived with a salad. At this stage, I called room service to tell them about the missing fries and was informed that the pannino is served with a salad and NOT fries. Fifteen minutes later the doorbell interrupted my nap as my fries had now arrived!I deeply regret choosing to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for my entire trip. Initially we planned to stay two nights to experience the Infinity Pool, which I thoroughly enjoyed and then to relocate to a different hotel, however decided against it. This decision was the worst decision of my trip. I could have had three days staying in a world-class hotel instead of five days in a joke of a hotel. For the price that we paid, I feel utterly and truly RIPPED OFF. The foyer is not inviting nor welcoming and with the amount of people mulling about, I feel I can liken it to a bazaar. When I tell people of my experience and the price I paid (over $500 per night) they are flabbergasted. I would never in my wildest dreams have believed that a hotel with prices such as this would be so outright substandard. Stay a night and then go get value for your money elsewhere, I wish I did.",207
MBS,3,“Not bad”,Although this hotel is very nice indeed in terms of presentation I found it to be more of a tourist spot rather than somewhere where you can chill out. I must admit we didn't have any problems whilst we were there but I still felt it lacked that personal touch and you feel more like just a number rather than an individual.It has some great facilities and the views from the rooftop are just amazing I did find the main lobby area to be crowded almost all the time which was understandable seeing as it is quite an iconic building in a beautiful location.Although we were booked in a club room there was not much information about where to check in and when you first arrive at the hotel is can be quite daunting as its filled with people and no one to really guide you. Apparently people booked into the club rooms have a separate check in area (which we did not even notice neither were we informed of whilst our stay at the hotel.)Overall although I thought it was a really nice hotel I don't think I would be rushing back anytime soon purely because of the level of service we received whilst stayed there.,128
MBS,3,“Worst hotel service ever experienced”,"It was all hype. My family was so excited I booked our holiday in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands. We were awed by the nice architecture,very large lobby and nice city view. However, we were so disappointed at how long they processed our check-in, our baggages did not get to us on time (we already waited or 30 minutes but no baggage arrived), hence, we almost missed our pre-arranged afternoon tour, no free breakfast, welcome fruit basket or drinks despite the exorbitant rate for our 3 premium rooms, most staff are not courteous. and worst, a tip tapping noise from some part of the hotel bothered us and prevented us from getting a nice afternoon rest. I will not recommend this hotel to my friends and relatives.",393
MBS,2,“Not worth the money”,"Stayed with my husband in a club room during the F1 GP. The location was good in terms of the F1 as we don't mind having a walk there, also the shopping centre nearby and taxis of course are always cheap in Singapore to get around. However everything else was terrible.Firstly before we had even arrived they had overcharged my credit card by approx $400. It took a 45 mins conversation upon check in to get that rectified. We waited for about 30 mins before we were even served at check in, after staying at many clubrooms all over the world I was very disappointed at the wait to check-in. You pay the extra to bypass the long lines etc.The view I have to admit is amazing, however I am sure there are other hotels at the Marina which equally have amazing views.The club room was already ageing quickly. Tiles were lifting up in the bathroom and the showers were yellowing on the tiles.The line to get in for breakfast and afternoon snacks at the club lounge was terrible. Though we did get a good look at the view while we waited to be seated every day. The staff are not very attentive, they take their time to help you and seem to be more involved in their conversations than anything else. I was surprised as well to not see a hot meal menu to order from, which has always been the norm at any clubroom we have stayed in.The pool I have to say is amazing, however was a bit silly to wear a paper arm band to access the pool and lounge. It was very packed being the F1 weekend, was a bit disturbed that people are allowed to drink in the pool considering there are many families around.The service is not good, I expected more considering the amount you pay. Staff seemed annoyed when you asked them for something and were not always willing to help. I wonder if it's because of the volume of people there. Though when we were leaving for the airport, the taxi queue was very long and a staff member helped us to get on the MBS bus to the airport. The driver was very kind and helped us with our bags etc. The 2 of them were the nicest staff members we encountered there.",216
MBS,3,“disappointing”,"Having read the excellent reports on this hotel, my wife and I decided to spend a weekend en route to Bali. I booked the executive floor, and requested a high room with city views. I actually got a 19th floor garden view room. Not a good start. On our first night we went up to the club room on 57th floor. Yes, the views are great, and we had plenty of time to enjoy them whilst we queued to get in! This is a coctail hour from hell. Kids everywhere, difficult to get a seat, and less than impressive canapes. And no way could the room be discribed as a lounge.The next night the queues were worse, so I went to the front and demanded something be done. They took us to a bar on the ground floor!We found out on our first night that the seals were broken on the double glazing in the room. A repair man arrived, opened and closed the sliding door a couple of times, and said \fixed sir\"". What a joke. Anyway, we asked to be moved, and were offered a downgrade!!!! as other reviewers have pointed out, there are better options in Singaporee at half the price. I certainly won't use the Sands again. But the views are magnificent.""",352
MBS,2,“Impressive infrastructure but inpersonal and inconsistant service”,"Yes, the pool on the roof top and the infrastructure of this hotel are impressive - no doubt. but if you look for real 5 star service (you pay for it actually) then you have to give this place a miss.From reservation which ignored our room requests (we booked one twin and one double in the Club) to Club lounge which has no Club feel but rather a canteen feel as it is always crowed, noisy and busy – it has just a “group hotel” feel. In room amenities only one shampoo, one bathgel etc so if you take a shower twice a day due to the humid weather then you will run out very quickly. No turn down service and so on – definitely not 5 star when it comes to service. There were a few staff which were stars in their own field but the majority are working like robots – I guess due to the sheer volume of guests they have to serve. Moreover – every day they want to tag you like a dog with a paper band for the wrist to identify you as a hotel guest – rather embarrassing too and with today’s high-tech options rather a poor solution. To check out (Club counter was still closed at 6:50 am for check out so we had to queue on the main reception for more than ½ hour. One night we dined at the Chinese restaurant in the lobby and while the food was very good the service was not attentive – but what really put us off was that they seated guest next to us dressed in bathrobes and slippers! This was a place where a meal with wine costs about 150 dollars yet no standards nor dress codes where enforced – rather shocking!Rooms are nice and spacious and the gym is fantastic - but for the price paid I definitely expected more.So overall – go and have a look and maybe a luncheon in the rooftop restaurant (Kudeta) but for this price you get much better service in the many 5 star Singapore hotels available",198
MBS,3,“Disappointing”,"We were very excited to stay at this hotel after seeing pictures of the magnificent infinity pool on the roof. However, when we got to the hotel it was like a zoo. Full of people and children everywhere. The room was nice and clean, but nothing exceptional. The staff was courteous, and tried to make up for the fact that we were locked out of our room. We had dinner at the buffet restaurant, but ordered a la cart. The food was undercooked and had to be sent back. The cocktails were nothing special. We had a lovely little breakfast at the Sweet Spot. They made the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted. In general it is a nice hotel and the pool did live up to expectation, however we had to wake up at 6 am to enjoy it without the screaming kids (families tend to stay at the pool well past 9 :30 pm). In the future we will stay somewhere else. They do have a freshen up room if you have a late flight leaving Singapore and want to grab a shower before you go to the airport, but you must ask about it.",219
MBS,2,"“Big, crowded, lack of service”","I was keen to stay at this hotel given its reputation. I was significantly disappointed. This is not an intimate nice service friendly hotel. Its just way too big for that. Everywhere was crowded. I was keen to try out the pool and swim some laps. Impossible. It was more crowded than Bondi beach on Boxing day. Despite having access to the 'Club', every time I went I had to wait in line to get a table.The foyer is poorly designed and so are the rooms. Three drawers is all I could find and bad access for facilities and amenities. Be prepared to stand in line for any assistance , checking in, checking out, concierge. I don’t mean wait behind two or three people I mean try 10 to 20 people.For the price it was not an enjoyable experience, although the decor was nice, for the price it lacked the five star touches. When paying over $400 a room on a business lounge you think you would get a free newspaper, perhaps a bed turndown or some sort of evening service that most Asian hotels do well. Not at this one, it’s one giant shopping mall, no atmosphere, no intimacy, no soul. It just one big hotel. There are a lot more nicer hotels for the price in Singapore.",167
MBS,3,“If it wasn't for access to the rooftop pool I wouldn't stay here.”,"I stayed 1 night here as part of the 3 night quick holiday to singapore. My only reason for staying here was to experience the rooftop pool.The pool without doubt is AMAZING and provides some of the best views of singapore and defiantly an experience to enjoy. Note the pool is VERY busy and noisy though. I found the best time was at around sunrise 630-730am its not as busy. The hotel itself though it huge, loud and crowded. While the rooms are nice, staff are swamped by 100's-1000's of guests, wait times to check-in, concierge and even to queue for taxis outside the hotel is longer then most hotels (even large 1000 room hotels in Las Vegas). I also found the price to be very expensive for the lack of service provided. Unless (like me) you really want to have access to the pool/view, I would recommend other more and superior quality (and more affordable) hotels in singapore, or consider just spending the one night here.",149
MBS,3,“Great build big let down”,"This was a treat from my son when visiting Singapore for his wedding. Sadly myself and daughter were not impressed. Although we didn't pay the bill looking at the other reviews definitely not good value for money. Room was mediocre, service was impersonal. They answered phones to queries quickly but in person, booking in and out meant lengthy queues. It's all just to big, even cruises of 3000 people feels more personal. The term 'integrated resort' seems to be their motto, hotel and shops, nothing new here. Swimming pool was rather murky as daughter works pt time as life guard we had little confidence in the water quality. The only outstanding feature was the view, you can't challenge that. We moved onto the Carlton where we were so much more at home with the personal touch and lovely welcoming staff. Sorry Marina Bay not coming back to you ever.",208
MBS,3,“specatulor amenity but with no hospitality”,"the hotel is great in terms of its facility, architecture design, and amenity. however as a 5-star hotel and being a new landmark in Singapore, the service and hospitality of this hotel is disappointing. apart from the long check in and check out process, the biggest problem of this hotel is that all the staff have never smile or greet to their guests, who paid at least 430 SGD per night. they seem to be overwhelmed by the number of guests they have to handle every day. some of the staff were even kind of arrogant and rude, not in an obvious way, but those r something u wouldnt expect from a five-star hotelstaff in concierge does not know we could arrange airport shuttle bus to pick us up to airport, we had to find out the info and phone number our our own and asked them to phone the company to book the service. this hotel is worth spending one night just for the sake of the rooftop pool, i will never pay for the same price for myself no matter for business or holiday. you will never feel being relaxed in any corner of the hotel apart from the pool, just too big and over crowded.",440
MBS,3,"“Gym, Skypark and infinity pool”","We (2 adults + 2 children) stayed for 2 nights and got lower floor room 1128 cityview at tower 3 for the rate of S$398/night nett incl in room wifi. It was fully booked acc to the check in staff who serve us.The room (36sqm) could feel more spacious if the layout was wider rather than longer. The bathroom was large but there was no spayer for cleaning up in the closet, so for us it was not convenience. Furnishing of the room was just ordinary even lower than expected with this rate.I believe most of the guess attracted by the height of the building (so you got the view of the city) with access to the infinity pool, but actually the view of this hotel and its surroundings is the most extraordinary rather than the view of singapore from mbs skypark (so you must make a distance to got the best view of singapore that means you should stay in other hotels that sits opposite of mbs like the fullerton, marina mandarin, etc).Warm and humid climate also make the activity in the skypark less convenient without aircon, it is better if you use the pool to beat the weather while you spend your day and nights watching the city from around 200m above sea level. Fortunately, and this is the best way to enjoy the view without having to pay for a seat in the expensive restaurants and nightclub nearby, it has a large gym (banyantree gym and spa) that has full aircon at tower 2, level 55. There was sitting area with view to the sea and garden by the bay, or enjoy yoga class in their hall, or just use the gym overlooking the city. The staff in the gym was very helpfull and polite. Only adult could use the gym and its facilities such as hot whirlpool, sauna, steam rooms, also the closet equipt with spayer unlike in my roomCheck in and out was prompt but the concierge must be forgot to bring our luggages up, so i collected them by my self.When we arrive by taxi, the bell boy in front of the tower instantly collected our luggage without asking weather we will stay in the hotel or just visiting, because a lot of people come to look around and going up to the skypark also going through to the opposite building which has casino, shopping mall, even the bridge to the garden by the bay can be accessed through the hotel lobby, so you could drop your luggages or bags in the concierge for free rather than bring them along while you just visit.",487
MBS,3,“Typical Casino type Hotel”,"Getting from Changi International Airport to the Hotel is quite painless. Takes only a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport to the Hotel but that's when the problems start. As others have complained, the check in process seems to take much longer than at other Hotels. I arrived at the hotel at 2pm even though check in was at 3pm, which is much later than other hotels in Singapore. Having said that, I was checked in as my room was already ready.It's important to realise that the hotel comprises 3 towers (1, 2 & 3) with check in counters at the ground floor at Tower 1 & 3. You are not told which Tower you are in until check in so you could well check in at Tower 1 and only to be told that your room is in Tower 3. It's a very long lobby so be prepared for an up to 100m walk with luggage assuming you chose the wrong Tower to check into your room. I got Tower 2 so it wasn't too much of an issue. The next thing to realise is that each Tower has essentially two sides, one facing East (Singapore Gardens by the Bay view) where each room has a balcony or alternatively the side facing West (towards the casino and light show & financial district) where the rooms do not have a balcony. The view on both sides is very nice but if you're like me and get cabin fever couped up in a hotel room, opt for the Eastern side to get the balcony.Location wise, Marina Bay Sands essentially sits on reclaimed land away from the City. This is not too much of a problem as there is an MRT station at the Hotel which should get you to Orchard Road within 30 minutes or 15mins by taxi. Unlike other Casino Hotels, the casino isn't actually in the Hotel. It's in a building across the road from the Hotel accessed through 2 tunnels from the Hotel and is only a 5 minute walk away. The casino building also incorporates a very good shopping centre where all the major up market brands are represented. Worth mentioning is the Louis Vuitton outlet that actually sits on it's own little island on the Bay. My main interest in the shopping centre were the named chef restaurants within the Complex. You've got Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud and Guy Savoy restaurants within the Complex which makes the complex a destination in itself.At the end of the day however, the Marina Bay Sands largely exists due to the Casino. So whilst there is a lot to attract the non gambler, be prepared for the gambling crowds at the Hotel. I'm still not sure whether I will stay here again although the restaurants are definitely a draw, but fighting to check in to my room is a bit of a turn off.",115
MBS,3,"“Something is missing, no heart”","We recently stayed at the Marina Bay sands on an overnight visit. We were staggered that at 1am in the morning the reception is so busy and while their was 4 staff members the checkin process is the longest we have ever experienced. I have no idea why it takes to long. While the rooms are amazing the size of the hotel just leaves the whole experience as cold and unwelcoming. There is no heart or sole in the place and I believe the designers have missed something vital.Would I stay here again? well thats simple No and I would definately not recommend, for the money there are many nicer places in Singapore to stay",176
MBS,3,“Awesome place with several inconveniences”,"Stayed there on business at Tower 3 in Jan 2013.Deluxe room was cool,spacious and with full glass city view.The infinity pool facing the skylight was a delight. The access control to the pool was useful as it limits the number of pool users. One shd try the pool and see the sunset then view the night lights of the nearby skyscrappers. It was a pretty sight.However,the parking is a maze underground. The 3 towers complicates parking further. No complimentary parking extended to hotel guest was a put off.Valet parking voucher only available at tower 1. Lobby drop off/pick up point was very small at Tower 3 and always crowded.There was no doorman to open the doors in most times I went thru those doors where it was chaotic and unwelcoming.Honestly, the design and layout sucks as it cause many inconveniences to hotel guests.Hotel lobby across the three towers were always busy with people passing thru in either directions and feels like you are on the way to a train station.I would not recommend family stay there.",108
MBS,2,“Not to expectation except view”,"My first visit to Marina Bay came not to expectations, as check in takes long time, no luggage service, it is like shopping mall with too many people & with luggage to travel to Tower 3 is really painful. However, reception helped me to get city view on tower 3 appreciated but it came with additional cost. Inside room, is big but not much high quality, but comfortable when you see city view. Breakfast is soso not to the Singapore taste and expensive, in future, will take outside. Overall, I will say, one time is enough as for all my visit, I will better go with Orchard road.",67
MBS,1,“Design”,Compare to casino hotel in others country. This is the worst hotel I stayed. Lobby n room design very bad and expensive. Few like illegal immigrant to enter casino coz need to verified our passport for three times. People who does not hv experience to book hotel. Dun be cheated by the picture. Think b4 u book. Just like u chkin apartment only. Swimming poor...Haiii no comment.Tourist.,1109
MBS,2,"“Great Rooms and Facilities, But Poor Service”","We have heard much about the Marina Bay Sands hotel from other colleagues and friends who have stayed there previously, split almost half positive and half negative. We took a chance this time on our trip to Singapore and decided to stay at the MBS for the first time, booking an Orchid Suite room on the 51st floor. We stayed for a total of 3 nights.The value for the room and facilities offered at the rate was great -- you can certainly spend a lot more for the same level quality of rooms and facilities offered elsewhere like the nearby Fullerton Bay or Four Seasons in Hong Kong. With the Orchid Suite we managed to get a spacious room on the 51st floor overlooking the Marina Bay. Bed was medium soft, very comfortable. Bathroom was immense with a full bathtub, roomy shower, and 2 wash basins. With the Club Suite, we managed to get complimentary breakfast at the Club on Skypark on 57F, next to the infinity pool, as well as access and use of the exercise room on 55F. The machines at the gym were excellent quality -- everything was offered from free weights to machine weights to cardio machines.Unfortunately, the service for the hotel of this quality leaves so much to be desired for. If you decide to stay here, be assured to wait at least 10 minutes for service for everything (and we mean everything). The self-service attitude of the hotel and the staff may either turn you off or please you -- depends on what you desire. 1. Check-in :We arranged transportation from Changi to the hotel and were promptly met by the car service. This was great. Drive from the airport to the hotel took about 30 minutes. We checked in at 6am... or tried to. We read on the reviews that check-in process was lengthy and line ups were long, and that there is only 1 checkin counter for 3 towers. When we arrived at 6am, the lobby was empty... but no one was at the check in counter, no anyone was on hand to greet us. We had to flag down a staff before we could check in. Once we did, she helped us to check in, gave us our keys, and then waved us to the lifts. We carried our own luggage to the room.2. Keycards / Elevators :A special note about the keycards and the lifts -- they are confusing and hard to use. You have to insert the keycard in the slot, wait a second, remove it, and press the button for the floor you want. Ok, so how hard can it be? Well, first off -- the button has a ring of light surrounding the outside edge. When it is not pressed, the lights are in muted white light. When pressed, the floor buttons light up in sharp white light. Sort of like a low headlights on a car and high-beams. Also, if for some reason the keycard doesn't work (about 2/3 of the time we had to insert, press, re-insert, press) the buttons when pressed WILL light up (thus making you think everything is working) but will go back to muted white light after a second. If you aren't watching carefully, the lift will either miss your floor or doors close and... lift won't move. Quite frustrating -- can't figure out why they don't just have different colors on the lift buttons so that guests can understand if it works or not. Or use a card reader that allows you to tap the sensor rather than insert / re-insert keycard.3. Service Service quality was extremely poor. As mentioned previously, check in process was lengthy and absent of staff -- we had to hunt someone down. There is only 1 check in counter for the entire 3 towers of the hotel.As we were in the suite, we had access to butler service or \instant service\"" on the phone. Every time we called for help or service we were put on hold or had to wait for at least 5 minutes. Direction help from the staff also were confusing -- we asked for directions from the hotel to the nearest Ding Tai Fung restaurant and were told to basically find it ourselves in the \""mall\"". Poolside, the staff were great, but seemed too busy during the early afternoon hours. Not enough staff translated to hurried service. We ordered lunch on the last day and they mixed up our order. We ordered a mango smoothie which had to be sent back twice before it was correctly done.We had also arranged for a late check out on the last day at 6pm since our flight departed in the evening. On the last day, we couldn't get back in to our room after we came back from the pool as the hotel locked out our keycards without warning. Again, it took a marathon of waiting before we finally went down to the lobby and approached a staff to ask for help.One bright note on service was Giselle -- she went to great lengths when she heard our complaints to make right everything for us. She took upon herself to take ownership of our issues and sorted everything out for us. Many thanks for your effort, time, and help!Also, our driver back to the airport was great! If you ever use the MBS car service, make sure your driver is Edy. Great guy!4. Infinity Pool on 57FThe infinity pool deserves special mention as it's one of the main attractions. We loved the pool and lounging poolside was great. There are a lot of guests there so it does tend to get quite busy late mornings and early afternoons, so getting the chairs might be difficult. However, we didn't find it so much trouble.The pool is long, and divided in to 3 sections. There is one section only for adults and that is where we lounged. No problem with kids running around as mentioned in other reviews, though we did see many families with kids.Be prepared to see every swimmer with a camera, iPhone, or iPad though, lol. Great place to just take pictures -- the views at the top of 57F is simply astounding. Nothing quite like hanging at the edge of the pool looking down to the Marina Bay.5. ConclusionWorth the stay at MBS at least once to experience the infinity pool if you've never had the chance before. Expect more self-service rather than relying on the staff to anticipate your needs. However, the next time we're in Singapore we will try other hotels rather than stay at Marina Bay Sands again.""",117
MBS,1,“Rooms average Staff unhelpful”,We arrived after noting we were on honeymoon. They said only a room with two separate beds was available. We were downgraded to a worse room and given a $30 refund on a $700 a night booking. Staff were terribly unhelpful and told us we should be happy with that and that its fair. There are restaurants in the hotel which you are forbidden from entering unless you are staying in a suite (costs thousands a night)Overall the rooms are very average and nothing special. You are paying for the pool and everything else is second rate even though you are paying top dollar. Stay one night one then move on somewhere else. 3 out of 10,123
MBS,2,“Service is below average for a 5 stars hotel.”,"Service staffs are simply overwhelmed by the amount of guests. As you entered the receiption area. It seemed like enerting a conventional room. Greeted by a staff only acknowledged my parter as Sir and it seemed like I was invisible. Check in staff failed to give us the sky park tickets. We have wasted our time to just go up and down for it. Smoke free room is not 100% smoke free. Concierge was unfriendly. The positive parts are their room is very big and nice. City and skypark views are fantanstic.This hotel is too huge, staffs are overwhelmed. I prefer to spend the same amount in other 5 stars hotel and get a warm welcome and friendly service. I will not return.",257
MBS,2,“Not close to as expected”,"Overall my impressions are mixed here, stayed in a grand club room:Check in is slow, not fast and easy. Add to that our room was not ready on time either - no appology or anything.Room itself was good, quite large, clean an nice. Comfortable bed. Not luxurious though. Overall this was okay, but there are significantly nicer rooms at a lower cost.Club cocktail hour was nice BUT during the weekend it was overcrowded and there was a line where people who were unlucky needed to wait 30-40 minutes, for a cocktail. That is not acceptable, if one feel like having a relaxing drink early in the evening in a relaxing atmosphere that should be possible without that hassle. No it became something bordering an McD of club lounges. Stressful and overcrowded - it seems the hotel happily under-dimensioned that part.Pool, it is nice, really nice, but again, often a bit too crowded and noisy. Adding to that it seems that tour groups are coming up to take pictures (hearing a large ground doing their load yelling and picture taking is not fun) turning this great feature into something nice, but not great.Breakfast in club lounge okay, nice view and reasonable foods. If you come when no lounge that is.Check out was quick for us, no waiting, however, 5 min later a long line.Overall, I would not go back, buying a separate pool pass for a day, maybe, staying, no. The price is high and then the expectation is that it should be great hotel, but it isn't.",221
MBS,1,"“Overpriced, under serviced, package tour hotel”","Yes, the top deck is fabulous and, yes, the rooms are comfortable. But here is some advice based on my visit:1. This hotel is often overbooked, the front desk told me. Don't assume you'll get the room you've booked and paid for.2. If the hotel can't give you the room you've booked, they will give you a level lower, not higher. They won't refund the price difference if you didn't book on their website. Instead they may offer you a credit of S$100 to use in the hotel. They may say this is compensation but it isn't - since you've overpaid for a room you don't get.3. Deal with a supervisor if you are not happy. The regular staff are polite and apologetic, but they will just work to a script if you complain.4. Check out queues are long and slow. If you do manage to get a credit and free breakfasts, as I did, you can't use the express check out machines as they need to do a lengthy manual voiding on your bill.This is an expensive hotel that claims to be luxurious, but offers no sense of hospitality or customer service. Just pay the $20 or so and go up to the top deck as a day visitor - it's the best bit about this otherwise Vegas-style package resort.",166
MBS,2,“Mixed experience”,"I stayed here for 4 nights for a days holiday and a few days business. I had booked a king room, arriving from an international flight and on checkin was informed there was only a twin room available for myself and my partner. This room was on the 2nd floor. There was a motorway outside of the window and the noise was incredibly loud. I spoke to the reception the next day and they informed me that pretty much anyone staying below the 5th floor complained of noise. I dont think it is acceptable for a hotel pitching itself at this level of quality to sell rooms with this much noise. They moved me to a higher floor the next day and the room was lovely and quiet and lived up to my expectations. I'm just astounded that the hotel continues to sell rooms on floors so low down or has not put in additional sound proofing in those rooms to make the noise level acceptable.",111
MBS,3,“Well the pool is great”,We took the shuttle to the hotel and that is where the poor service started. I had to lug our cases onto the shuttle myself and upon arrival at the hotel we were left in a basement carpark with no assistance with luggage or instructions on where to go. Despite booking a twin bed horizon club room we had a king so I was left to sleep on a very hard portable bed. The view was great and the pool is fantastic. But this place is too big to give personal service to hotel guests. I would recommend a one night stay only just to have a swim in the pool.,618
MBS,2,"“Save your money, stay in other 5 star hotel in Singapore for genuine service!”","The advertisement and the glam is more than what you get from the experience in staying in Marina Bay Sands. I had high expectations from this hotel but found it lacking professionalism and personal attentions.I booked my room from the hotel website for my transit stay and to be honest my room was a good size and beautiful views over the bay, the amenities and room fittings were in acceptable level for a 5 star room.The problems came from the service and lack of attention to details, when I arrived into Singapore (Changi Airport) my confirmation stated clearly (highlighted) free shuttle service to the hotel in which I tried getting but was advised by Changi Airport that the hotel has stopped providing this service only 8 days prior to my stay. So I called the hotel and the phone operator simply said we cancelled the service already and I had to take a taxi, when I explained that it was written on my confirmation and therefore it was legal, the phone operator simply said \I will let management know\"" and offerred no alternative.Arriving at the Hotel Lobby, for a 5 star property there was no doormen to greet and open the door (which I would have expected for a self proclaimed 5 star hotel), The lobby felt like a zoo or an attraction where there were literally hundreds of people around and at least 30 people lining up for check in and check out. It took around 45 minutes just to check into the hotel!Again I raised the point that free shuttle was written on my confirmation email just to see what the check-in staff would do and all I got was a \""sorry\"" and no further explanation was given, very dissapointing.Went to the Skypark to enjoy a swim in the infinity pool only to find the whole deck full to the brim with people and again felt the lack of exclusivity and high standards that could be expected from a true 5 star hotel experience. Just add that during my brief swim I saw mucus floating a used band aid floating around the pool (disgusting).After dinner went to check if I could get a late check-out since my flight home is at 7pm and was told that check-out time is 11am and only can extend for additional 1 hour 12pm. Check in 3pm and check out 11am?! felt like a recording that every receptionist had in Marina Bay Sands. Tried again to leverage from the non-free transfer! the person at reception (Sunil) simply said we cancelled that service 14th of April and you should have received an email. I told him I received no email and he said \""oh\"" he said that if I wanted to extend to 3pm-4pm I would have to pay additional half day use. I told him most other hotels would at least give up to 2pm, he said \""we check-in thousands of people everyday\"" which made me feel very insignificant and had never had this kind of response from a hotel before. I always believe that a successful hotel is one that made it's guests feel special and I guess this is what is lacking in Marina Bay Sands Hotel.I explained to Sunil that I never had such an experience before in a hotel in Singapore and how dissapointed I was with this hotel and that it would be unlikely that I return for business or leisure. He didnt really care, simply because thousands of people get sucked into staying in this hotel everyday because of it's hype. I will conclude taht I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I recommend the hotel or Skypark to anyone ... EVER!""",169
MBS,2,“Not worth with it price”,"During our vacation in Singapore, we recently stay in 3 different hotel : The Sentosa Resort & Spa, Hard Rock Hotel Resort World and we would like to keep the best for the last The Marina Bay Sands.Sadly, this hotel is far less then we expected. The hotel was so crowded, no bell boy to help our baggage, every guest only can use the pool once a day, restaurant staff has lack of knowledge when we asked which restaurant I can order ala carte menu for my daughter breakfast. Room price also very high and not worth, compared to other 2 hotel we recently stayed (room size, facilities, etc).The plus point of this hotel we found at the pool, the staff at pool was so kind and helpfull, and yes it is a stunning view from the pool. And another plus point, they provide shuttle bus to airport.Traveler with children must extra careful with the fridge, since they using automatic charge for every stuff picked up from its place.",268
MBS,1,“Disappointed”,"We were so excited to go to Marina Bay and booked a nice 79 sq.m room 45 days in advanced. (493 S$/night)Waited at the airport on the arrival day looking for shuttle bus hotel for 1 hour with 2 toddlers and a grand mother. We later found out that they cancelled the bus so we took taxi to hotel. We found out at reception that this room offered only 1 bed and no baby cots. We later could get a small extra bed and a baby cot. We also waited for the room another 3 hours and got key card and went up to the room then found that the keycard didnt work so we asked the staff who came to open the door if he could go down to pick up the new keycard. He said you have to do it yourself. I held my baby (10kg) went down and up. AT night, the air con was set at 20.5 C and was extremely cold. I called operator she told me she could give me more blankets but temperature in the room can't be adjusted. Before checking out, my bill has extra charge from minibar which I was told not to lift up anything because it will be charged to my bill. Well, I did not but there was a charge. The VIP lounge needed to wait for a long time and small. The infinity pool is impressive by the view not the pool itself. Food is good but the combination was only ok. So far, the experience is not worth the price we paid at all.",209
MBS,3,“Celebrating Friend's B'day”,"My friend had a Premier Room for staycation as well as his birthday celebration. i had a chance to visit the room. The room was at level 40, first impression was neat n tidy, esp the view from the room at night look awesome. although the room not facing garden by the bay, Anyway i suggest if any guests like to watch beautiful scene of Singapore at night, try to request high floor corner room because better and quiet. of cause if u staying there, how can we miss the chance of visiting the skypark at MBS. I suggest go in the morning & at night because in the morning can see clearly of the beautiful view of Singapore and at night can enjoy the light up building. if let me choose, i prefer going at night because can see beautiful light up building compare going in the morning. The room service were abit slow, we requested for some ice for our drinks and a box of tissues, they came within 15min, maybe they are busy. anyway that fine with us. Overall the room not so bad. Anyway i like their lounge at the lobby, nice place to drink and relax. they also had live band, the music awesome.",350
MBS,2,“Disapointing service”,"Today I checked out of the Marina bay sands hotel, I had stayed in the orchid suite for 7 days, at a cost of about 900 dollars per night, total bill was 6000 + dollars. When I checked in I was told that if I sign up for the lifestyle rewards I would get the 3 per cent worth of credit when I check out. I didn't show them my lifestyle rewards card upon check out today, they should have known it and had the details in their system, but about an hour later I emailed them my life style rewards membership number and asked them to credit me the points. They have said no, they can't do as i didnt show them the card. This has left a bitter taste and hence I will never go back. I deduct two points for this. Some other thoughts...for a 900 dollar a night room I expect the following, none of which were provided. These are very small things, but it's the small touches that make a hotel truly excellent.  - no turn down service - no news paper - wifi failed every day and I had to waste time ringing up and dealing with tech support - I do not expect to queue for breakfast which happened once at the club - I do not expect to have to ask for something at least twice, and sometimes three times, every single day at breakfast at the club. On the plus side..- orchid suite has great view of gardens by bay..- awesome swimming pool, although at times a bit resembling a cheap Spanish holidayBut overall not worth the money, I would recommend two nights max and then move to somewhere like intercontinental or oriental which are cheaper and are truly five star.Amy, the girl in the club , was the only one who showed any personality and had a friendly manner. I also noticed massive queues for breakfast for one not staying in the suite, and really long check in queues also. The hotel itself also feels more like an airport. RegardsRory",342
MBS,3,“Great Rooms - But You're Just a Number”,"Stayed two nights at this after 2 nights at the Grand Hyatt on Scotts Road. Check-in was a nightmare. Lots of people and staff, but everyone was being processed so slowly. Such a busy hotel should have these processes sorted out by now. It shouldn't take 10-20 minutes for each booking to check-in!In our case we waited 25 minutes before even getting to the counter. And we had to complain to a passing staff member to even get served that fast. What really irked is that one passing staff member checked that we had our reservation on his iPad - why couldn't he just do the check-in on the spot. They had all the details from their reservation system.On the plus side, they did give us a room upgrade after we complained - thanks. The room was very nice, with a great view out to sea (hundreds of ships lit up at night). We visited the infinity pool on the roof. Nice to relax in and enjoy the view. Pity about the groups of sightseers walking past behind the pool taking your photograph while you swim. It might be a good additional fundraiser for the hotel, but it's an invasion of privacy for the guests.The hotel also cancelled it's free bus service to and from the airport while we were there. During our stay, we enjoyed the room, but the rest of hotel and staff make you feel like a number. Just one of the thousands passing through. Coming from the Grand Hyatt made this particularly stand out, with the staff there making you feel very special.The location is also pretty poor, needing a taxi or the MRT to explore the more interesting parts of Singapore. There is a MRT station at Marina Bay Sands (Bayfront), but it's not a main line. It's a branch and suffers from having to change trains at another station to get anywhere else.So overall - nice rooms, pool impressive (could be deeper, with some lanes for actual swimming), great views. But not worth a repeat stay.",301
MBS,2,"“Too big, too standard... no personality”","Just your average 5* hotel with a bad attitude. Stayed here for a week on business with work colleagues. Check in took forever, my room was at the back of the hotel near the road so lots of noise. Had a sliding glass door with a balcony that was so narrow you couldn't even stand on it... and I was really annoyed when I tried to make an early reservation in one of the restaurants on the top of the hotel (for 7pm) as my colleagues and I had other plans for later in the evening and we had to eat early. They told me they were fully booked at 7pm but could book me in for 9.30pm.. which was too late as we had to be somewhere else then. One of my other colleagues rang them to try again... lo and behold he managed to get the exact same booking I had asked for and been refused. And then when we arrived at the restaurant at 7pm.. we were one of four tables seated in the whole place. Fully booked my [--]. Why lie about this? Why refuse a reservation from a guest staying at your hotel at the time they prefer to eat in your restaurant? Also this place it just that little bit too far out of the city to make walking in and around practical on a hot day. I've stayed at the Fullerton before and much preferred that to MBS. Though the Sky garden and Ku Da Ta were worth a look. My final thoughts are that this place looks, feels and acts exactly like what it is. And that's as an enormous luxury 'dormitory block' for the wealthy Chinese gamblers who frequent the casino located in the attached convention centre. Nothing more and nothing less.",111
MBS,3,"“stunning rooftop pool, otherwise not too excited”","Was pleased to be booked in here for a business trip and the rooftop swimming pool is obviously stunning.But otherwise at 400 dollars a night i was pleased it wasn't my money i was spending!The rooms are of a good business class hotel standard but the place is just too big, too crowded, too impersonal, a bit too \showy\"" for my taste and having to queue for a table at breakfast? Seriously? At these prices?Actually, the breakfast was a real disappointment. I've had some great breakfast buffets in Asia before but the range and quality here was weak and was very poor value at $44 per person (inc. service and tax)""",126
MBS,3,“The pool is the special part”,"Marina Bay Sands (known locally as MBS) is an extremely large hotel, with 3 large towers. Atop the towers on level 57 is a spectacular infinity pool overlooking the city.The pool is 150m by 10m and has a sensational view. There are rows of deck chairs and a palm garden, with several restaurants and bars. It's fairly busy, so early morning and evening are best. Food and drinks are expensive up there. The hotel is fine, but doesn't feel special because it is so busy. There must be several thousand rooms. Across the road is a very large premium shopping mall and the casino. All the high end brands are there, but don't expect a bargain.One option would be to stay somewhere else and visit MBS.",382
MBS,3,"“booked brekfast with room online, but told was not included on arrival”","Currently at the sands hotel and have 5 days left, so early review.Architecture is stunning, views spectacular and infinity swimming pool on the roof is truly breathtaking. Room is very spacious and comfortable.However my wife and I are very disappointed with service so far. When booking online, we clearly booked a room with breakfast included. Now we have checked in, we have been told we do not have breakfast included, so that will be charged an extra $80 per day??? We were also meant to be met at the airport via a shuttle bus provided by the hotel, but on arrival we were informed it was not opperating, even though we had received email confirmation stating that we would be collected.We spoke to a manager today to rectify the errors. Unfortunately, we were up against a brick wall of policy and indifference. 'Sorry sir, we are fully booked for breakfast' seemed an odd excuse when non residents were clearly queuing for tables as we spoke. A manager simply repeated what the reservations desk had already said. She seemed unapologetic for the mix up!The hotel's refusal to accept they had made an error means that we are now out of pocket.We also had to ask for the money back for our taxi fare from the airport, as this was not even offered.Be careful and check what you book via the Marina Bay Sands website, as what you get may be different. I advise you to print out the website confirmation screen as you see it online, before payment, which we sadly neglected to do, as did not anticipate such an error from a 5 star hotel.No sense of personal sevice so far other than from David who carried our luggage and gave us a great guide to the hotel and city. Maybe this place is too big for them to make you feel little more than a number, which is a shame because it is spectacular to look at.Not sure the self service kiosks to check out are a great message to customers when you are spending thousands to stay here. Thank you and good by from a computer is not great is it :)Off to the pool now, but might update this in a few days at the end of our stay.",113
MBS,1,“Unskilled guest services”,"Do not expect guest services at all. Just check in to get entitled to roof top pool.Hotel receptionists, no matter male or female, do not smile. Instead they are taking minutes hitting keyboards, waiting for reply by intercom, swiping cards, and responding to guest complain. In peak time, it takes 15 minutes to complete check out only for even a guest. I see many guests complain at staff for fear of delaying to Changi Airport. The management has never set up guest lane to organize flow since its open 3 years ago. Hotel employees look so tired at every moment. Every guest relations including reception, restaurants, guest room is run by unskilled staff.",159
MBS,3,“Too busy”,"The pool and the view is absolutely amazing and staying at the Hotel is definitely an experience on it's own. The Barman at the Pool Bar was amazing. For a Luxury Hotel, we found it too busy and crowded. There are loads of tourists around and it doesn't feel like you are staying at a Luxury Hotel at all, more like a Tourist Attraction. The Service is good, but not outstanding, as staff is just very busy. The Breakfast Restaurant are on the bottom floor, what feels like right in the middle of the Lobby. It is very busy and we didn't go for Breakfast there, as the line was just too long before we were able to get a table. There are better Hotels in Singapore if you are after a bit of 5Star Luxury, that have a more exclusive feel, but staying at the Sands for a night just for the experience and the pool is o.k.",178
MBS,2,“This Place is a Circus”,"My wife and I decided to stay here because I wanted to swim in the pool that overlooks Singapore.Well that was mistake.

Rubbish on tables, plates on tables, glasses on tables, that are not quickly cleared add to the experience. Its chaotic.On top of all of that Non-Smoking rooms smell of smoke because the smoke in other parts of the hotel gets into the system and no one is spared. How do I know, I know because I had one non smoking room and had to move to another only to find we had the same problem.When we asked for the replacement room we waited and waited and waited. No one came so we went looking for someone to help. We booked a more expensive room as a matter of interest.We will never ever stay here again.

I actually don't mind to pay extra cost to obtain a better room and view, but if i already paid, why i need to pay double?? It might be the problem between the agent and hotel, but i can't see a 5-stars hotel help their customer to solve the problem or try to make them have a nice trip..especially, it's my anniversary trip!! I never imagine a 5-stars hotel ruin my anniversary, this is my 1st time to singapore and experienced their SPECIAL way to treat their tourist..",75
MBS,1,“Poor service from the staff and fake promotions”,"Staff service is really bad. Even through the call centre also they, don't talk nicely to the customers specially if you have a free night vouchers. Never get the availability on the dates you desire.

Then just don't give the free nights if you don't want the guests to avail this facility",60

Only after saying that it was my bday and this is not really how anyone wants to spend their big day, did the manager take it on to himself to try to make up for the otherwise poor service.He provided a \surprise\"" cake in my room which was appreciated.MBS is too big a hotel for any kind of personalised service. It's a convention hotel and operates like a factory. Nice enough place, and location is ok, but a business hotel not a family or destination venue.""",95

I really like the bathroom layout where shower, toilet and tub are all separate and we could use it all at the same time! Checking out was also a breeze with the card drop. The pool was also awesome except that the water was cold no matter what time of the day, perhaps because its so high up?? Besides that, it would be nice to stay there again.All staffs very bad image for me as hotel guests",114
MBS,3,“tourist trap - you feel like being in a mall rather than a luxury hotel”,"i mean..it is OK..but defitetely it doesnt worth the money and the effort!yes..the infinite pool is impressive..but it takes 15-20 mins to actually reach the pool..and you cannot actually swim because it is overcrowded and not deep enough..and you cannot get a chair either..and the stuff..not really kind..room was finecasino also goodbut too crowded, takes a long time to check in, a lot of time to get a taxi, to get your bags to the room if you are lucky quickly, if not 30 mins to 1hr..been there, checked..never again!i also spent time in Mandarin oriental - half the price and by far much better experience!!!!better look at it from outside rather than inside!",65
MBS,3,"“Beautiful afar,not fab inside”","It really is a beautiful part of the Singapore skyline but my experience within the hotel was not as great as I would have liked it. My main reasons are: Over priced; Chaotic in the reception area; Rooms could be better. Having said this, the pool is fantastic and so a stay at the hotel for the pool maybe worth it (for just one stay).",146
MBS,3,“Worth A Stay For the Infinity Pool and Sky Park!”,"I checked into a hospitality suite which is spacious, modern and lovely. The check in, even at the VIP lounge, was not express. location wise, this hotel is not the most convenient. A lot of walking is needed before one eventually gets to the room! The real highlight of a stay at MBS must be the famous infinity pool and sky park, exclusively for use of hotel guests. The view and feel from this 57th floor is indeed worth a visit and gratifies your stay. Perched above in the sky and overlooking the sky scrapers of modern Singapore, it gives the feeling of high life in Asia, from the heart of it all in a key city. The pool may be crowded but you should be able to find a corner of your own and enjoy the moment in time.Bring your camera for the sky park!",649
MBS,3,"“Stunning Views, Barely Average Hotel comparable to a disney attraction”","I'm extremely critical in all my reviews as Trip Advisor has served me abounds for the past 10yrs now its time to pay it forward. Ahh where to begin, first off MBS \Operations-insert staff name here) save your BS reply to this review, you had your shot, you know your weaknesses focus on improvements (clearly im not the only one here with gripes) & u won't have to hang around on TA defending your overpriced tourist trap. So shall I begin? I was taken back by nearly $500usd a night on a weeknight, but it was to be my crown jewel in my trip to asia for 3 weeknights (i'm not rich) Unfortunately I arrive in SIN terminal to find the MBS greeting stand empty, hey they had some sing maps in korean if you needed them. I proceed to the coach pickup for my free shuttle bus. Standing around for 10 min, nobody knows nothing, of course. Low and behold I find the bus wayyyy down the end stall 35 small white letters stating MBS on this huge bus wrap, I mean really? I ask the driver, MBS shuttle? he replies go back to stall 13. OK? I wasn't the only 1 waiting for another 10 minutes at stall 13 thereafter only to have the SAME IDIOT I just spoke to i think Chiangi was name? Pull the bus in from the back of the lot stall 35!!! He was busy on a smoking break before he pulled in to infamous stall \""13\"". Great start MBS, get to the hotel easily check in, no wait as others have stated but I was getting there at 6pm on weekday. The room, MAYBE a $300usd a night room at best, with an odor of something everytime i walk in, now Im not a crybaby, I don't need to be coddled or pampered or staff attention to have a great stay anywhere (read my reviews I stay all diff price points) BUT for the money expectations were high. Enclosed are the photo of the used Qtip that greeted me next to the daybed in my room when I walked in, & to save you 15minutes of looking I have showed you how to turn the desk lights on/off hidden in the pull out drawer of the nightstand?? Because that's where I always look for lightswitches. Overall it appears the maid did the bare minimum prior to my check-in, long black hair that wasn't mine on the shower wall and a faint odor of urine in the toilet room. In fairness during my stay my room was well kept each day. The staff also was pleasant & helpful if needed, but this is very expensive hotel, these should NOT be compliments at this price point, they are expectations! If you want great food and variety walk to the food court in the connected mall, ALL the food in singapore (excluding restaurants) is fairly priced and amazing. The roof & pool, YES it is stunning, YES I was speechless night or day u must see it. I lucked out the weather was cloudy so it kept the tourists at bay. But this hotel is a chinese & korean tour group clicky clicky camera take a 1000 photos tourist trap. I felt like I was at Disneyworld staying here & I have stayed at many huge hotels in Vegas without that feeling, I walked through a bunch of hotels throughout my trip in sing and found a few I would consider for my stay next time (they happen to be #1 & #2 on TA ratings...shocker). I couldn't even imagine what this place is like on weekends & holidays with the crowds. I'm sorry but MBS fell short bigtime, perhaps if I was getting off the tour bus from mainland PRC with 85 of my closest friends I might have had a better time....""",72
MBS,3,“Very average”,"Whilst the pool at Marina Sands is unique, the rest of the hotel is nothing to write home about. There are many other hotels in Singapore that offer better service and value for money. I would recommend staying at this hotel for one night to experience the pool and then moving onto somewhere more luxurious for a better price. Also, don't make the same mistake as me and assume breakfast is included.",115
MBS,3,"“Incredible design, ordinary hotel”","We stayed here for three nights and our room (4662) was very nice, nothing more or less than you would expect from a '5 star' hotel. However, despite the magnificent design of the place, and it truly is a magnificently designed building, there are several flaws.First the ground floor is nothing more than a place for tourists or 'non-guests' to wander through taking pictures, The dining has nothing exclusive about it except the prices. The swimming pool is too busy and the transfer of lift transferring is tedious. There are not enough 'quiet' areas in the hotel. The gym is excellent though. Overall I'm glad to have experienced it, but we wouldn't stay there again.",762
MBS,3,“nice to try once. but probably not twice.”,"I just had to try this iconic hotel of Singapore during our very short visit to the country.We stayed only one night here, and it was enough to experience what the hotel had to offer for my personal taste/ needs.My main attraction for the hotel was the infinity pool at the top. The view from it was very nice, and I liked the fact that the pool was only 5 feet deep since I'm not a good swimmer. So, it gave me the opportunity to enjoy the view without struggling to keep me afloat in the deep end.However, as the hotel is very large, the pool can become very crowded, so visit it early morning, when it was less crowded.Me and my husband stayed at a club room with a city view. So we checked in at the VIP lounge, located separate from the main lobby/check in area. Even at the VIP check in lounge, the queue was long and we had to wait about 20-25 min STANDING to check in. The hotel provided free water, but it would have helped to have a more spacious area with more seats if we need to wait that long to check in. Our room on the otherhand was HUGE!! Which is nice, specially in a small country like Singapore. But at the same time, it were too large to the extent that it felt too empty at the same time. The view was nice and the rooms came with free internet, which are definitely plus points.But, it didn't captivate me enough to feel the luxury we spent our money in. The placement of the coffee maker and the glassware + coffee/tea products, didn't make good sense too. The cofee maker along with mugs were in the closet with empty drawers, while the rest of the glassware along with cofee & tea were in the living room drawers under the TV table, which I didn't expect to find. Also, to my despair, the expresso maker when I orignally found it (without locating the coffee/ expresso cups), was not cleaned and had a pre-used cup in it.The bathroom was also huge, with separate shower and toilet rooms. It had a free standing deep soaking tub which I liked. However, the toilet room upon first arriving, although appeared clean, had a very unpleasant smell to it!! That ruined my entire mood & trust for the quality of the entire bathroom from the begining. The housekeeping staff attended to it as soon as I complained, but.. it quite didn't get me back my trust for the quality of the room.The Club located at the top of the hotel, was also very crowded. The staff tried to accomodate their guests as quickly as they could. But again, you will need to wait in line to get in. And due to the rush, although no one asked us to leave early, it didn't feel fair/ comfortable to take too long to enjoy your meal and the beautiful view that surrounds you as much as you would have liked.The gym on the other hand, was surprisingly not as crowded. The view again was very nice, with modern, wide array of quality equipment. The staff there was excellent & friendly, from welcoming and guiding you through the locker room, until bidding you goodbye when you leave.The complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport is fantastic and helpful. And their free luggage storage service before and after check-in, is also very helpful.But overall, though the experience was nice, it didn't captivate us enough to want to come back again. The hotel is too large to the point that you can get frustrated finding your way through it. We spent more than 15- 20 mins trying to find our way to the Gardens by the Bay, which was located just next to the hotel. Due to the complicated entrances and exists, we ended up going in circles for so long, until we finally found the correct exit to get to the Gardens. By that time, we had lost most of our energy and enthusiasm to explore the garden. Overall, MBS has a lots to offer for a wide range of customers, not just their guests. This can make it appealing to certain clients, but the same can drive away others. The hotel is more like a city on its own rather than a luxury hotel which can provide a personal luxury experience to its guests. For us, that personal luxury touch is what we look for, for the kind of money we pay.",176
MBS,3,“One word... overrated”,"Despite whatever star ranking this hotel 'officially' has, the Marina Bay Sands is in reality just a 3 star hotel with 4 star views and a novelty pool. The rooms are not bad, but very standard for a 3 star hotel other than having a nice view of muggy and dirty-watered Singapore. The Pool on the roof is a nice novelty but it is overcrowded, unheated and full of screaming kids (who still end up in the 'no kids' pools and baths). There's an annoying photographer and the food they bring you out on deck looks nice, but tastes very average for the money you pay. Check-in and check-out is far too busy, sometimes you have to wait for the next lift due to overcrowding and everything is far too expensive. The location is pretty good, but there are MUCH better hotels to stay at with nicer rooms, better views, better facilities, MUCH better service and cheaper! You're better off staying somewhere a bit nicer (and cheaper) and just buying a roof pass for the novelty.",318
MBS,3,“Beautiful hotel especially the Sky Park - but lost my engagement ring in the room.”,"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands early Feb for 4 nights. We found that the hotel was extremely crowded, but possibly it was due to the chinese new year season. There are many shops (mainly branded goods) and food downstairs. The MRT station is also downstairs. The room was nice, spacious, clean and had a beautiful view of Garden by the bay. We travelled with a 5 years old and a baby and we were comfortable.Having said that - the room that we stayed in (#3267) had a really loud gushing of water sound every morning at around 7.45 am for about 5 minutes or so. It didn't disturb our sleep as we were all awake early, but it would definitely annoy a lot of people, as it was really loud. Secondly, I lost my engagement ring in the room. I had put them on the table before bed and forgot to put them back on in the morning. We went up to the pool and then realised that I didn't have my ring on. We quickly went back about 2.5 hours later, the room had been cleaned and the ring was missing. Looking back I should have insisted to meet the person who cleaned our room, instead of just calling up house keeping. They kept telling me they found nothing in Lost and Found, but why would they? The ring wasn't lost, it was sitting on the table. But of course it was my words, against theirs (if you know what I mean). As you can imagine, I was upset and flustered and after looking around everywhere in the room and calling house keeping numerous times, we decided to leave it, as we didn't want it to further ruin our holiday!we took the complimentary bus to the airport, which was nice.so overall, it would have been a good stay if I didn't lose my precious ring. ;(",50
MBS,2,“Amazing pool - everything else pretty ordinary”,"Apart from the pool (which is incredible), everything else is sub-standard. I would suggest only spending one night here max - enjoy the pool then go somewhere else to truly relax. The service is really bad, the location is out of the way, and value for money is very poor.",362
MBS,1,“Adding Insult to Injury at Marina Bay Sands”,"A follow-up to a previous review of the problems encountered at this hotel. I wrote a review on Feb 18th about the terrible service etc.. that we received at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The management posted a note that they were following up, and I provided all of the relevant details as requested immediately. However, since then, Heard Nothing!!! Just like the hotel, all flash, no substance, no customer service what-so-ever. They respond as though they are following up, but do nothing. So my review now - 1 Star for the hotel... only because I can't give it the NO STARS that it deserves. Sky Park is good - that should rate a 4!Original Review:We stayed for 2 nights at the MBS at the end of a week-long Singapore trip. The only way to see/swim in the pool is to be a guest at the hotel. I had booked a quite expensive Premium City View room in Tower 1-2, only to be told upon check-in that none of those rooms were available and they had to put us in a garden view room in Tower 3. Check-in took over 40 minutes and then once we got to our rooms (a very long walk through the 3 towers) our rooms keys didn't work. We got that sorted out and then after arriving back to our room at 10:00 at night, we realized that they hadn't made up the sofa bed for our daughter, and upon calling were told it would be a 20-30 minute wait for someone to come and bring bedding for the sofa. I complained and asked for my message to be given to the manager....no response from the management or any indication that the staff ever forwarded my message. Overall, given that the room was over US$550 per night, the level of customer service was shocking... Additionally, there were problems with the elevators being broken, we had to take the service lift to get to our room after a very long wait at the elevator banks. As for the area, it is out of the way and a schlep to get anywhere else in the city from this location.",173
MBS,2,“The View is fantastic - but that is it...”,"After staying in Singapore many times at different 5 star hotels - Marina Bay Sands definitely is not in the same class as the others. I had been informed from other friends who had stayed here that they had one of the worst check in's - this is so so true - for a so called 5 star hotel with 2331 rooms to have a check in desk in the main walk way on the ground floor with 4 check in staff... so after a 30 minute wait and being knocked into by all the sightseeing people and shoppers we finished the check in.The room was clean, good facilities but nothing more than on par with a holiday inn except the cost. The hotel as a whole has no personalty compared to other options in Singapore - so if you are not bothered about going for a swim in a cold pool on the roof of a hotel then i would recommended looking at the Shangri-La as this is a 5 star hotel.",390
MBS,3,“Poor service but a must go for the view”,The wait for service is so long they need to increase reception to cater the amount of guest they have but the receptionist were helpful but concierge doesn't really help you much for small things such as changing key cards. the room was nice with the toilet and shower seperate with a bathtub as well and twin washing basins. loved the view i got since i asked the receptionist for a nice view which she kindly got arranged for me. There's also a mini lounge in our bed room. Now for the great parrt the pool ! It was a a very nice view love it i would probably go at the time i went at 6:20 ish in the morning. Theres no crowd and you get the best of two worlds the night view and the dayview - gorgeous and you can swim which ever section you want cause no one is there to make you feel embarassed about taking photos and all but then again everyone is taking photos when at the pool and there's lifesavers there early in the morning already but its really cold but worth it singapore is pretty humid. There is part two and that would be the spa/jacuzzi opposite of the pool and its warm and bubbling a way with a push of a button the end of the jacuzzi it was so relaxing after the cold pool swim and you enjoy a different view - the harbour view in comparison to the city view. There is a cool kids lounge that parents can sit and enjoy but definite recommend to bring your swimmers for the experience cause mum regretted for not going for a swim in the morning with me . Shopping is pretty price but I got lost so easily to find the store but must experience it with the water show there as well. Also had room service but it was part of the experience. the food was overprice but the serving is big and staff were very polite and addresses you by Hello Ms. *** how can i help you?. But try to travel light or go there to be your first hotel cause the staff doesnt open the car door for you or open the door and luggage delivery will be delay so diy would be more efficient.,514
MBS,1,“aware of ur deposit! Lousy hotel indead! staffs with no reliable responsibilities and full of lies inside.”,"i had visited to marina baysands hotel on december 2012 to celebrate christmas with my fiance for 1night 2days staying in hotel this is the very very worst experience that i ever had with this famous worldwide hotel as people said. upon arrival, i had deposited certain amount of money as i had to use my debit card instead of credit card. the frontdesk counter staff told me that usually the deposit would return to me with 2 weeks of working days. as they were telling as if it's trustworthy.when i checked out from the hotel in next day, i double confirmed with the check-out counter staff again regarding this deposit. i was given the exact information. i had waited until 2013 january had passed, there were no emails or no paper letter received. i made multiple phone calls to the marina bay sands information counter to talk to the person in-charge of deposit issue. the phone line was transferred to the front desk (so-called in charge of deposit) everytime i made calls. they had put me on-hold for more than 20mins to let me talk to the in-charge. with understanding of peak hours, i had specially requested with the information counter to call me back as soon as possible once the person in charge was able to settle this issue with me. i had waited half of the working day, i did not receive any message or phone call from them. i just wondered how this staff was passing the information to her collegue when the customer requested or did the staff not care about the customer's request? next day, i had made phone call again, another staff told me that she had already sent urgent message to the bank to transfer my deposit as soon as possible and i was told to check again my account in next day evening. she promised me that she will make sure the bank transfer to me by next day which i did not receive as she said so. i was kind of full with disappointments and anger with this hotel services and wondered how they control their financial related issue. did financial manager pass their accounting exams, are they noticing customers'rights, are they aware of those policies about financial, are they competent enough to run this hotel while they couldn't able to settle even small financial matter? and why did all the staffs keep lying to the customer while they are not doing anything i had raised to settle, behind their fake smiles at the front desk and inside of the hotel, are they cheating the money? it may be a small amount of money, i do understand that i have my right to know whether they are returning or not returning deposit. even if they are not returning, i should know what the reasons are. i will never ever visit again to marina bay sands hotel again to such big hotel with bad image and strongly suggest the rest of travellers not to believe what the staffs say as all are full of lies.",332
MBS,3,“Too crowded to really unwind”,"Stayed for a night as part of our honeymoon repertoire. We heard so much about this hotel so wanted to try it. Expensive but you would expect that. First impression, like many other travelers, that the hotel was huge and the crowd, hotel guests + visitors, made the lobby look like an airport departure hall. Check-in took longer that we would have liked. Once we got the access cards it was a nightmare getting them to work, the elevators had the speed of a rocket, but only if you manage to get them to read the bloody card. The rooms were alright, massive bed, and our room was facing the Gardens by the Bay which was quite nice. That night we went up to the Infinity Pool and again were turned off by the crowd and the partying. The Sky Decks were something to behold but the awe lasted no longer than half an hour. For its price the room doesn't come with free breakfast, unless you get a Club Room. Went up to the Infinity Pool the next morning and it was less crowded. Pool was not heated and it was cold but who goes to MBS and doesn't try out the pool? The bakery down at the lobby in Tower 3 had excellent pastries at affordable prices with great coffee. What I liked most about the hotel was its vicinity to the Shoppes, a great shopping destination for me because it had many specialty shops, not just high-fashion. Overall, MBS was so-so for me and I think my biggest problem with it was its sheer size. It lacks the warm hospitality, and that sense of belonging you sometimes get with superior hotels...it's a hit and miss most of the time isn't it?If you just want to test your fear of heights, just get a day tour to the Sky Deck at 20 dollars per head. No need to stay here. Unless you're dying to try out the pool of course.",111
MBS,1,“Avoid this place”,"There is a good view from the roof - but you can see it without staying in this dreadful property. I can think of no reason to stay in this hotel unless you want to use the casino.Check in utter chaos. You would think you were at the Chinese National Peoples Congress. Very noisy, very unpleasant.The electrics in the rooms are all messed up. Expect your curtains to open and close at random during the night. There is a balcony but no furniture to sit on it - probably because they don't want guests to see the jumpers who have lost it all on the tables.Many, many better options in Singapore.",390
MBS,3,"“Once, but not again”","You have to, don't you? That huge infinity pool on the roof, the amazing building, the vast choice of restaurants, and it all so cheap by European standards.We visited at Chinese New Year 2013, when the hotel was at its busiest; perhaps when it is quieter it is a different place.The room was great, the view fabulous, the bathroom all you would expect of a five star hotel. We then visited the pool. Entrance was a beaurocratic nightmare, we got wrist bands - are they really necessary? The pool was hopelessly busy, hardly any spare loungers. The pool itself was for me too cold and so busy it was impossible to swim. But then again, it would be, wouldn't it? The pool is relatively small and it's a huge hotel - the pool simply isn't big enough to cope during very busy periods and it seems that the management make no attempt to moderate the flow. We fled during a rain squall. And then to the lobby, for a delicious snack at the Deli. We had a fabulous sandwich and cake, but it was hard to find a seat, as it would be, given that there were only a dozen or so in the entire venue. I dined alone, as my husband was sleeping off the journey. I had a fifteen minute hike to find the natural burger restaurant Fraze, which I'd rate as only marginally better than McDonald's. The views en route were entertaining, fabulous jewellers outside the casino, the hotel organisation seems determined to keep your money one way or another. But I found the whole thing too big, too many shops, not enough organisation. The printed guides are route planners, it could all be so much better, but you have to remember you are in the midst of a vast money making machine.We found check in quick and efficient and express check out takes seconds. We breakfasted at the main restaurant - a vast choice of well cooked food, but maybe Cut on 57 is a better venue - it is a similar price.And then to the airport and the plane back home. My husband began to scratch on the bus back. He swears there were bedbugs. I cannot comment one way or another. But on my next trip, I shall probably stay at the Shangri La.",331
MBS,2,“Pool and Sky Park-AWESOME. Hotel - Not so much”,"We stayed for 2 nights at the MBS at the end of a week-long Singapore trip. The only way to see/swim in the pool is to be a guest at the hotel.

As for the area, it is out of the way and a schlep to get anywhere else in the city from this location. My overall opinion, book a cheap room (as they are going to put you in a cheap room anyway, from what I've seen in the other reviews) and just go for 1 night and use the pool/skypark for the entire day, then switch to a much more area/customer service hotel for the rest of your stay. We were at the Fairmont for most of the week and while the rooms were a bit dated, they were very clean and the customer service was amazing!!!",81
MBS,2,“Don't bother”,"Yes the roof is nice to visit and the view is great but really there are many better hotels in Singapore. And if you do visit the roof try to not to go to the bar at night - very cheesy and full of girls throwing up when we were there.Service is generally bad - slow check in and check out, unhelpful staff at the roof restaurants/bars. The rooms are basic and the fit-out feels very cheap and tacky.One to avoid.",530
MBS,2,“What a let-down”,"We had been looking forward to staying here to take the edge off returning home after a long European holiday, nothing like blowing some serious cash on 3 nights in a swanky hotel to break up a long flight home. And we're talking serious cash, over $600 a night which is normally enough to guarantee a wonderful stay, enough to make it worthwhile not blowing all your money on business class flights.But first the good bits. The pool is as impressive as it looks, taking in sweeping views of the city and lovely for a dip on a hot Singapore day; and the presence of a child free section was a well appreciated touch. In addition the service of the staff was also exemplary, nothing to fault here.The first thing we noticed was the video they play on the bus from Changi airport. Grainy and rolling on the screen, this was the worst VHS you ever rented and then some. Not terminal, but a bit off for a 5 star that should be taking pride in all aspects of their brand. On arrival we easily found the \VIP\"" check in room and checked into our club room without incident.The room was huge, with amazing views and all the normal 5 star amenities but it wasn't long before we started noticing that things were not quite right in this barely 3 year old property. In a nutshell the place is falling apart, being seriously let down by their housekeeping and maintenance teams. Dodgy wallpaper patching, rusty taps, mould, peeling skirting, lots of little things (see attached photos) that just made the whole place feel a little bit crap (not the word we actually used) especially given the premium price point. I dread to think how bad they'd let things get in the back of house.Having stayed in club rooms at other properties we were expecting the Club Lounge to be the usual oasis of attentive service with lots of food and drink to boot. What we found was a 20 metre queue of wearied looking guests, waiting for their brief session in the food and watering factory. We ventured out for lunch...Everything about this place is mass produced, from the tacky wrist band you're required to wear all day to access the pool, to the epic queues at reception, this is mass tourism at its worst. After 24 hours of disappointment and feeling ripped off at every turn, we checked ourselves out early and head over the bridge to the Ritz Carlton. This was more like it, and we saved ourselves a few hundred for our troubles.This place trades on its pool, and punters so blinded by it that they don't see that they're forking out 6 star rates for a solidly 3 star property. Good for them, but those looking for that occasional forbidden treat that is a true 6 star experience would do better to have a quick look at the pool and then head elsewhere.Our Ritz room had a magnificent view of Marina Bay Sands, an impressive structure in anyone's book. It was also without doubt the best way to take in the place, from a discreet distance.""",76
MBS,3,“en masse luxury ...”,"Another new icon in Singapore. Amazingly designed luxury hotel with a stunning rooftop infinity pool overlooking the city's CBD area. As the country's attraction, it draws many visitors to the premise. Too many visitors in fact, especially if you're a guest wanting to enjoy the hotel's pleasures without fighting with the crowd. The rooms are spacious. Stunning city and sea views. A selection of in-house fine dining restaurants.The new 'Gardens by the Bay' is next door.",137
MBS,3,“Marina...Bay...Sands”,"I rate it average because its a 5 star hotel with terrible check in check out... total caos there(which i hope its changed as we were there just few months after it opened officially and not to forget the leaking air condition for which we had to ask for a room change), apart from that liked pretty much everything about it....huge bedrooms with huge bathrooms,lovely pool with great view and the room that we were assigned was something our kids enjoyed as they could watch the light show that happens just outside in front of the bay for which we were asked to pay extra over and above the already expensive rates during check in.But all in all not bad.PS: my date of travel has been put as march 2012 as there was not options before that!",886
MBS,1,“amazing building but the worst service ever. will not return to this property again.”,"Two premium rooms were booked but due to overbooking, deluxe rooms were given instead even though the rooms were already being paid with credit card. In fact, deluxe rooms were of a smaller size of the premium rooms. However, the Front Office Agent who checked us in claimed that they are of the exact same size, while the other FO agent claimed that only difference in between is the bathtub. Information was so confusing, then we asked for meeting the manager. The FO agent who checked us in claimed himself as a manager but actually he isn't. After more than half an hour of registration, things were so called settled yet unsatisfied.The FO agent claimed that both rooms were ready, however, when we arrived one of the rooms, the extra bed just came out from the back office. The key card for the other room was not working, so we called the Guest Service department to kindly send the correct key cards upstair. One lady brought her own master key and opened the door for us, and when asked about the correct key cards, we were told to call the Guest Service by ourselves because they could not handle this situation. (But actually before that the Guest Service said there will be somebody bringing you up the correct key). The bellman brought up the correct key card, and as we found that the in-room amenities were different from the other room even though we were paying the same prices, we asked for the amenities that were missing to be brought up. Again, the bellman was not empowered and told us to call the Guest Service by ourselves. Housekeeping department was quick in respond to guest requests. But regarding the communication between the Guest Service and the In-Room Dining department, it was disastrous. Several calls were made to the Guest Services department, various staff picked up the phone and said they will send some colleagues up to check against the room that had items being missed. Still, after half an hour until 11.30pm, there were no people responding the request and was being ignored. Until 11.40pm, after 40 mins the first call was being made, finally someone responded which was already too late. The reason for their mistake was because there was a room move before we checked in, and they did not check the room properly before giving to us, leading to a difference in amenities placement. Besides, one phone operator tried to explain why my situation was not being responded even though I had made several phone calls. The reason she gave me it's because their hotel is so big, the department is huge and they have so many staff, so that's why...During the last phone call made, I asked about the breakfast opening time. The phone operator named three restaurants with opening times (in Tower 1 and 2). The FO Agent who checked us in informed us that there are only two restaurants located in Tower 1 and 3 for breakfast. My family called also, and was being told that there are two restaurants located in Tower 1 and 2 with different opening times from all of the above. There is no communication in this hotel, and even within a department. It is hard to trust any of the staff here.The next day, of course, we talked to the front desk manager regarding the situation for the previous night. She then showed us the proper premium rooms before we decide to move in. It wasn't only one bath tub extra in difference between the deluxe rooms. The bed room of the premium room was a double size of the deluxe one. In the deluxe rooms, the extra bed is placed right next to the window, while in the premium rooms, after placing the extra bed, there is still a big and spacious living room next to it. What the FO Agent described was totally different from what we have seen, they were not giving proper information to the guests.I was asking the manager for the correct information regarding the restaurants location and opening times, the 4th version was given...Everything was fine after room moved, until the shuttle service to the airport. The bellman told us to stand inside the indoor waiting area before the shuttle bus is ready. Once we got in, a group of people were being seated, and they were blocking seats for their friends. They did not let others to take over the empty seats even though the scheduled time had been passed. The hotel could not do anything to ask them putting away the bags. At the end, we have to get out of the bus due to this group and the bus left with many empty seats which we could have got in together. Car shuttle was eventually being arranged. We understand it was not the hotel's fault but the hotel could have arrange shuttle bus service with reservation, or at least with a ticket control, in order to maximise the seats and reduce confusion.It was a horrible experience since the beginning. We thought it would turn better but it did not. Staff was inexperienced, was not able to tell the correct information to the guests; totally not empowered. Only supervisor/manager can bring a fair service to the guests.",245
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands - Mixed experience”,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night on 18th December just to experience it and see if we would stay there in future. We did the booking at the last minute using 'Lastminute.com' as it was a late decision to stay one night.We are a family of 4 travelling so booked and paid online for a room with two double beds as indicated on the booking.When we checked in we were told that they actually did not have roomms with double beds or twin beds, and actually the rooms marked as such were only king size double. They just kept saying that a king single is what is meant by a double/twin bed. I explained that in many years of travelling we had never had this type of issue before, anyhow after about an hour of arguing they agreed to upgrade us to a room with one king bed and a double fold out sofa at no extra cost after more arguing.So basically I would not trust this hotel to honour bookings despite having it confirmed in writing on type of bed.The hotel has a great pool, cannot argue with this.However location is a little away from all other parts of Singapore except their own extensive, but expensive shopping complex. I figure it is good if all you want to do is gamble at casino, and lay around the pool.After being there once, would not bother to consider the hotel in future.",114
MBS,3,“Over rated”,"This landmark hotel is famous because of the rooftop infinity pool and has some of the best sky-top views of singapore. Being so heavily promoted in north asia, because of the casino , it seemed to be the busiest place in singapore for chinese new year, with prices to match. Some good deals can be had out of season, and the location became more attractive with new MRT station and gardens by the bay. Rooms are large but basic (and the a/c blows into the kids bed). Valet service caters well for locals wanting a night away but if you want real service and charm in singapore try others such as capella, shang, oriental.",710
MBS,3,“marina bay sands singapore”,"My wife and I booked into the Marina Bay Sands hotel from the 2/1/2013 to the 10/1/2013.It was our second trip to Singapore and looked forward to staying at this hotel being the newest and most impressive looking in Singapore up to now.First impressions were rather disappointing. The sheer chaos at the front of the hotel with cars, taxis and coaches coming and going was simply unbelievable. It reminded us of a busy railway station at the end of a working week. We’ve been to many 5 star hotels throughout Asia but never saw anything like this before. Once inside the hotel things did not improve. The pedestrian traffic was never ending and it felt as though we were walking along the chaos that is Orchard Road. Because we were booked in a suite there was a VIP booking-in area for guests which in itself left a lot to be desired. Small and noisy beyond belief it was really quite difficult to actually hear what was been said to us as the place was packed with people virtually rubbing shoulders with each other and all talking at the same time. A very disconcerting situation if one is used to more quieter situations when checking in. By comparison for example the Centara Grand at Bangkok and the Hyatt Regency in Hong Kong stood out as more civilised and sophisticated in their checking-in process. So far we were totally unimpressed but a pleasant surprise awaited us as the suite turned out to meet all of our expectations. It was big and spacious with excellent views of the harbour from one side and the Skypark from the bathroom. No complaints at all in this regard.Our package included breakfast which turned out to be daily let-down. The eating area whilst having spectacular view of the city skyline and the infinity pool etc. was small and cramped for a hotel of this size. The food was so-so. We’ve had much better elsewhere and absolutely no comparison for example to the breakfast feasts at the Hyatt Regency HK. The poor and limited selection of dishes was disappointing and the bacon strips were so hard that you could saw through a piece of wood with them. The wait for a table each morning was also really annoying and whilst waiting one morning we were told that we could go to the alternative breakfast restaurant at Sky on 57 as it was part of our breakfast package. We tried it once and ended up being charged $S89.45. Sky on 57 turned out to be as bad as the other breakfast area except that the air conditioning was so high that we nearly froze to death. We ate quickly and left in an effort to thaw out. I did raise the matter of the additional charge for breakfast with the hotel by email on my return home but no response was ever received. This is really unacceptable for this hotel as one would have expected from the client liaison manager a quick reply, an apology and a refund of money. No such luck. Guests beware what you are told as the advice may not match the reality.The casino in the hotel needs a special mention. 3 security checks and the production of a passport every time you want to go into the casino, or out for that matter, is ridiculous and frustrating. Once inside we were not impressed. Smoking is allowed in the casino and the sight of cigarettes and ash overflowing from the ashtrays meant that cleaning did not take place on a very regular basis leaving the inevitable stench of tobacco lingering around the poker machines making it very unhygienic and unpleasant. We have been to better casinos.Overall whilst people may bleat ad nauseam about how spectacular the view is from the top of the hotel one assumes that you cannot simply stare at a view for the duration of your holiday and whilst the hotel may have a few things going for it, such as for example, the connection to the Marian Bay shopping complex and the Skypark, there are too many negatives to take into account and it is not the hotel that we would ever go back to. We have been to better hotels.",255
MBS,3,“Not as exciting as you would expect”,"If you plan to make a trip to visit singapore and take the sights of the city then you should look for another hotel. If you plan to spend your time at the casino then this is the hotel for you. The hotel is right next to the MRT but expect to take 2 to 3 transfers to get to anywhere. The hotel has all the standards of a 5 star hotel. The view from the roof top and the pool is amazing but unless you spend all your time at the hotel there are better options.Check in waiting time was a bit long about 10 minutes in line., but I guess you can expect that from a huge hotel. The check in itself was fast. We check are bags in when we arrive at our taxi but it took close to an hour for the bags to get to our rooms again I think this is cause by not enough personal and too many travellers arriving at the designated checkin time.The room itself is nice and clean. The view is nice. The celebrity restaurants are quite good, breakfast is a bit pricey. There is a watershow every evening which we stumble upon it would have been nice if it was advertise. There is enough to shop, eat, see and do around the area, but if this is your first trip to Singapore you probably want to see the sights.Overall an average experience with the price you pay there are better hotels in the city.",691
MBS,1,“Terrible ever”,"Did not expect that MBS will be so terrific in providing the service. It was our last night of the trip and not able to express how dissapointing it was. Nightmare has started from the point of check in time where colleague was not willing to assist. May be, that was one of his bad days, which we understand can happen, however this should not have been refected on guests. Christopher ( colleague at the reception) has been unhelpful and you could notice the attitude in the face. In a robotic way kept repeating what he needed for the deposit and did not want to negotiate, even we had advised about it in a very clear way. At the end, room key has been given without providing standard information about Hotel and facilities, however clearly mentioned by him\ There is anyways nothing to explain since everything is blocked\"" Wow!!! No escort has been sent with us to the room, neither a standard welcome letter in it, at least where we could get an info. We had to go on a Hotel's website to read it. I dont think so that anyone would be pleased by this kind of tratment. next step was, to contact Duty Manager and provide the feedback of what has happened. Marvin - Service Manager was very nice and polite, approached personally with explanation and we understand, that mistakes can happen, as No one is perfect in this World, however no matter how Marvin wanted to convince us, nightmare did not stop.Next morning we came for breakfast to Club Lounge on 57th floor. We have been given a table outdoors with the nice view to harbour - one of the nicest things we had that day. However again were surprised with the Manager's attitude after hearing from us that we were not happy. He just simply said Ok and left. This is may be a real concern not only for ordinary colleagues, but for Management level as well, as what we understand if manager is approachng to check on guests' feedback- needs to make sure that he or she is being listened well and assisted, no matter whether its negative or positive feedback. And it seemed all guests have been treated like pass by passengers on a tram station. Dirty plates kept remaining on the table etc.On another note, we understand, Hotel has its great feature of Infinity pool on 57th floor with amazing view, Casino, Theatre and Shopping Mall, however just to mention, this is not yet a 7th Wonder of the World and there are a lot of Hotels around the world with great facilities and special features. And i feel sorry that we have chosen this Hotel for the last night of our trip, as the service we have got in Mandarin Oriental which is just a road across was Super Excellent and i believe people can barely comment on anything, as this is what you expect for the feeling \"" Home away from Home\""Last but not least, departure was one of the worst experiences, where we have arrived to airport without luggage. Reconfirming with Bell Desk on Level B and getting a luggage tag, colleagues still managed to leave our luggage back in the Hotel. Before entering the shuttle i personally reconfirmed with the colleague who assisted us and got a reply back\"" Dont worry Mam, luggage will be loaded\"" and here we go! Shuttle bus driver was surprised himself that how it could happend being with 6 people on board and 6 pieces of luggage, they have managed to forget. It is a clear sign, that with the amount of arrivals and departues in huge Hotel, this is simple, for incident to happen easily and have a negative impact on guests. We tried to reach Hotel and sort out the problem and finally luggage arrived to airport after 1.5 hrs which means, we were about to miss the flight since we were last people for check in. Noone could give a proper answer for the question- \""What if we would have missed our flight!\"" Definetely not Marina Bay Sands for any future visits.""",150
MBS,3,“Mass luxury tourism”,"Hotel is amazing. But what you are paying for is essentially the roof-top pool area. Which is amazing. Swimming in the infinity pool and looking out (down) over the skyline of Singapore feels a bit like flying. Otherwise, this is mass luxury tourism in its purest form. Service is politely phrased but very impersonal (soooo many guests) and rushed.The basic (\Deluxe\"") rooms are very standard for being 5*. Nice and comfortable but nothing special. Huge balcony which is unfurnished! Very strange. Free shuttle-bus from airport is great.Disappointment: fruit fly in the rolled up salmon on the breakfast buffet got us a very politely phrased apology from the manager (and yes, it can happen in any hotel), but we still had to pay for the breakfast. When such things happen at a 5* hotel, the breakfast should have been free. Recommendation:Stay there to enjoy the pool, otherwise choose a smaller hotel.""",179
MBS,1,"“Rude Staff, Overpriced”","This place is definitely not worth the money. The hotel is full of people taking photos all over the places and it is very crowded. It is more of a tourist spot than a 5 star hotel. Staff are very unkind especially the bouncer guys on the rooftop bar beside the swimming pool. They treat you as if you are their kids or something. The way they talk is way below average and very forceful. In addition, the man checks room keys in front of the swimming pool has the same type of manner as well. Nothing special about the room; the view didn't meet my expectations also. Considering the money I paid for, I am very unsatisfied. I know this is a very famous hotel and I agree that the building itself is quite amazing (only because it is huge). But staying here is really not worth the money. I recommend you to just stop by the hotel and look around without staying here. Summary: MBS? One huge hotel with rude staff. Don't expect to be treated here.",194
MBS,3,“Average Room and Experience”,"The Marina Bay Sands Building looks nice and all, but that was about it. I personally find that MBS is less convenient compared to other hotels such as Pan Pacific Hotel, Ritz Carlton, etc...The bed was comfortable but there were some strange stains on the bed sheets and pillow covers. Electricity also \trips\"" and resets when you change the air-con fan speed or open-close the curtain controlled by switch. When it trips, the bathroom lights gets switched off and the TV gets switched off too. Even though I stayed in a Premier room on the 25th storey, my view was blocked by beams and plants. The sky pool was very crowded, and not very spectacular to me. Our bathrobe and towel were almost stolen by other hotel guests but we managed to stop them, so becareful of your personal belongings when you go for a swim. The lift might also bring you down to the hotel lobby when you were hoping to get back to your room after a swim; Some card problem. Overall, I wouldn't say this place isn't good but there are other hotels nearby that is more worthy of your money.""",405
MBS,2,“Long Walks. Long queues. Crowded mediocrity”,"Claimed to have 2,561 rooms it should not then come as a shock to find a lobby more akin to a crowded shopping centre than any hotel I have been to.There are, seemingly, always queues at the check in and check out counters where staff seem harassed and guests rudely impatient to drop their bags and lose their money in the casino.Check in time is officially 3pm but that doesn’t stop the hagglers from trying to muscle their way in early. However at 3pm the cacophony seems to take the hotel by surprise and the queues grow longer and check seems so tediously painful.Dropping one’s car at Tower one and being told to check in at tower three affords the guest a long walk through the atrium resembling a busy bus station with bags and suitcases dragged left right and over everyone else.Make it to the room and yes, the sea view is nice, but the room clinical in its bland mediocrity. A weak selection of channels on the television, a balcony without furniture (frightened the casino losers will jump?) and a decor already looking dull and uninspired.With the bed at one end of the room and the electric switches for the curtains at the opposing end, it is hardly conducive to convenience. The closed curtains opened by themselves three times in the one night I had the misfortune to stay there – a bizarre and ghostly experience if nothing else.The swimming pool is as good as it looks in the air brushed pictures. However, once experienced with what seemed like a full meeting of the Chinese politburo crowding the pool, there was little space for any leisure, let alone swimming.Another long queue for breakfast was not worth the wait.I cannot, as you may guess, conscionably recommend this hotel - there are so many more in Singapore better in facilities and value.If you want to go to the casino – its perfect for you.If you have a family - don’t waste your timeIf you are a businessman only stay there if your meeting is in the expo / conventions centre otherwise it is inconvenient and easily bettered elsewhere.In the 24 hours I was there, on crutches with a leg in plaster, only one member of staff noticed and asked if any assistance was needed - thank you Jason. The rest were apparently so taken up with marshaling the hoardes that nothing else could be seen",1201
MBS,3,“Room number is the most important thing; too large for its own good.”,"Every year we finish our holiday in Asia in Singapore. This year a lot of things went different than planned (perhaps the ’13 played a part in it). We did manage to spend one night in Singapore. Our favourite hotel is The Scarlett in Singapore. For a change we took the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The main reason was curiosity because we return to Singapore every year we saw it being built; already open since 2011 it was time to experience it. However we already expected the worse having stayed earlier that month in the Venetian in Macau.We had booked a room with city view and lounge access. Those things do not come cheap with $600 a night (even for Singapore this is quite high) but then again we wanted to experience the hotel. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel although we were offered complimentary coach. We cannot comment on this coach; we just have something in general against it and a ride with a taxi is only like 15-20 Singapore dollar.When we arrived at the hotel a bell boy greeted us and took our luggage and gave us a claimtag. This experience was so much better than the Venetian where you just had to walk around with you luggage yourself. We proceeded to the check-in counter and as it was 10:00 our room was not ready yet. Now the Marine Bay Sands has this strange policy of check-in after 15:00 and check-out before 11:00. As our flight the next day was in the evening we asked if we could have a late check-out. We were offered 13:00 as a maximum; any later would mean paying half to full price of the room we booked (this while we only wanted to stay until 15:00 or 16:00).We were offered access to a refreshment room. We entered the room and we a little in shock: there were like five families inside this room (more a transformed suite). People where snoring, children were crying. There was one toilet and one bathroom with shower and bath. The whole room felt like being at the budget terminal in Kuala Lumpur. This gave us not a good impression. As we were promised to be called when the room was available (it would be around 12:00) and we really did not want to spend one more minute in the refreshment room we went to the city. We came back around 13:00 and having not being called we decided to ask for the room. Then we found out that we actually had to be in the VIP-lounge for check-in/out as this was part of our room. This was a different world: we got straight away access to the Lounge club at the 57th floor, internet access and we were given a upgrade to an Orchid suite. The room would be ready well before three. Again we gave our phone number. Also check-out for the day after was changed to 14.00 while the staff member at the “normal” check-in said anything after 13.00 is impossible and will cost you money.Now the hotel was flooding with guests. We really felt sorry for the people who had to use the normal check-in as the rows were longer than that of people waiting for immigration at the airport. The whole hall downstairs looked modern but at the same time: especially with so many people coming in felt like we were at an airport. We went upstairs and the view was breath taking; seeing the infinity pool ending where the city starts is a unique feature. However at the same time the other 2000+ guests also thinks like that. It was so busy we just walked to the lounge. We had a drink in the lounge and the coffee was quite good. Later high tea was served (just a buffet) of which all the food was at best average. This was a surprise as the hotel portray itself as having six of the best restaurants in Asia / world. No matter how many times we contact the check-in our room was not available. Only at 15:10 we got our room; so about five hours after we arrived at the hotel. But then again the hotel stated check-in after 15:00 we guess they have to follow rules.The suite had views of both the harbour and the city: better actually then going to the 57th floor as here you can enjoy it while not being disturbed by the big pool party upstairs. The suite had everything you can think of. There was even a Nespresso machine but later that day we found out that it was broken as it could not puncture through the capsules.The minibar is the most atrocious you can think of. Even the staff member that explained the room to us warned stay away from the minibar. If you just as lift a bottle it will be charged straight away to your room. So cooling your own drinks is not an option (unless you may ask housekeeping to empty it for you perhaps).After finally being able to rest for a while we went to the lounge for a cocktail. As there are just too many guests in the hotel you have to mention your room number so the staff can see what you are entitled too and actually who you are. The whole cocktail event seemed for a lot of guests the time to fill their bellies with the “free” snacks and drinks. It felt more like we were in a bad all-inclusive resort than an exclusive lounge. There is also no check on the way how people dress. The hotel recommend smart casual but does not enforce it. So you see tank tops, bikinis etc. We ordered room service for supper after we came back from the city from dinner. This was fulfilled quickly and the quality was actually good. The next day we had breakfast in the lounge. It was busy (although not as busy as on the first floor where the rows were long for breakfast) and again it did not feel exclusive. The quality was very average: my fiancée almost throw up on a bad piece of fish. The mango juice clearly came from a package with a bad metal taste to it. Actually only the coffee was good.As we could not get the late checkout we stored our luggage and went to the city (btw valuables can be stored for free at the business center in a locker). Upon return we wanted to change clothes and perhaps have a shower. The refreshment room was busy: with one shower and one toilet we gave up on the idea of having a shower. We changed and quickly left.Our recommendation: book a hotel in Singapore and stay for one night in the Sands if you want to be able to swim in the pool (just hope it is not too busy). If you just want to see the view it is better to buy the access to the 57th floor. The hotel is too large and unless you do not mind being treated as a number and served very average food it is better to be avoided.",168
MBS,1,“MBS stands for Mostly Bulls*** service”,"This is our 1st stay at MBS and this is the worst hotel experience I have ever had in Singapore, and, I visit Singapore every 2 months. The service is so impersonal and I had an issue with my room not being made between 10 am and 2 pm when I was out of the room and the \make my room' sign was lit up. Once I got back to the room at 2PM I complained and wanted to speak to the manager. I spoke to many staff over many call and was each time told that the manager would call me - this never happened - I guess the manager is too busy and really don't care and give a damn about guests - after all MBS has already ripped us off.However, housekeeping kept on sending someone to make our room. Now, if I am in the room, I do not want anyone making my room !!Never staying at this lousy hotel again.Staying 28-30th Jan Rm 3285""",174
MBS,1,“Don't bother”,It has everything and more that you'd want in a hotel except soul checking in is hectic the lobby is more of a train station then a hotel lobby its basically a mall with rooms and if your thing is shopping look no further but if you enjoy the peace and quiet of a 5 star hotel don't bother .the pool admittedly is amazing a pool strutting 3 skyscrapers on the 57 floor is spectacular .although sharing it with hundreds of people flashing cameras while loud rhythmic music is playing resembles more of a Disney experience pools were meant for relaxation but this pool is made for partying which again is great if that's what your interested in .even the mini bar is automated although practical gives a feeling of cheapness this is conveyer belt tourism at elite prices stay away except if your into casinos shopping or mass populated pools . That and cold room service I guess the distances that the staff have to cover are to challenging for any trolley warmer.,73
MBS,3,“Impersonal don't bother with Club”,"This hotel is too big and because of this the service is very poor. If you book a Club room don't expect the sort of facilities you are used to. The Club itself is a sterile cafe, no couches to lounge in, no personal service, you even have to queue and wait for a table. Rooms are spacious and well appointed but it lacks the personality of other 5 star hotels. Never again",74
MBS,1,"“Overpriced, not gonna stay here again”","one of the worst hotel i stay , ridiculously overpriced , waited 2 hours just to check it ,still need to pay for carpark(S$12 ) How ridiculous is that even u r staying at the suite at the hotel. totally overrated, suite is just bigger with totally no wow factor. pool is overly crowded , cannot even find a place to suntan, . dun waste ur money on this hotel , look else where.",159
MBS,2,“Overated”,"The only reason I stayed in this hotel was because of the infinity pool which i find is a given when coming to Singapore. Without this, Singapore doesn't really have much to offer as a whole.Check-in time begins at 3pm and i arrived about 430pm. My room was still not ready yet and i had to wait another hour before it would be. Due to the inconvenience, we were given a late check-out. A really nice offer BUT i can almost guarantee that they give late check-outs to almost everyone hence why our room was not ready and why others around us also had to wait another hour and were also given a late check-out for the inconvenience. I would recommend hiring more staff. The standard room price is also rather expensive.That was my real only pickle, but a big one at that.The infinity pool kind of made up for the terrible service.. Kind of. The view is amazing.",204
MBS,2,“Think Hard About This place”,"Once you get over the impressive structure and the roof top pool with views you are left with the practicalities. On one side the expressway passes and the noise at level 20 is too much for a hotel of this price. Having been moved to the 46th on the otherside, we found the walls paper thin. Passion oused through the walls on the first night to be replaced with screaming kids the next. we were able to hear running showers on both sides. Whilst the room is spacious the decor is a little sparse and cheap. The builkd quality is surprising. We only took breakfast at £25 a head. The \egg\"" station, operated by one man was constantly swamped with a long queue and other dishes such as bacon and scrambled egg often ran out with long delays to replace. Be careful not to be seated too far away from the serving action as the length of the restaurant is too much for the facilities provided. The table staff are also like wasps. they mistake good service with the constant need on their behalf to interupt your conversation or eating with the removal of items or demands for signatures. For the money, overall dissapointing.""",248
MBS,3,“Well worth a look”,"The structure and roof top is well worth a look in its own right. hotel rooms are also comfortable with all normal hotel features except a power point in bathroom ? All that structural planning and building only to leave out something so simple and necessary. Partner will have to use hairdrier in room not bathroom and the same for shavers etc ? Suprised they didnt think about this harder...Also for the size of the hotel check in desk is terrible, need to line up like cattle and they take at least 10min with each check doing who knows what... add that up with all the people lined up in front of you! Also check out was worst experience. Another line up and no one even at desk, just fitting one check out between a few check ins... what the ? i think they just think you should check out virtually with CC and god forbid you did it in person with a question on the account. So yes, you had errors on account and also wanted to pay some cash, some CC to empty our wallets of singapore money... maybe actually engage the guest at check in and check out , it is the basic principle in hotel hospitality as this is the only time you really get to see the customer.The veiw of the city is unbeatable from the roof, unique experience so high up in a city whilst being outdoors with plants, pools and sunbathing.",62
MBS,3,“great pool but that's about it.”,Fab pool and views but the hotel is sterile and very much feels like an airport lounge. Everything is extortionate and they try to make you pay a cover charge in the rooftop bar even though you are a guest. By all means check out the pool but there are far better places to stay with far better bars and restaurants nearby.,110
MBS,3,“Poor service but amazing views”,Rooms. Spacious and clean. Good tv's and wifi available. Tub had an amazing view over Singapore.Service. Ridiculously bad service. Slow and unfriendly. It seems like this 5* hotel is ran like a cheap chain hotel. Restaurants. Breakfast at the 57th floor had ofcourse great views but it lacked at the selection. Otherwise Marina Bay Mall has a variety of different restaurants to choose from. Other. Cab queues tend to get very long and the service at the Tower 1 side is very bad on the queues. Try taking a cab from tower 3 side.Try Fullerton or Mandarin Oriental instead. Might even be cheaper and for sure you'll get better service.,289
MBS,2,“Once was enough”,"I was looking forward to staying at this hotel for the unique experience. After staying here, I would say once was enough and would choose a different hotel before ever staying here again. My dissatisfying experience started upon check-in and did little to improve beyond that. I arrived over an hour after check-in time and my room was not ready. I was told to return in an hour so I did. It still took another 20 mins to check in. I waited in my room for my bags to be delivered. They were not so I called. One of my bags was delivered and then had to inform the bellman (for a third time) that I had a second checked bag. I went to the Club at 57 where the line was out the door. We waited for 30 mins or so before being told we could go down to Fuse bar. This took another 15 mins to sort out before being led to the bar. Once there, appetizers were brought around for each guest to grab for with their hands and no tongs. Breakfast in the morning at the club had a great view and mediocre food. I had to flag down a waiter to get an omelette made and he said it would be delivered to my table. After 15 mins, I had to ask my waiter for the status of my omelette. The tag line for the Club level experience is \it's good to be a the top.\"" Apart from the view at the Club, I would contend it is not. Overall, I found my stay at this hotel very disappointing and would not recommend. The staff is friendly but all seemed a bit poorly trained.""",136
MBS,3,“Overpriced and not that great”,"We booked 2 nights at the marina bay sands to catch the F1 race in Singapore. The best thing about it was location. We just walked to the race. It is located above a huge mall so shopping and eating In great restaurants is its big plus. And it does have a theater. Other than that, though, we didn't enjoy our stay. The hotel room was not that clean. The carpet felt dirty. We went to the pool and the staff guardng the guests entering was just plain rude (the ones inside were very nice). The hotel is so crowded that it lost all possible charm. And the price tag is too steep. Somehow,the hotel paled in comparison withfullerton, which we had stayed in a few months before. Now, Fullerton is a gem. Stay there instead.",37
MBS,1,“nice facilities but no customer service”,very overpriced and the most unflexible staff I have ever encountered. There are way better hotels in Singapore for a lot less money. They charge you for EVERYTHING and show zero flexibility when it comes to problems.,185
MBS,3,“Not a Place for Pure Relaxation!”,"We spent 3 nights here just after the New Year 2013 for a family vacation. Have read the reviews before our arrival, we did not expect much on the \personal touch\"" service level from this hotel. We also expected the place to be crowded, and it definitely was. Since our purpose for this trip was to be near the actions, we got what we wanted! Our young adult daughters were having a wonderful time shopping downstairs, so did the wife! There are other things to see near the hotel e.g. the Art & Science Museum, the Garden by the Bay, the Singapore Flier, etc.The reason I gave this place 3 points because I don't think it worth the price tag. We had to compete for everything starting from checking-in, getting into elevators, finding space at the sky park, getting seats at restaurants, checking out, getting our baggages from temporary storage, getting taxi to the airport. The rooms' furnishing are average. I have stayed in hotels with better equipped rooms and paid less.Overall, I think it is good for a once off experience to stay here.....""",238
MBS,1,"“nice facility, horrible service and policies. do NOT book this.”","Stayed in the Premier rooms for 3 days in jan '13.Nice facilities, everyone is staying there because of the deck up top with the pool.Overall, terrible service, staff is rude, feels like they are doing you a favor. If they walk and you walk towards them, they will bump into you unless YOU make way for THEM. They talk down to you, treat you like you're not a hotel guest, but an annoyance.Very bad service, way overprices for what it is.There are WAY better 5 star hotels out there, if not for the pool up top, I'd say this is not worth it at all.you can not walk around in the flip flops. You cannot wear shorts. You cannot walk around in a robe.If it's 8am or 9am and you happened to the by the pool on the deck (hmm... that' the only reason people are here!), then:a. you cannot eat breakfast at the Club unless you paid for the Club room. No exceptions.b. You cannot eat breakfast unless you're \executive member\"".c. You have to DRESS UP (by the pool?!?!?!) to eat breakfast in only other available restaurant..d. You cannot even order food by the pool, because they start at 10am !it's the only 5 star hotel where you can actually go HUNGRY because they REFUSE you... wow... how worse can it be?Mind you are paying $600+ per night.HORRIBLE POLICIESHORRIBLE STAFFruin the whole stay in this snobby hotel.""",428
MBS,1,“A Singapore icon with unfortunately absolutely no customer service”,"I made a booking back in April under a promotion that until this date is still available online called \American Express Inbound Offer\"" that promises a free upgrade to the next room category. When I checked in back then I was denied the only incentive of this promotion as the hotel was supposedely fully booked (which I dicovered was untrue later on). After counteless discussions back and forth via email, as the front desk is absolutely useless and you are always told there are no Manager available, I simply gave up and tried to make the most of the room I was given. The finish of the room looked very \""rushed\"" with few attention to details and lots of malfunctioning items (like the curtain and plugs). Since it is such an iconic hotel that has lots of other 'charms' I decided I should give it another try. As I was told the first time around I should enquire beforehand to ensure the \""upgrade\"" can be honoured I decide to make my booking via email and not through the website this time. 6 exchanges of messages later they book a room for me that is not even the rate they originally quoted and with complete disregard to the message history trail. Each message is addressed by a different person. When I point out the error about the rate, Instead of honouring the promises made in the earlier messages I receive a message simply saying \""Kindly disregard the reservation. We have cancelled it as we are unable to comfirm the upgrade upon reservation\"". No alternative date offered even though I had mentioned I was very flexible... The message sent is a clear indication that they absolutely do not need my business. Fair enough.The conclusion is that this hotel management is too big a machine to actually care about its customers as they know guests will book it anyway at least to enjoy the world famous pool. They sign each message with \""we appreciate that the personal touch counts and sowe like to give a personal reply to everyone who writes to us\"" except that due to the fact every single message is answered by a different Agent it does not give a big sense of 'personal touch'. Since I do not see any point to be \""fighting\"" (and really it should not reach that point but just be a breeze) with such a useless and impersonal booking machine I will indeed celebrate my special occasion at the Banyan Tree in Bintan who have a very different approach to Customer Service.""",95
MBS,3,"“Great Views & the Infinity Pool, shame about the impersonal feel”","There is no doubt that this hotel is spectacular and the check in staff were wonderful, but I couldn't help but feel that the hotel guests were swamped with camera crazy visitors who were on tours in mass to view the infinity pool and guests were not given any privacy. My other down side was the lack of seating for hotel guests when waiting to check into their room, (hotel reception area for guests only).The hotel is spectacular and is well worth staying in, but minor adjustments (above) could give guests a more personal feel.",120
MBS,2,“Better places to stay in SNG”,"The endless pool on the roof was cool, always very windy, make sure if you are having guests you ask for extra pool passes.The city side is the side of the tower you want, bay views are industrial and not very spectacular.The food and drinks at the very top were reasonably priced. It is close to the museum certainly worth a look.The Marina bay Shoppe is very expensive but convenient.It is almost a hassle to be assisted in the lobby, and keep in mind the daily service fees for the doors that will not be opened for you, the long check in line is a pain, but they do have live music and free sparkling wine to ease that pain.",388
MBS,2,“Act of racism?”,"I am Harshil Dalal (from Mumbai, India) had visited Marina Bay Sands on the 6th of January, 2013 for my honeymoon. Prior to checking in I had sent emails to the hotel requesting them if they could offer me any honeymoon benefits or even decorate my room at a cost for the least. These emails were not catered to. I still await a reply. Further, so that I dont waste my time doing the check-in formalities, I had done a web check-in through the check-in facility available on the Marina Bay website, which was never processed and I had to wait in the queue in the \VIP Lounge\"" for almost an half-hour before the check-in formalities took place. The room timing was 3:00pm and we were allotted the room by 3:30 - 3:45pm.Further, our experience at \""The Club\"" at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore was great other than few incidents which have deeply saddened me. One such incident is that my wife and me were waiting in the queue for breakfast and the stewardess called \""Michelle\"" was making a note of everybody and allotting tables. She was smiling and cheerful with all her guests. It so happened there was a group of people (asians) waiting before us, then us and behind us was an english couple. Michelle gladly wrote down the name of the group ahead of us and directed a table and then she seemed to have deliberately overlooked us and directly went on to help the english couple behind us with a wide smile and directed them to a table before us. And the overlooking, in my opinion, was not just oversight (it cant possibly be oversight), it was an apparent denial to acknowledge our presence. We wanted a table for 2 people and so did the english couple. When I asked Michelle about the table, she curtly told me that the tables were full when in front of my eyes my table was given to an english couple. I may not be able to convey so much in words but I would not be wrong to conclude it looked like an act of racism to put it honestly. It was completely disappointing and makes me think whether coming to Marina Bay was a mistake if we are insulted this way. Its very disappointing and deeply saddening.""",191
MBS,1,“Booooo”,"I choose this hotel because I have seen so many amazing photos of the pool and what a stupid decision that was. This place is terrible. In regards to the pool anyone can get up there not just hotel guests. The staff attempt poorly to stop non hotels guest from using the pool but fail miserably. Lets start from the beginning. Check-in took a ridiculous amount of time. The lobby is like a busy market. No one seems to know what they are doing.Finally check in and i have to figure my own way up to the room which you wouldn't expect from a hotel charging 500usd + a night for. Open the door and BOOM the stench. Unbelievable. This was a non smoking room but it stank of someone who had been smoking rats, it was putrid. So back downstairs to the market place / lobby. Wait in line for another 30 minutes. \Sorry no other rooms\""After arguing back and forth I got a different room. Nothing good about this place except the pool view but then it's ruined by the tour groups who wonder by to take their pictures.""",460
MBS,2,“Just Visit Don't Stay”,"Hotel itself is an iconic landmark in Singapore. Orchid Suite was large and well appointed. Bathroom roomy with decent product but towels scratchy. Bed was very firm and pillows thin and bedding nothing special; one of the pillow covers had dried blood on it. We requested an early check in because we were disembarking a cruise ship that morning and leaving that same evening at 3 AM so we wanted to change into our bathing suits and experience the famous infinity pool. After waiting for 45 minutes to check in, we were told that our room would not be ready until 1PM so we went upstairs to the 'club lounge' for orange juice and were told that we would be charged for our visit because our breakfast 'benefit' was for the following morning. The fact that we were leaving before breakfast began the next morning was just our bad timing... We were underwhelmed at the customer service throughout our short stay, to say the least. So we walked around upstairs at the pool (which was terribly overcrowded) for a few minutes and then decided to kill time in the casino and mall until our room was ready. It was 9:30 AM and all of the lounge chairs were taken with people hovering everywhere with nowhere to sit. The casino is also nothing special (reminded me of a low end Vegas gambling floor) but the mall was full of high end stores with good people watching. We returned at 1 PM and were told that our room was not ready yet and that it would not be available until after 3 PM (usual check in time.) We were given keys to a 'relaxing room' above the lobby. It was then that I realized that we had a smaller dedicated check in sight for suite guests and other VIPs. The line was LONGER there! So on we went to the relaxing room to get a cup of tea and read quietly away from the scrum. It, too, was totally full with families sleeping on the couches with sick children sniffling and crying. Very relaxing... Leftover paper cups half full of tea and coffee were laying around all over the counters. The drink station was completely out of tea bags so we left. Once we got into our room, it was nice and spacious with a great view. Later, we picked up our friends at the Mandarin Oriental and went to The Raffles Hotel for dinner and wished we had chosen either one of them instead. I was told that this hotel runs at 90%+ occupancy and not to expect much in the way of service. I should have listened. So take an hour and visit, just don't stay overnight at the hotel.",908
MBS,2,“Lousy Service”,"The service of this hotel was lousy from the moment we checked in. There were three towers and two reception areas. We booked Tower Two, and went to Tower One at first, and were told to go to Tower Two and Three Reception Area. It was quite a distance to walk if you have two kids and many luggages. Luckily my sister was driving us and we just drove to the other tower. It was very confusing at the check in area. Most people didn't know which counter to go to and there was no queue. It was a chaos. You just sort stand behind a person and hope to be helped when it is your turn. I saw one person lined up for a counter and was told to go to another counter when it was his turn. We lined up at a \safe counter\"" in the middle and was helped when it was our turn. The girl who checked us in was not a Singaporean and her level of English was below the average Singaporeans. She could tell us everything she wanted to say to us in clear English but she could not understand our questions clearly.After checked in, we went to our room. Be careful which elevator you take, there were many...different towers, lower floors, upper floors...The luggages were delivered quite promptly, and the housekeeping service boy came to set up the extra bed for our daughter efficiently. This was probably the most 5 star service we have received during our two night stay.We had a city view room on the 22nd floor of Tower Two. The window was expansive from top to bottom and left to right. The view was very impressive. There were little ballon looking things dotting the water in front of us. Other than that, the furnishing of the room and amenities were quite standard of a 5 star hotel.The hotel issued pool passes for the number of guests in the room. Going to the famous pool on the roof top took a bit of venturing about. We called the one stop service to find out exactly how to get there. We had to take three different set of elevators, first down to the lobby, then took a different elevetor to 55th (?) floor, then another one all the way to the top. I didn't get a feeling of being in an upscale and exclusive area. There were many tourists (or hotel guests) walking around, taking pictures, talking loudly. We were there one night hoping to get a bite to eat by the pool side and was told the food service for the pool side stopped at 7pm or 8pm (can't remember), hours before the pool was close.The second day we wanted to go to the Universal Studio with the free shuttle bus run by the Universal Studio. We went to the concierge counter the night before to ask about it. Nobody knew anything about it at first, then one person told us to go to the basement level at the \""Coach Terminal\"" to catch it. The next morning we promptly went to the Coach Terminal, and was told by the free shuttle does not go there. We have to go outside to where the public transport bus stop to catch the shuttle. By the time we figured out how to get there, it was passed the time the shuttle is supposed to pass by. So we just took a taxi to go. In any case, we found out, in order to take the shuttle, we had to prove we were tourists and were supposed to show our passports and landing cards which we clearly didn't carry around with us.We got really upset during our check out. We first lined up at a \""safe counter\"" again. This time there was a girl \""directing traffic\"". She asked us to go to the counter on the other side of the lobby. Mind you, the lobby is not a typical lobby of a hotel. It was really big, so you have to walk all the way across to the other side. There was already a man and two kids at the counter. We just stood behind them. There was only one girl at this counter. The guy was obviously asking some questions that a concierge should answer. Instead of directing him to the concierge, the girl just kept talking to him while we waited for 5, 10 and finally 15 minutes. We finally blew up and went to the traffic officer on other side, and complained to her. She quickly directed to a girl who wasn't helping anyone on the original side where there were many counters. We complained to the manager on duty about lack of a single queue, and was told they were not allowed to have a single queue by the management. I suppose that does not look too good for a 5 star hotel lobby but I suggest the executives to try the check in and check out process themselves and come up with an innovative way to smooth the process.All in all, this is a 5 star hotel with interesting architecture catered to mass tourists. If you come here and expect your typical 5 star hotel service, you will be disappointed. I think they expect the typical hotel guests to expect very low level of service. If I were to travel for business, I will never choose this hotel.""",256
MBS,2,“Over priced for what u don't get!”,"Unfortunately this hotel (being in Singapore) is run by drone staff reminiscent of a phone call to a call centre in Manila. The staff are mostly robotic and don't really listen to simple requests. The pool side cafe (the pool side being one of the major draw cards) served instant coffee with powered milk advertised as a latte/cuppuccino. The lobby bar - next best place to grab a coffee made their coffee pipping hot - totally undrinkable for 20 minutes. I was offered an ice cube by the barista to cool it down, in a latte!? After day 3, I gave up coffee altogether and went to the mall.The drinks at the pool are totally over priced. $18 for a rather small cocktail, $16 vodka tonic and $14 for a 350ml bottle of water. The food was average. Pool side dining: \cheese and ham panini with chips\"" arrived... was a plate with potato crisps emptied on to the plate from a crisps bag with a toasted bun, fluorescent orange cheese and a slice of processed ham. The crisps actually came with a side of tomato ketchup, apparently to dip the patotao chip into - who does that?? 5 star?The weather was lovely, 30 deg celcius. The pool however was 19 deg celcius. A real shame that its chilled, especially in the evening as the pool is open till 11pm and an evening float around the pool was out of the question, way too cold. A real shame. Would we stay at MBS again - no chance.""",171
MBS,3,“City view room is breathtaking - service needs work”,"We got a pretty good rate on a City View room (AUD$340) and were not disappointed with this hotel. The infinity pool was a wonderful experience, and being in close proximity to great shops and restaurants was handy. The room itself was well appointed and spacious, but the highlight was definitely the night view of Singapore waterfront and CBD from the room. Very peaceful and pretty. The casino downstairs is a bit of fun too, and if you're watching a show this would be the perfect location. The big downside was the service, which was only so-so. The hotel is so huge it seems they don't have enough staff / counters to assist you promptly, and there was about a 15 minute wait to check in. When our swipe card got deactivated, it was another 15 minutes and no apology from the reception staff to rectify the problem. Throughout the hotel the staff were not as friendly as your usual Singapore locals, so this is something they need to work on.",351
MBS,2,“Not so 5 star”,"When i stayed here last year, we were checked in the Premier Room. I WAS in awe of the size of the room, the bed and the bathroom AND the view from the window (city view) so i thought i would try stay there again someday despite such a hefty room rate.Now, we were checked in for 1 night in the smaller Deluxe room. It was still spacious, and the gorgeous view of the city is still there. The view from the Skydeck is still incomparable. Infinity pool was better managed and not as crowded as i had visited last time. The staff were friendly and helpful.But, now I was able to look closely, i can see the hotel itself is not as properly maintained as it should be.First thing is, the pillows stink of sweat.I thought it was just one, but it was all the pillows except that one pillow they keep in the closet for reserve. We called room service to replace the pillows and pointed out the reason why we wanted to change it. They were apologetic and sent somebody right up with new pillows, but it still smelled SWEATY. Definitely not a good night sleep there. We didn't want to make a fuss so we just requested for some spare blankets to wrap over the pillows to mask the smell.All the time I was thinking, \this is a 5 star hotel and their pillows smell like it came from a budget motel?\"" The bathroom was very spacious, but then I began to think if that was by design? Or they just cannot afford to put in a bath tub, a bidet, or a power outlet for a hair dryer inside the bathroom? The shower temperature control just boggled me. I followed whichever way direction i was to turn the knob to adjust the hot/cool water but it still was very hot or very cold! And there was no lock to the very modern bathroom sliding door.All in all, it was very disappointing stay. I guess it all snowballed from the fact that they had sweaty pillows :(""",115
MBS,3,“Not Bad”,"Its a location in itself, so if you are coming specially for the Marina Bay Sands experience, then choosing this hotel is a no brainer. However there are other hotels that are more centrally located. So if your consideration is to be closer to business and other tourist attractions, there are other good options to explore.Rooms were clean, service satisfactory, food was okay. Check in and Check out was okay, nothing exceptionally good or bad. The Skybar is definitely amazing and highly recommended. Plus they play some really good music.All in all, I travel quite a bit and this was a stay like in any hotel one would normally expect. Nothing exceptionally good or bad.",170
MBS,2,“Under whelmed.”,"What a disappointment. From check in to check out. Stayed 4 nights at this property in a club level room at approx AUD$500 per night. After a lengthy delay in check in we were left to find our own way back out into the mall like lobby and any request for directions were met with pointing of the hand and a sullen expression; not a word of greeting offered anywhere.The rooms are large. The bathrooms are large. The views are large. They're not especially well furnished, charming or interesting. No token of hospitality such as a welcome letter, piece of fruit, nothing. Club level should be special. Otherwise, why offer it?Breakfast in the club lounge was crowded, evening drinks in the club lounge was crowded, we didn't try for relaxing in the club lounge as, it's crowded. There are 2500 odd rooms in this property and a high percentage of the rooms would be double occupancy. The pool is crowded.This property is a factory, stay here if you love crowds.",62
MBS,3,“Nothing great except the over crowded swimming pool”,"I stayed here couple of times due to its logistic location next to the convention center. I will say that the hotel is just a normal 5 star hotel with nice facade only. Nothing impressed me beside the infinity swimming pool located at 57 floor, and yet the swimming pool is way to crowded for me to enjoy a decent relax moment.",387
MBS,1,“Extremely poor value for money”,"My 3 nights have been a big disappointment – if you compare it with similar hotels in Singapore it is a completely overpriced hotel with only its amazing view living up to expectations.Having seen the impressive Marina Bay Sands (MBS) building and the famous pool on previous trips, I was keen to check out the hotel with my girlfriend for the 2012 New Year celebration. But it has been a very disillusioned stay. At the room rates they charge at MBS you can stay at much better hotels such as the Fullerton Bay, Fullerton or Ritz Carlton. I have no idea who would actually come back to the MBS if you are not a Chinese or Indonesian gambler that apparently enjoy soulless mass market tourist locations. I was especially disappointed by:- The mass market feel of the whole hotel. It’s crowded everywhere – at the check-in, in the lobby, at the pool- The late check-in. Having to wait till 3.05pm to get access to my room is not standard for high-end hotels. Also 11am check-out is rather early- Shockingly quality of the room. Room quality is more like 3-4* when comparing it to similarly priced hotels in SIN. The design, the materials, the furniture, the bathroom – all feels very cheap- Poor in-room entertainment. Only the first 24h of WiFi are free – not market standard. No DVD player so you can’t get free DVDs from the concierge. Limited TV channels (26 in total, skewed towards local languages). Ridiculous movie on demand prices: SGD 17 for 2 year old movies that are labelled as “new releases”- Disappointing SkyPool. The SkyPool is constantly overcrowded so you struggle getting 2 deck chairs next to each other. The pool looks great on pictures (with no actual guests in it). But in reality it’s overrun by hords of tourists all dayIn summary, if you are keen to stay in a cool looking hotel next to a pretty amazing casino, I suggest to fly to Las Vegas or Macao. If you look for a top-end hotel that makes you feel exclusive and special, I suggest you look elsewhere in Singapore. If you can’t live without the view from MBS, enjoy it for free from the KuDaTa club on top of MBS (free entry till 9pm). But do stay somewhere else in Singapore.",313
MBS,3,“Enjoyable and breath taking views”,"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel had been a place we were dying to stay in ever since we heard of it. The architecture was never short of breathtaking and the hype had build us up for an incredible experience. The latter, we were to find out was rather disappointing.We were entitled to a complementary MBS shuttle from the airport to the hotel, only to be greeted by an overly bossy and rude bus driver. On arrival to the hotel, we felt like a bunch of cattle herded to be checked in. With no porters, nor signs to direct us, we were being lead in to the general foyer, and had to direct our way to the check-in counter. To make the initial experience worse, we were swarmed with a sea of other tourists coming for every other direction. To be honest, we were really expecting a more personal and welcoming greeting from a highly acclaimed 5 star hotel. We stayed in tower 2 of the building. The views are spectacular, and the poolside was fantastic. Again, apart from being absolutely packed out with tourist and locals, the Infinity pool was the indeed the crown of this hotel offering breathtaking views of Singapore City and an awesome place to lounge and relax.The Hotel was accessible to the MRT, Marina Bay sends shopping centre and host multiple light and fountain shows which left us dumbfounded in it's complexity. My partner and myself stayed there for 3 days and was satisfied with the overall service we received. On checking out, we were also offered keys to a 'Refreshment room' which provided a comfortable lounge to rest, a powder room, as well as complementary tea and coffee before leaving the hotel to catch a flight. What a great idea! This seemed to be the only hotel to offer this out of the many that we have visited.",121
MBS,3,“Nice view but average stay”,"I think the hotel is famous due to the architecture and also the nice view from each hotel rooms. Overall I had a pleasant stay and the room is clean and spacious for us. Of course I can't deny that the Sky Park is superb and you should visit it at least once in your life time, especially during night time. My kids enjoyed playing in the swimming pool as well. Another plus is the check-in time was not as long as I expected though it was a Christmas eve on that day.

The infinity pool is just as cool as the pictures look. - the view is incredible. Went swimming at daybreak and had the pool to ourselves - amazing to watch the sun rise at the edge of the pool. We went again and spent the day sunbathing. Great pool side food service. But while the hotel room was as clean and spacious as should be expected at those prices and had a wonderful view of the city, the service/attitude of staff was uncaring and sometimes disrespectful. The check in process was painful. The lines long and slow moving and the process, by the amount of typing our reception person did was labourous- you guys need to invest in some new software. I had the door shut in my face by doormen and bellboys more than I can count. If you go, rent for one day and spend the rest at the high-end Fullerton, or book a spot as a non-resident and use the pool.",367
MBS,3,"“awesome views from the pool, but altogether not worth the money”","I spent two days over christmas in this hotel. The view from the pool is of course spectacular, but it is also very crowded. If you want to do some serious swimming attempts, it probably is not sufficient for you. The restrooms in the poolarea look like the constructionteam wasn't able to finish their work...Besides that I didn't feel it is worth spending the money (around 300 EUR per night):The Hotel is hugh and you feel more like being at an airport than in a luxury hotel. The room was quite spacious. Although on the eleventh floor it was quite noisy because of the highway that runs along the back side of the hotel. So try to get a room as high as possible. The furnishing was kind of run down and in the style of the seventies - to me it seemed that they were actually from this period, because of all the damages. Besides that the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was nice, but it smelled a little bit of drain water.The staff is friendly, but quite often they seemed to be overwhelmed with the amount of customers they have to handle.The Hotel has it's own MRT Station: Bayfront, which is quite convienent, but still you have to walk quite around to reach it. The Mall in front of the Marina bay Sands is hugh, with awesome Restaurants and Bars as well as with a decent food court. High class shops and labels can be found here.The Casion is not comparable with the ones in Vegas: Chinese are the majority of the customers and they do take gambling serious...so the minimum bets are quite high, there aren't any player vs. player poker tables and on the ground floor smoking is allowed.I would say if it is your first time ein Singapore, you can stay there for one or two nights and enjoy the unique view over marina bay and the singaporian skyline (and over the gradens by the Bay), but for this amount of money you will find nicer places in Singapore in terms of furnishing, service and general style...From a hotel of this category (and price) I expect more than just an awesome poolview",147
MBS,2,“The Titanic for High End Travellers”,"Stayed in a suite for the week. US 6500.00 per night and expected intimate, exclusive and luxurious. The suite was large, luxurious and with great views and the hotel is well located but our most disappointing stay in Singapore. This was like staying in the middle of a disney theme park and the \club\"" privileges were apparently open to several thousands of people each day. Some staff were very good but many were very poor. Whilst we had the services of a 24 hour butler, we couldn't even get a simple breakfast of scrambled egg and hash brown - they were not able to accomodate the request! Many items in the room were broken and needed attention but even on our last day, things had not been fixed.

Excellent infinity pool with breath taking view (although the pool side is a bit crowded). The view is also excellent from the room.

Now the Bad ExperienceSpent 3 nights there before Christmas. Booked a deluxe room along with via travel agency a few months ago. We also requested an extra bed for my 5-year old at the time of the booking a few months ago.Arrived at about 8:30 pm. The Check-In was swift. At the Check-In counter, I inquired about the extra bed we had reserved, the reply at the Front Desk was “It will be sent to your room in 15 to 20 minutes”. We waited for 2 hours. Still no bed delivery. So I called the Express Priority Phone Line. The first operator’s reply was “Sorry, all the beds were fully book”. Eventually the extra bed was delivered at close to 11:30 pm - 3 hours after arrival.Woke up the following morning. Back slightsly hurts due to the softness of the mattress. So I wrote a note to the Hotel Manager/ Executive Housekeeper to see what could be done, plus reported the fact that one of the in-room phone units did not work. Returning to the hotel at early evening. Nothing was done to my room. Went down stairs and spoke with Front Desk Manager to work out the mattress problem. Came back after dinner - as soon as my 5-year old jumps on the mattress of her bed and then bounces her body on the king size bed… BANG!!! She landed on hard wood board. Painful!!! I hurt my knee as well. Please see photo Apparently they have put a hard wood board right underneath the bed sheets! Called Express Priority Phone to have the Board removed. Waited 40 minutes no one came. So I along with my 5 year old went down to front desk to look for the Manager to complain. I was pretty upset. I was quickly surrounded by and confronted by 3 burly security guards. The burliest of the guards glared at me angrily and spoke to me rudely “What is your problem?” [Has anyone taught them to say “May I help you?” I told them to go way.Finally I had a Front Desk Manager followed me back to my room. The wise talking guy says having the guest sleep on a hard wood board is their way of handling customer’s complaint of soft mattress. He says all the major hotels worldwide do the same. Yeah right!About one hour after this episode, someone finally came to remove the hard wood board and put the sheets back on. This was about 11:15 pm.The at 11:45 pm, I got another call from Housekeeper asking whether I need someone to push 2 single beds together. Of course not! This room only has One king size bed and a small extra bed. I don't need to push two sigle beds together. I need to sleep.This has been one hell of an awful experience.Next day also got visits by two senior housekeepers who apologized and left behind a few sample bottles of shampoo and conditioners, and a teddy bear as their way of apologizing. My daughter likes the bear...but sorry I use Head and Shoulders.My suggestion : Stay Somewhere Else!",483
MBS,2,“Shocking service for a 5* hotel”,"The only reason I've given this hotel 2 stars instead of 1 is because the roof top pool is amazing. If I had to sum up this hotel in a few words, it would be - the service is terrible. We arrived to check in at 4pm after 14 hours travelling from Paris. We were told that our room was not yet ready (check in was 3pm). After travelling for that long, all we wanted to do was have a shower and change into clean clothes. We were told that it would probably be another hour before our room was ready. We were given $100 credit to use within the hotel for the inconvenience and told that we could wait in a lounge room that had a shower. No one could tell us where the 'lounge room' was and we couldn't find it... As we couldn't find the lounge room, we had to line up again at the very busy reception. They then gave us a key to a waiting room where other guests were also waiting to check into their rooms. We arrived at this room and it was so full with other people that we had to sit outside on the balcony in 40 degree heat with people smoking. There was no chance of getting a shower in that room. Back to reception we went again. This time they gave us a key to another room that wasn't actually in use by anyone else. By this time 1.5 hours had passed by, and still no news on our room to check in. We decided to have a shower in this room while we were waiting. It was then that I discovered why no one was actually staying in this room. The shower only had one temperature setting - very hot! I think the tap was broken, as it was impossible to get any cold water. At this point I gave up on having a shower. We then called reception a few more times to find out when we could check into our room (they never called us back when they said they would). We finally checked into our room 2.5 hours after we arrived at the hotel (3.5 hours after check in time!). After we had finally checked in, we freshened up and went out for dinner. To top off our experience nicely, when we arrived back to our room, we couldn't get into our room - the key had been deactivated! Back we went to reception again...I cannot believe how much trouble we had just checking into our room. It was totally unacceptable, especially for a 5 star hotel. I would never stay here again. The $100 credit they gave us in no way compensated for the terrible service they gave us. You'd be better off staying somewhere else and just 'visiting' here to see the pool, shops, casino etc.",959
MBS,3,“Cheap luxury - a train station with superb infinity pool”,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands over a weekend trip from KL in a Premier City View Room on the 28th floor. If you are looking for a luxury stay, this is not a luxury hotel despite the ridiculous prices. Somebody mentioned in a review here that a 20 dollar elevator right to the top is worth it to see the pool and \how the rich live\"". It's quite a funny statement because this is not a place where \""the rich\"" stay - the rich stay at Mandarin Oriental, Fullerton and Ritz Carlton, while Marina Bay Sands is a complete train station in terms of service and experience - crowds of tourists, primarily from Asia. The exorbitant prices with poor service create an atmosphere of pretentious luxury but a far cry from it. A buffet dinner in one of the restaurants at the lobby costs 85 USD per person, breakfast at 40 USD, the exact same 1.5 hr spa treatment that we just had in Bali for 35 USD costs ... hold your breath... 450 USD. The room costs 450 USD a night or so, and it's good - good size, large spacious bathroom with a comfi bathtub, great view over the city skyline and marina, but it's all tainted by the crowdedness of the hotel. The pool on the 57th floor is incredible, out of the question, but again crowded during the sunshine, deserted during storms due to lightning danger (you are actually not allowed to stay even if you wanted to). We wanted to stay on the roof to watch the storm while enjoying coffee - guess what, the only suitable place, a quite large Club Lounge is only accessible if you stay in Club rooms. The Lounge was totally empty yet we were not allowed in despite already paying premium prices for the room - we figured it's some Asian status thing.The room is in a perfect condition, although ours was smoked in on a non smoking floor. The maids brought in some ionizer, that helped.There is a choice of the rooms on the other side facing the Straights and the Gardens by the Bay, another tourist attraction with out of this world artificial Giant Trees and Conservatories of the Cold Mountain and Flower Dome. Those come with an open balcony, im not sure why the city view is priced more, maybe for the light show at night over the marina?Food choices - we didn't try the hotel restaurants, and were unfortunate to have two crappy meals at the Shoppes - do not go there! The same aftertaste of \""cheap luxury\"" permeates the Shoppes: expensive and empty designer stores where nobody buys anything intermingled with bad overpriced restaurants selling pretentious luxury food. At a grill place in the Shoppes because we don't take alcohol and hence didn't order wine we were immediately placed in a \""cheap guest\"" category and hence were spared the flowery introduction of menu items interspersed with French nonsense of \""Crème Chantilly\"" (that stands for plain old whipped cream). The Shoppes has some cheap entertainment a theater showing musicals of some sort, if you are after some \""culture\"" check out the Esplanade instead, one of the largest performing arts centers in the world, with a proper concert hall.The infinity pool on the 57th floor is breathtaking (good they don't charge you 400 bucks to spend a day there). It's a worth a try. If you don't stay in the hotel you can come up for 20 bucks but only to see, not to swim, i don't think. The pool was crowded during the \""good\"" hours, somebody in a review here recommended to come early in the morning before the crowds gather - well i recommend coming after 10 pm (the pool closes at 11pm) - the water and the air is much warmer, there is no wind, the night lights of Singapore are dazzling, and there is only a few swimmers. We also tried 8 am and it was terrible - cold water as the pool is not heated, cold air, cold wind, people sitting wrapped in beach towels waiting out for the sun, urgh, bring a fleece jacket! Parking: we heard from Malaysian friends that parking is very expensive in Singapore so a lot Malaysians who drive down, leave their cars in Johor Bahru and take a quick train/bus ride from there. Well, Marina Bay Sands parking for hotel guests is only 12 dollars a day, so don't worry about that. A different thing is that you don't need a car in Singapore as it is well connected by MRT lines that will take you to any tourist spot you'd want to see.Food: the in room breakfast we had at the hotel was good quality food, very nicely presented, good experience, so I'm guessing the food in the hotel restaurants is pretty good if you don't mind the prices. The food in the Shoppes is just bad, don't risk your wallet. There is an ok small food court in the Gardens by the Bay where you can have breakfast, lunch desert, etc, it's 2-3 times cheaper than in the hotel. The architects definitely overshot with the size - they should have made 2 towers an office and only 1 a hotel. With all the crowds, the entire complex feels like a Treasure Island full of donkeys (sorry!). It's nice to have tried and to say \""I've stayed there and swam in that super pool\"", but that's about it. Perhaps it's the Christmas time to be blamed for the crowds but im not sure it gets any better off peak. If you dont care for infinity swimming on the 57th floor, spend your money on Mandarin Oriental and just come visit the roof.""",243
MBS,1,“Just come from Capella Santosa- this place is a joke!”,"We called today at 09.30 to ask if any of our 3 booked rooms could be available around 13.00, they said \maybe one\"". This was avialable but we had 2 CLUB rooms (interconnecting) BOOKED and nothing available,\""maybe by 15.00!\"" we eventually got access to all rooms at 22.45 after getting one clubroom at 17.45! As we stood in the VIP area we were surrenided by peole who had not gotwaht they had booked! SO, after all this trauma we went out for dinner- somewhere else thank goodness, they understood service and were not so arrogant!- when came back we fancied a drink, went to the the Club foor at 10.55 it was shutting! we were told to go to Tower 3 and floor 57, we arrived there where in order to get a drink we were charged S$240 for 5 people you got \""free\"" CHEAPEST prosecco you can imagine - passed off as Cahmpange!- ten for any decent drink another S$250 for 5!The Hotel gave us noinformation on check in and when we went up this \""clip joint\"" on floor 57 it was full of staff with attitude and so rude! everywhere there are seats with no one in them with \""reserved\"" on the table! The whole day has been a teribeklexperience, if we could go back the Capella I would. This is the most over rated,pretensious, jumped up over pariced poorly staffed place I have ever had the misfortune to stay in!""",211
MBS,3,“The view is entertaining for a short stay”,"First of all the obvious: The views are fantastic. Who needs the Singapore Flyer when you have the sort of views available at this hotel?The good (in addition to the view):1) Spacious modern rooms2) An enormous shopping mall and associated entertainment and food options attached3) A large casino if you’re feeling weighed down by your wallet and are into such things4) Friendly and accommodating staff, particularly at the Club Lounge5) A most interesting pool6) Complimentary bus service to and from the airportThe bad:1) Club Lounge access is over sold in the sense that you can expect to wait half an hour if you’re looking to attend for afternoon tea or cocktails in the evening2) A bit of a “gimmicky” feel to the whole place – the hotel feels a bit like a theme hotel in Vegas. This is probably not accidental. We stayed two nights and, by the end of that time, felt like we had our fill of the hotel. The size of the property combined with the business of the pool and lounge area overcame the view and initial novelty value.In summary: If you give the hotel a try for a couple of days it’s an entertaining novelty but it wouldn’t be my first choice next time in Singapore.",140
MBS,3,“disappointing”,"We have a company retreat and stayed in the Marina Bay Sands.Quite an experience. Our club room at 43 Floor had a spectacular view.The bath was large, but lighting in the bath room lacking in light.From 55 floor to 57 floor is a hassle. The first afternoon from the 55 floor security check our hotel room card and let us switch elevator to 57 floor and we when to the club lounge for tea and was good.In the evening we wanted to go for the cocktail security insist us show our swimming slip which we didn bring along because we are not swimming, why is the hotel room card is not good enough ? BTW The pool is always over crowding. Overall experience is not what I have expected at MBS especially when you have book the CLUB ROOM !",144
MBS,2,“Only the view is impressive”,"Early morning check in 06:30 was hopeless - only two overworked, tired and disinterested staff available who could not let us into our room until 13:00. Instead offered a waiting lounge which would have accommodated maximum eight people in comfort and they were already there. Although the hotel is only a bit over a year old, foyer was blocked up by renovation work being done on the coffee bar. Standard room was nothing special. There are better value rooms than these in Singapore. To the pool. Yes the view is spectacular, less so the surrounds. No proper change facilities and toilets were also being renovated. Only saving grace was the smiling faces and helpful attitude of the waitresses at breakfast. So, stay one night, have a swim, enjoy the view and then move to another hotel for the rest of your stay in Singapore.",137
MBS,3,“Amazing to look at but service needs work”,"We stayed here on our way back from our month long trip it was our anniversary so we thought this hotel would be perfect. The roof top park was amazing and our room was great, concierge were rude and extremely unhelpful, when we asked were we should go for our anniversary they gave us a map and sent us away to read it. When my husband organised a special gift for me they got it wrong and when my husband rang them to fix it they said come back tomorrow it took 2 managers to fix our experience, my suggestion take your staff to michaels or festive on sentosa island let them shadow them so they learn how to delight your customers cause if I'd wanted 3 star service I would have paid for a cheaper hotel",165
MBS,2,“Endless queuing”,"This hotel is an architectural jewel and the Sky Pool is a unique experience, yes. But what you will find inside has nothing to do with a high standard 5 star hotel. We arrived 3.15 pm, and had to wait 40 min to make the check-in!! And then guess what, the room (Club category, about 500$ per night) is not ready. But if you get though with the lady (which is all but fast in service), you finally get a room as you booked it. Some people next to us were about 30 min at the counter, while the queue kept growing.As there was no one to assist us with our luggage, the check-in lady went strolling through the huge lobby until she found a lower manager to help us ;-) Queuing continues at the Club on the 57th floor, and even for the check-out.So rather consider sneak in the Sky Pool (many people manage this) and spend your money on a truly luxury hotel.",425
MBS,3,“Good package but leaves more to be desired”,"We had the club room for 1 night. VIP LoungeWhen we were queuing up to check-in, a staff told us that as we booked the booked the club room, we should check-in at the VIP lounge. The VIP lounge is just a smaller check-in area reserved for VIPs but it does not make its guest feel the same. The staff were not able to manage the queue well and the queue got rather long and even extended out of the VIP lounge.As we had checked in rather early, the staff told us that our room is not ready, hence we requested that a call to be made to us when the room is ready. However, until the check-in time of 3pm, we had not received any call from the staff regarding our room.RoomThe room was huge with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay. The bed was comfy, however the pillows were rather flat. The standalone bathtub was huge. One major peeve was that the toilet reeks of cigarette smoke. Though we have requested for a non-smoking room, it seems that someone have smoked an entire packet of cigarettes in there. The cigarette smell did not dissipate during our stay.Swimming poolGreat view! Can be crowded. Need to pick the right time to visit. Towels strewn around. Toilets are not clean.FoodThe club room comes with complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and pre-dinner cocktails. It was set in the dining area at the Sky Park which gives a great view of Singapore. While waiting for our table, the staff were very friendly and offered us drinks. The food selection are ok.AttitudeBesides the dining staff, the rest of the staff were not very friendly. The housekeeping staff at our level had a face as black as a charcoal. Perhaps she had a bad day.WIFIThe free WIFI was inconsistent during our stay with the connection dropped off several times. We gave up and relied on our own 3G network.OverallThe MBS is huge. Signs were not obvious. We had to make trips from tower 1 to tower 3 repeatedly as we couldn't find the express checkout machine. The crowd at MBS is quite bad and does not seem like a hotel but more like a crowded shopping mall. Staff need to be more trained to manage the crowd. The hotel is also not very child-friendly. For the amount we paid, we would expect some provisions made for them. At another hotel, we were able borrow DVDs to entertain the kids, had children bathrobes and slippers and even coloring packs.",292
MBS,2,“Regrettable”,"That's what you get when you stay at a Casino resort hotel. I paid over $500 Singapore, for a Club room. It felt that everyone that stayed the MBS, was on the Club floor. Imagine, taking over 20 minutes to check in, then having a 45 minute wait as they put the finishing touches on the room! The check in wait, I had to stand in line, no seats for the elderly, no offer of water or refreshments while waiting.I decided to wait for my room key at the Club on 57th floor. The Club was beautiful and the drinks were complimentary from 5pm to 7pm, which was standard. I left the Club at 6pm and was shocked at the line of \Club\"" room pass waiting to get in, I have never seen this in any hotel or resort.To say the hotel is big, is an understatement. When I checked out, I asked the concierge to send up a porter. After 20 minutes, I received a call informing me that the porter will be on his way shortly. I told them that I will bring my own bags down, you never know by \""on the way\"", they could mean another 20 minutes.Our room was on the 20th floor, facing the Garden by the Bay. All night I was disturbed by the sound of cars, trucks and motorbikes. So much so that I got out of bed and checked to make sure all the windows were closed, they were! Not a comfortable night's rest.MBS did have 1 saving grace. I stayed there because I wanted to eat at Wolfgang Puk's \""Cut\"" restaurant and to see a show. If these were not located within a covered walking distance, I would have stayed elsewhere.Never again!""",195
MBS,3,“Far below expectations”,"We stayed for three nights in a premium room (reservation said seaview, had a room facing the city), whatever that means in Sand terminology. The building is impressive and we had been there a few times before we decided to stay here. After 3 days the lobby area is becoming increasingly annoying, loud and more like a train station than a 5 star hotel. The room is nothing special and if you want to command 550 SGD ++ per night one could expect that the room is being made up before 5pm? Internet connectivity can at best be described as patchy, signal strength at the minimum, speed like in the old days with a telephone line dial up.The best place for sure is the pool on the Skydeck, but with no shade available it is not a place that you can stay for too long before being turned into charcoal. Breakfast is OK, good selection at the buffet, but again masses of people that make it hard to enjoy. We made the experience, next time back to more private places such as the Fullerton and then look at MBS from the outside, very impressive indeed.",203
MBS,1,"“\Empty promises\"".”""","PRO:~Skypark access, never fails to take my breath away.~Gym with panoramic views.~Luxurious rooms, with adequate ammenities.CON:~Checking in is still a pain. What kind of hotel forces you to check out the next day at 12pm...only to give me the keys of the room at 3pm, so i am paying MBS my hard earned money to enjoy the hotel room for only 21 hours?!?~The mini bar is a profit making machine for them.~Service is delivered at a very superficial level, Front office staff give you mediocre service. All the branding that this hotel is about luxury and \living the high life\"" is a lie.~My conclusion is MBS is not ready to manage Singapore's biggest hotel. The attention to detail is not there, there is a lack of apathy among its staff, and worst of all, because of the sheer magnitude of this property, many hotel guests like me will be marginalised, and we have to pay for this mistake, by forking out S$400 for a 1 night stay, for a lesson to teach me that in the hotel business, CHOOSE REPUTABLE BRAND NAMES in the market, let hotels like MBS continue to be a tourist trap, while it continues ripping off innocent hotel guests.""",179
MBS,3,“Nice pool - pity about the hotel”,After having just spent 5 days at a five star hotel in Langkawi we travelled on to Singapore to do some shopping and decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands for its location but mainly to access its rooftop infinity pool. Let me start off by saying that the infinity pool met our expectations and we thoroughly enjoyed this part of our stay. Unfortunately otherwise we felt we did not get value for money. Despite our room being over $100 dearer per night than the 5 star hotel we stayed at in Langkawi we were placed on the second floor facing the road. Room was neat but otherwise service was non existent. On the final morning of our stay there was maintenance being performed on the communal area of our floor for which we had been given no notice about and had commenced early in the morning interrupting our sleep. If you want to visit for the infinity pool then go for it but otherwise choose somewhere else to stay that will offer better value for money and service!!,828
MBS,1,“No Standards or personal service”,"i have decided to stay here because of the name and peoples word of mouth, i have stayed from 2nd dec until the 7th in room 1823 in a club room and i had payed around 4000 dollards during my stay, expecting my moneys worth. as soon as i checked in i was happy to know that i had an exclusive vip lounge check in, when i went inside i was shocked that i had to stand in line,,, (in the VIP) check in after 10 mins i was attended and was given the room, the room is big and nice. but next day around noon i had my DND on in my room and i was changing my clothes then i hear someone say housekeeping (once) and open the door directly , i had to run towards the door and slam it, when i got dressed i opened again and showed the cleaning lady that i have put on the DND , it was on she just said sory and left, if the hotel checks the CCTV camera they can check that its true, but im sure that from what i experienced they do not put any effort in solving the guess needs especially problems, next day in the night upon entering my room i saw an insect crawl under my bed im not sure it might have been a cockrouch, i then called the operator and they sent houskeeping to kill it then i just left to the casino when i then never heard any feedback or apologies or anyone trying to resolve or satisfy me. next day upon making the payment in reception they were soo slow it took me 20 min while doing the payment that i was playing angrybirds on my phone in front of the receptionist and i got a new high score..the elevators can get confusing and you must put in your key card in order to be able to press the button, that can be uncomfortable when there is always lots of people. when i went to the club floor and it looked like a staff criteria but it was on the sky park i had to wait about 3 min in line then was escorted by the hostess, she then pointed at a table and said, that table is yours when those people leave, i was shocked and stood in my place, then she showed me to another table that was already set up, when i went to see what food they have, they had sandwiches. hahaha sandwiches i even took a picture of it and i will post it in this website, this is supposed to be an exclusive lounge, it was like a fishmarket with people in shorts and flip flops. another thing to show that this hotel has no standards, when going back to my room in the corridor the housekeeping trolley was left near the entrance of my door it was unattended and no staff were around. i then called reception to see if they can give me a let checkout next day since i have a club room, they said no, they said that i have to pay half the room rate, i then called them next day and said that ok ill pay for it then they said no even if you pay we cannot offer you because the hotel is full they gave me 10 min to leave the room after i finished my call with them at 12:45 pm. one thing the bar service was very good FUZE staff were excellent especially amira and earny, very polite and good service. another thing my club room floor included breakfast in the 57th floor and i wanted to know if i could have it in the all day dining, then i was in tower 3 and asked the chinese restaurant if my breakfast was included, she said no then i went to tower 1 to the big all day dining restaurant and asked them if i can have breakfast there the hostess told me that i have to go and check at the reception, so i went to the vip reception waited for 5 min in line and asked and they said ok, so then i went back and told them yes, as soon as they sat me down they gave me the bill, ofcourse they did not charge me i just had to sign but it felt impolite to give me the bill if i did not order it, the restaurant should have another procedure for this, anyway next time i will stay in another 5 star hotel for half the price that i spent in MBS and im sure it will be Insect free and i will be treated like a guest. its a big statement to say that such a magnificent building is terrible, but its a shame on how its managed, and the value for money is extremely terrible.",128

MBS,2,“All wow but no substance!”,"My husband and I stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon and although it is an impressive building we were disappointed with this hotel on many levels.Check-in was slow as there were only 2 members of staff working, however, when we did finally get served we were given a bedroom that was ready (as check-in isn't until 3pm). When we got to our Deluxe Room we expected something a bit more special for a 5 star hotel and what we got wasn't deluxe at all. It was a very average room with standard facilities. The room overlooked the gardens by the bay and one of the main roads and was very noisy. We realised the reason for this is that the door that opened up onto a large but unfurnished and slighly pointless balcony didnt close properly and there was a gap between the door and the frame. We called facilities who sent a guy up to sort it out which involved him kicking the door to close the gap.The tea and coffee making facilities were very basic indeed.Seeing as it was our honeymoon all they did for us was send a lady to make two swans out of towels and scatter some rose petals on the bed. Room service food was good and hot but over priced for what we had.The SkyPark is great and the views from the top impressive but the attitude of staff up there wasn't good - one guy as really rude.Everything is really expensive here so expect to pay to do anything. There is no communal area for guests of the hotel to sit and read etc - you have to go into a bar or restaurant.On checking out (again which took a while like check-in) I complained about the noisy room to which the response from the member of staff was \maybe next time get a premier room\"" to which I said I won't be coming back!It's a shame. There is no doubt that architecturally this is an amazing building. It's just that the hotel within has no other USP. The experience felt very flat and artificial.""",112

What a shame. For such a big hotel, i would expect the check in procedure to be centralized. The view from the window is superb. We are facing gardens by the bay. Complimentary coffee is one sachet of robert timms coffee and the pillow really smells like socks. Overall, i am disappointed. Paid 400sgd for smelly pillows. Royal scotts and mandarin orchard are all better.",448
MBS,1,“crap service.”,"service was terrible.staff at the sweet spot were rude. i had placed an order for a cake with the concierge and was told even via email confirmation that all i needed to do was to turn up and pay at the sweet spot. on arrival at the cake shop after waiting while the caucasian customers behind me were served, i was \attended to\"" by a very rude ?turkish lady who informed me that a) the email which i showed her was wrong b) i had not made a booking with the sweet spot and c) she did not know what i was talking about. she asked me multiple times whether i had sent an email and when i had even after i had shown her the email on my iphone.subsequently i had tried to arrange for flowers to be delivered to the concierge counter via phone. however the lady manning the phone did not understand what i was trying to tell her.even worse, my companion traveller (who i had ordered the flowers for as a surprise) was at the concierge counter, sorting out arrangements for valet services, and overheard the counter staff shouting out the order for flowers to my room (although i had instructed the concierge that it would be a surprise).thanks a lot for spoiling the surprise, MBS!the next day, i had driven out and come back through a jam. the valet services were being manned by teenagers who were unsure where the valet lane was. i was directed first left, then right, then when i questioned why i was being given conflicting instructions, had to wait and hold up traffic while the inexperienced staff member referred to a more \""senior\"" valet ( a middle aged indian gentleman) who very rudely told me that i had to drive my care over to the other lane, past 2 lanes of moving traffic. there was no help given while i had to cut through 3 lanes of packed traffic.in short, crap service quality, inattentive service staff, uninterested in helping people.the room view sucks, and the pool is crowded, but that MBS cannot help. what it can do, is fire its crap service trainers and hire more intelligent people. for a supposed world-class hotel to hire 17 year old untrained valets, service staff that are rude to customers and serve caucasians before locals, and provide crap concierge and valet service.. please! i can give my money to places like naumi, quincy, fullerton bay hotel, pan pacific, all of which give fantastic, attentive service for cheaper or equivalent price with similar facilities.i work with people 24/7 in my job, and i would never treat my clients the way they do.pathetic!""",678
MBS,3,“A bit of Vegas in Singapore”,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands with my mother during F1 grand prix week.The building and skypark itself is very impressive, but the hotel was less so for me. Room: Our first room, which was a deluxe room didn’t have a bathtub, so I was forced to upgrade to the next room type available. (Premier room). It is a bit ridiculous to have to fork out approx. $ 100++ more for a room with a bathtub and an extra 8sqm of space, when you’re already paying an extortionate amount. The first room was quite small so the extra 8 sqm was welcome. Furnishings are modern and comfortable provided you choose the right room type. Our hotel room windows (floor to ceiling) offered sweeping views of the city skyline and portions of the grand prix circuit.Note: Book a room with a city view. The habour view is nothing to write home about and isn’t pretty. However, harbor view rooms do have balconies, if you need one.They also have views of the much hyped Gardens by the Bay However, they are a high -tech work in progress so don’t expect to be blown away by prettiness either. The electronic room keys never worked. And since you can only operate the elevator by inserting your room key, it was a nightmare flight into ear-popping hell. I am all for technology, but only if it actually works.And trust me, it is quite difficult to find someone to come up 22 floors and open your room door at midnight. Hotel Complex: The hotel has that brash Vegas resort feel. Big, busy and noisy. About as relaxing as camping out in the middle of Orchard Street. In fairness we did stay at the hotel during the F1 week so the hotel may have been busier than normal. However, it’s a massive hotel so it should do “busy” with less discomfort. Food: Edible but nothing to rave about. Breakfast was chaotic and “thrown” at you. Again, it may have been because of the F1, but is there really an excuse for mediocrity when you’re operating a massive 5* hotel? Had lunch at Sky on 57. Very fresh, bordering on bland, chicken rice. Lovely views. Desert was delectable and beautiful.Spa (Banyan Tree) looked amazing but sadly I didn’t have a chance to try any treatments. The infinity pool is impressive. However, it was overcrowded on the first evening we went up to the skypark. This was just before the pool closed at about 10 p.m. You couldn’t have paid me enough money to dip even my big toe into the pool.On our last evening, the pool was much less busy. We watched the F1 grand prix from inside the pool. Not a bad spot to watch portions of the F1 from with decent binoculars.The pool is not open to the public.The drinks at the skypark are expensive. The music that pumps from the club in the skypark is relentless. If muffled background noise offends you then avoid the skypark after dinner, unless you’re going into the club. The Shoppes (sic) were amazing. Check out the Louis Vuitton flagship store. The pizza at the famed Pizzeria Mozza was great and the get up was fresh and funky.Access from the hotel using the underground/subway is relatively easy, though this is not a necessity in Singapore as taxi fare is usually quite reasonable, and taxis are probably faster. Just don’t get into the so-called “premier” or “premium” or “luxury” taxi’s as it will cost you $10 extra to ride in a pimped out old Chrysler or Merc. Perhaps staying at Raffles before the M.B.S dimmed the sparkle of this flashy noveau diamond in Singapore’s crown. At Raffles you’re treated like you’re somebody (even if you’re not), but at the MBS you’re just a number baby, and you’d better be prepared to wait in line…. However, if you’re young (or young at heart) and you’re searching for that Vegas vibrancy and energy then, putting all my own foibles aside in the interest of objectivity, the M.B.S. would be a good choice.",91
MBS,3,“Iconic Hotel”,"This fantastically designed hotel with the wonderful back drop of Singapore takes your breath away. The bar on top is a must, although the staff were a little indifferent. The bar in the atrium had live music, good bar food and great staff. The breakfast in the restaurant Rise in the lobby was good, albeit busy. Rooms are well appointed and clean.Bad Points - Check in and Check Out were painfully slow, and my room was not ready, so was offered another room, which turned out to be a smoking room.",215
MBS,2,“Nice Hotel with Poor service”,"To be honest, the hotel decoration was very impressive. I especially love the big bathroom, it was such a nice romantic retreat! The pool was excellent but a bit crowded.My experience there was unexpectedly terrible. My friend is a VIP member there and my first impression was very good to have a VIP check-in. A bit surprise for me that was long que in the VIP Lounge and my room was not yet finished until 2PM!! Then I decide the go to Sentosa first and finally came back at 7PM and was totally disappointed that my room was still not yet ready. I had to wait til 8.30PM to get the room with dirty curtain and big spot like red wine. Upon check out, again we have to que for payment even VIP (imagine if you have to check-in&out in the normal counter). Once I came back, my credit card have been charged four times in 2 months!!!! My credit card company suggested me to cancel that card and register the new one instead.They need to improve their service seriously!!!!! Otherwise I will not come back again or even recommend to others definitely. It wasn't worth my money at all, I've paid over 220S$ for couple of hours stay exclusive of those 4 times overcharged!!!!!!",695
MBS,2,“horrible club floor”,"MBS is a great architectural masterpiece. The club rooms are spacious, there is a huge mall connected to the hotel via underground passageways, and best of all there is a 24 hour food court in the basement of the mall. But that's where the fun ends. The club floor lounge closes as early as 7pm, and is then reopened to the public! I was hoping for a lounge where I could quietly enjoy the evening, get some free beer, check my email or gaze at the skyline. There was none of that. The entire rooftop garden is a zoo. The pool if almost always full. The rooftop corridor is jammed with gawkers. The only quiet place i could find was in the gym.Worst of all, there is a long queue for breakfast - perhaps 15 to 20 minutes at times, as they do not have enough tables to service everyone. Either there are too many club rooms, or they do not have enough tables in the breakfast area. The breakfast spread is disappointing, especially for an Asian hotel. Any 5 star hotel breakfast spread in the Philippines, Thailand, or Malaysia would put the MBS breakfast to shame. You can't even pour your own OJ or Fruit Juice - access to the juices are controlled - you need to ask the waiter for more drinks. And that is if you can get a hold of a waiter quickly! The spread is more consistent with hotels in Europe or the US (undermanned and overstressed service crew). We arrived at 1030 am were told that check in to our Club Room would not be available till 3pm. Really? In a hotel this large, there was no other room available? My wife had to argue with the staff at the check in counter to allow us to be given access to the rooftop lounge while we were waiting for our room to be ready. I would have been livid if I had just come in from a long international flight. For USD$400/night one would expect much better service. Other hotels would have offered free temporary use of a smaller room, or a free massage at the SPA while we were waiting. Other hotels might have even offered a free upgrade to a better room.What shocked me the most was the cheap 2 star service. Check out time is at 11 am. But they actually lock you out at around 1030 am. Not only will you be unable to enter your room, you will also be unable to use the elevator (which requires a valid room key) to go the rooftop lounge. I was hoping to take a quick dip in the swimming pool (as I kept waiting all week for the pool to clear so I could do some laps - what a bad idea that was), but they locked me out before check out time! At the checkout counter, I overheard a guest complaining that he had been given a late checkout at 12 noon, yet he too had been locked out before 11 am. They have an afternoon tea at the Club Lounge from 2-4pm. The bad part is that they shutdown part of the breakfast area, and one has to queue as well to get a table between 2-4pm. This is really, really pathetic. I have never been to a club floor lounge where I had to queue, and I have been to many hotels all over the world. I have never been to a club floor lounge where access to beer & liquor was tightly controlled. And I have never been to a club floor lounge that shuts down at 7 pm. Pathetic! I will never stay in this hotel again. If you're a first timer in Singapore, take a cheaper room, and experience the grandeur, but take your meals elsewhere. Or wake up really early so you avoid the irritation of beginning your day by waiting in line for breakfast. Take a dip in the pool, marvel at the view, but go for a real swim elsewhere. Gawk at the high end shops in the model, but do your shopping for non-luxury items elsewhere.",165
MBS,2,“Just another number...”,"Hi All! when planning our honeymoon we thought we just had to stay at the Marina Bay Sands due to all the hype and amazing photography we had seen online. Well the pool is quite special (nothing to really lose sleep over) the service we received was so poor i just had to write a review! being honeymooners we received a plate with 4 complimentary chocolate pieces as big as a postage stamp! when i called to ask if we would be receiving anything further they replied with \its too expensive for the hotel to provide you with champagne!\""mind you we were staying in a SUITE!! i cant begin to tell you the amount of stress caused when we tried to book a limo to take us to the night zoo...totally incapable of booking it for us so we decided to take a taxi.we hear from locals that the Ritz Carlton is the place to stay so we know where we are going next time.....""",169
MBS,3,“MBS Vacation”,"We stayed at one of the club room at the 44th floor. The whole room smells like sewer. We complained to the front desk at VIP lounge about the problem. The cleaning staff came to look at it and she found out that it's coming from all the 3 drainage outlets inside the bathroom. They plugged the two drains inside the toilet and by the lavatory. Unfortunately the smell is still coming out from the shower area, obviously they can't plug the drain inside the shower because we used it everyday. The problem is not fixed by the time we checked out.We feel very offended when we are complaining about the problem because the staff at the VIP lounge are talking in their local dialect, we don't know what they are talking about.The Club Lounge is Great. Although the staff were overwork they still gave us a good service.The front desk and staff at the Club Lounge are polite, industrious, helpful and hardworking... Always good service with a smile.",853
MBS,2,“A Majestic Hotel With Disappointing Service”,"It was quite some time that I last stayed in this hotel and the reason why it took so long for me to review this hotel really disappoint me.I and my partner stayed in this hotel on 23.12.11-24.11.11 on a club room. Our expectations for this hotel is simply exhilarating since it is one of the iconic hotels at Singapore. We checked in at the VIP check in side. It was quite a queue when we arrived but the queue was rather fast. A chinese lady served us and seemed rather unfriendly (either because i'm local or she's just having a bad day) but do serve us quickly and do explain to us all the necessary benefits of the club room and the sky park access.We proceed on to our room. Honestly from all the hotels that i've reviewed in Tripadvisor this room is considered as average. I still prefer my corporate suite room at Naumi Hotel. However, the toilet in the club room is fantastically commendable. Its really huge. The view was the bay view but we could not see much as its the raining season.There are some technical glitch on the television side, made a phone call and the technical team came in a jiffy. The bed was comfortable enough for a good sleep. The hotel itself is huge and you do have to find your way around to get to the mall or to the desired eateries. Went to the Club at the skypark for our cocktail hours. I must say its rather classy. Better than the one I had at Swissotel. Again, the staff there are really lacking of smiling and we feel we are in an unfriendly zone area.I did not had a chance to try the pool as it was crowded but definite the view was fantastic.The breakfast spread was generally acceptable except for the staff serving us..At this time i am really wondering if only tourists will get exceptional treatments here at this hotel.Checking out was a breeze with the invoice prepared for us.Worst dismay is around 2 days after i left the hotel and the hotel that i've booked for a new yea'rs eve staycation called me and told me that deduction via my card was unsuccessful. I was embarrassed and surprised as i knew i had calculated correctly for both staycations. Hence, I went to check with the bank and realized that Marina Bay Sands had deducted amounting to $1,600 when my invoice is accumulative to $800 only. My hotel reservation with the other hotel was dropped off due to a high demand of waiting list. I called MBS and explain the matter, believe me, till now, I could not remember how many times my calls was transferred to get this matter right. The person attending to me do admit it is the staff's fault and the thing that explodes me to the max when the person ask me to call the bank myself to query this matter. I was wondering, its MBS mistake, why am I doing the calling. I called the bank only having the bank to ask me to inform MBS to call the bank personally. Do take note all this happen for 1 whole day all the transferring of calls until I think the whole Finance of MBS knows my name. I was very angry with all the messy arrangements to get this matter right and request to talk to a higher management. I was transferred to Miss Namasita if i'm not wrong and get a calm explanation from me and mention the unauthorised deduction will be credited back on the next day which i do mention its not going to be of any use as all my new years eve plans had been ruined. She told me that she will talk to higher authority and tell me if there is anything that she could do to accomodate me. She called me in half hour's time and say 'for your case, the best we could do, your next stay with us will be a stay at club's room with deluxe room rate, but not now, for next year (2012)'.I drop an email to her to inform me if there is any last minute cancellation at MBS for New year's eve, do drop me an email but total silence from MBS and am totally disappointed with how they treat patrons or should i say ex-patrons to the hotel who is already disappointed with their mistake.After nearly a year gone by, for this year, I give this hotel another try and emailed to Miss Namasita to enquire if the offer last year still exist...silence..talking about sincerity and giving best service to customers??Really disappointing...I am not saying do not stay in this hotel, it is a real iconic hotel here in Singapore, but I do hope the management do something with the communication area between the staff and the hotel patrons itself. At times, its never only about the how well advanced or iconic the hotel is to make one's stay memorable, how the staff treats us, it makes a huge difference...Just saying.",168
MBS,3,"“Good location, nice room BUT BAD SERVICE”","I was promised an upgrade and free breakfast for 2 nights for me and my wife based on some promotion they sold me on when i was making the booking with them via phone directly. When i got to the hotel, lines were too long for check in. Then they said upgrade only on availability which was not conveyed when i booked the hotel. they said no breakfast when i checked in which was not what they told me as well. It seems like they were just trying to oversell me over the phone. I had to fight for the breakfast and they said 1 night only after i kept complaining. Not something i wanted to waste my time on my vacation, but it was a turn off. I think they are understaff. Some of the staff at the restaurant were a bit rude and not friendly. I guess they get so many customers per day, they dont care for service. i would think twice about staying here.",166
MBS,3,“big hotel geared towards conventions and mass group stays”,"Decent for a hotel of this size but plagued with service issues. The lines are check-in are HUGE - even at 5am. (note, taking a taxi instead of the shuttle bus can help). The lines are also confusing - there is one for club guests and one for those who booked online but then only a single desk is open, very strange. I also ran into a situation where I had prepaid for breakfast but then was told I didn't and when I asked to speak to the manager was told I couldn't! Apparently the staff really, really churns. If you really want to see the infinity pool on the top floor (cool but packed even at 7am so get there at 6 if you really want to swim!), you could stay there but you can also go as a day guest.The room I was in had a really odd brownish hand-print on the ceiling. I tried telling the housekeeping service but not sure it translated.",191
MBS,3,“Big Hype- City View lives upto the expectation...Service is poor”,"Marina bay sands is a hotel which has created a big hype. City view and swimming pool is as great as you hear about it. However, hotel reception, lobby, service culture of the people is very poor (one feels you are at a busy airport without any major care for customers).It is a good experience to visit once. Not sure if its worth the price because of service standards/ culture.Guess staff is too busy to handle customer volume with the service quality one would expect.It feels like ambience of Singapore Airlines with service standards of Ryanair (Ryanair tops the global worst list of Airline for poor service, delayed flights, bad attitude of staff, etc)For example- I had specifically instructed to provide me with a Non-Smoking room on a higher floor for the category of room choosen by me. Is that too much to ask? I was given exactly what i didnt want- a smoking room at lowest floor possible under that category. It took me 2 hours and almost 4/ 5 calls to get this fixed. Again baggage handling service, etc was of real disappointment. Staff just doesnt believe in curtousy.",676
MBS,3,"“Nice Room, Great View, Very Average Check In/Out Service, Not-So-Warm Staffs.”","In general, our stay at the hotel was rather pleasant and the only annoying part of the whole journey was how disconnected the front desk was when we were checking in. After a tedious long trip (when it involved very young children), we would expect the check in to be nothing else but quick and smooth. However, we had to wait nearly 30minutes to have this sorted out. Not pleasant at all. There were not enough sofas/chairs to sit while waiting to top that off.We stayed in Tower A on the 28th floor. We paid a little bit more to get the Premier Deluxe room and boy it was good decision, because the room was really chic and nice. It wasn't a big room, but fortunately we could squeeze a baby cot in there. The view was sea facing and that was also a good idea because that intrigued my son with the view of the \Garden By The Bay\"" and the sea vessels at anchorage point. So there were many vessels and floating lights at night - and can be rather magical. Apparently, the city facing views are good as well - but more costly. The toilet has a modern feel to it. A bit tub and rather high. So when you step out, becareful not to slip and fall. Next to the tub was the shower, separated with the sinks, by a piece of glass. So it's feels very open, and even more so, when the sliding toilet door is not lockable. We did not try the food at the restaurants, but we had dine in services. Like most hotels in Singapore, the Steamed Chicken Rice was nice, and the morning dine in breakfast (in bed) was also awesome. The kids were so comfortable with the arrangement, and in the privacy of our room. So in general, I think the in-room dining should be rather good, if you are lazy to go out to search for food. OK, now the most exciting part of the hotel. The infinity pool and it's engineering marvel. This is true - it being an engineering marvel. This was the 2nd time I was at the Sky Park. When it was initially opened, it was strange to be walking through the pool area with Hotel Patrons in their suits swimming on one side. Then in quiet corners, you would see the jacuzzi. So I initially shrugged to go up because the pool area was rather public, but later found out that now that has changed. Only patrons could get into the pool area, so that's more exclusive and private (not so public). It was raining when we were there, so the pool water was cold. But before we got in, we saw small kids and adults swimming as if it was a hot sunny day, so we thought the pool was a heated pool. It's not heated, but it sure was fun to swim there. Had the \""must-take-photo\"" at the pool and yes the view was awesome. Back to the park whereby I think that's open the public at a cost, the walk up there was magnificent. We were also there at night, and the sky line of Singapore from there was invigorating. When we checked out - the service was surprisingly better. They still took 20mins though. Retrieving your luggage from the bag room wasn't good either. I had to go into the room to identify my bags. If you like shopping - there's a very nice mall next to the hotel. High end products though. Do note that it's not like Orchard Rd., so hop on a cab. Location is great, when you intend to be just around that area. Would I go back there? Maybe not for a while. I have \""done and bought the T-Shirt\"", so perhaps I will go back there again if MBS hosts really nice musicals or when I have a lot more moolah to shop or the service and warmth of the staff greatly improved (the greatest pull factor of mine).""",349
MBS,1,“Worst customer service in Singapore”,"Im a regular traveller to Singapore on business and occasionally pleasure. This was a business trip. I have stayed at all the major hotels in Singapore and I generally think the standard is fantastic and have never even considered writing a negative review on any of them. MBS did not tick any of the boxes. Check in was incredibly slow (even though I understand I was lucky and there was no queue), upon arrival I placed my suit in for express pressing. As I had been travelling I was extremely tired so put my do not disturb light on at 9pm. I received a phonecall after 10pm to say my suit was outside and they couldn't deliver it because of the do not disturb sign. Incredible as it ruined my sleep and left me battling terrible jet lag for my trip. The only room they had for me was on the 1st floor facing the highway and the noise was terrible. The windows just do not seem to be sound proof enough. My friend who checked in at the same time was on the 38th floor and he said the noise from one of the night clubs was equally annoying. The laundry was very slow and I had to chase on two occassions. Basically cusotmer service seems to require an overhaul at this hotel. I was due to stay for 1 week but checked out after 2 nights and moved to the Fairmont on bras basah road, what a relieving difference. To top off the experience, when I got to check out the queue was huge and as I had to get to the office as well as check in to my new hotel I used the express check out service. This was one month ago, I have received no bill. The charges against my card are still too much. I have sent two emails and they have responded to neither. I suggest to anyone to stay somewhere else and visit the skypark or casino separately. Incredibly disappointed and I am having the establishment removed from our corporate list.",1640
MBS,2,"“Lavish Digs, But Hold Your Wallet”","Marina Bay Sands is an $8 Billion fantasyland for millionaires, built and run by Sands Las Vegas, only about a year and a half old. With over 2,500 rooms, a casino with 1,000 tables and 1,400 slot machines, a theater, a shopping mall with over 300 stores featuring only high end brands, and some of the most expensive and famous restaurants in Singapore, the place is massive, lavish, and just packed with people. Don't come to Marina Bay Sands with empty pockets, they will need to be deep for everything you do, everything you eat, and everything you buy. The expensive hotel rooms are just a drop in the money bucket you will spend after a few days here. Despite the lavish restaurants, shops and design, the actual hotel part of the experience is quite ho-hum, and the service is very disappointing for a hotel of this price range.You are truly just a number here, one of thousands of walking dollar signs, and you leave feeling like you wished you'd stayed somewhere else.LOCATION - Marina Bay Sands is located across the Bay from the Fullerton Hotel, on Singapore's ritzy bayfront. Right next door is the Bayside Gardens. There is really nothing else within walking distance outside of the hotel so you are limited to its sprawling confines. You can take a taxi to get somewhere else. Orchard Rd is about 10 minutes by taxi, Chinatown about the same. The ferris wheel is next door as well.ATTRACTIONS - Aside from the restaurants, casino, theater, the world's highest infinity swimming pool, a night club, and shops, there is also a museum next door and the Bayside gardens to see, and the ferris wheel to ride. There is a light show on the water twice a night too, kind of Vegas-style. Of course the spa too - where a simple haircut costs $160.00 plus 10% service charge, plus 7% tax.ROOMS - We had a city view premier room, ran about $400.00. The room's highlight is floor to ceiling windows with a view over the bay toward the city skyline. That was really nice. The room was spacious, comfortable, but simply designed - nothing different than you'd find at any Hilton or Sheraton, quite ho-hum other than the view. The TV stopped working for our last couple days, the internet in this room is free for 24 hours, but was intermittent and kept cutting in and out. The wi-fi was pretty slow, though there is wired ethernet which was a bit better.The bathrooms were large with a nice tub and separate shower and toilet and double sinks. The only problem was the shower had very little water pressure, with a cheesy shower head to try to give the weak water enough boost you could actually shower. Very poor for the price range of the room.There is a mini-bar with exorbitantly priced items that automatically charge you if you remove them. The bed was pretty comfortable, but nothing especially luxurious. The pillows were soft and nice though. Nothing wrong with the rooms, comfortable enough, just nothing special, at a high price. However, the view over the bay is nice. You don't get a good view of the light show on the water from the room, you will need to go outside.FOOD - There are a lot of restaurants, but you have to walk a really long way to get to any of them. The only one near our tower, Rise, was $40.00 for breakfast, and when we went for lunch, the dim sum was totally inedible, had obviously been sitting in the buffet for ages and reheated, mushy and gross. We sent it back, took forever to come back, which the waitress took without a word (we didn't know what was going on) then when it did, half of it was cold, obvious it hadn't been replaced. On top of that the manager made a snide remark when giving it to us. Still inedible, but do you think they took it off the bill? No. Not even an apology. Guy Savoy is one of 7 celebrity chef restaurants at Marina Bay Sands. It's devoid of ambience, located inside a shopping mall, with a view of the Ferrari Store and walkways, but still apparently feels it is worth meals that usually run up near the $1,000 range for a dinner for two. Absurd. Nearby pizza place (also Celebrity Chef) was really quite bad - mushy crust, not good taste - still left with a $200 bill after a bottle of wine and two small pizzas. You can have breakfast downstairs or upstairs for about $40 per person. The other specialty chef restaurants are also in the high 3-digits to eat at. You can grab a steak at Wolfgang Puck for upward of $150.00 per plate. There are a couple casual bistros outside with really bad food and service for \only\"" about $150.00 for two. One has a burger for \""only\"" about $40.00. Want a drink? $45 a glass of wine at Guy Savoy, or a little less around $30 for a glass at some of the other lesser places. The only place to get even remotely reasonably priced food is way down at the end of the mall at the food court, which is pretty nice - but still, it's a food court, and it takes you like a half hour to walk there from Tower 1. STAFF - You are truly just a number here, a walking dollar sign. Staff was responsive to our requests, and most staff was decently friendly when approached. Housekeeping was good, but no turndown service was very disappointing for such a pricey hotel. Poor service at most of the restaurants was also disappointing. Most disappointing of all was when after staying 6 nights and spending a fortune, we asked to extend our stay for 3 more nights (due to a visa problem we had to sort out), and were informed we would have to pay the \""walk-in rate\"" which was much higher than even their listed rates on their website, let alone what we paid. Fine. We checked out an hour later and were off to spend our money elsewhere. Made me really wish we'd done that from the beginning. Certainly our travel agency will not be recommending Marina Bay Sands to Singapore visitors after that. Very poor policy. Just shows how little they really care that you're unloading your wallet at their place.SERVICES - There is laundry service where you can pay $20.00 for one pair of pants to be washed. There is a spa where you can pay $160.00 for a haircut. There is a night club on the roof where there is a $2,500 minimum charge if you want a seat. There is a big infinity pool on the roof where photographers take your photo and try to sell it to you for $135 for a CD of a few photos they took with their waterproof camera. Great views from the pool, but it's quite cold so not a lot of people were swimming. Just a quick photo and out. LIGHT SHOW - There is a twice-nightly laser light show on the bay. It is free and lasts 15 minutes. Best views of it are either outside right in front of the hotel or on the other side of the bay at one of the restaurants there. Not a good view from the hotel rooms, you miss a lot.CASINO - The casino is pretty big, plenty of very tight slots where you have fairly high minimum bets, also every table game is pretty much represented here. 24 hours. Three noodle bars inside. You have to show a foreign passport to avoid paying the $100 entrance fee.THEATER - We saw Jersey Boys at the theater, which was ok. Air Supply was playing the same night, we passed on that. Theater has minimal slope so get a seat in the front of your section to avoid looking through heads. Pretty small, no bad seats really.BUSINESS - Big desk for working in the room, but facing the wall instead of the view and difficult to move. Wi-fi in the room was free but intermittent, dropping in and out all the time. Wired connection was faster and more consistent. Conference rooms galore, no problem to do business here except the wi-fi not working that well and of course the distractions.SHOPPING - The whole mall is filled with every high-end chain store you can think of, with prices that seem much higher than even normal for these places. Half the stores are jewelry stores (Tiffany's and the like). Kind of ho-hum because every major city and half the airports in the world are stuffed with these same stores nowadays, so while glitzy it was kind of boring to see just a bunch of chain stores all over. We'd walk through the mall from one end to the other and note that we never saw a single shopper in any of the stores despite thousands of people all over. Marina Bay Sands is fine for a night or two on a quick weekend getaway to gamble, dine at fancy restaurants that cost a month's salary for one meal and to buy fancy handbags at Louis Vuitton that I guess are different than the Louis Vuitton in your city. But after a couple nights it gets old. Huge, impersonal, poor service, ho-hum chain hotel rooms (although good views), walking eons to get any food (breakfast not included in room rate), and ridiculous prices on everything, then to be kind of spit on when you suck it up and offer to spend more money there, just not somewhere I would recommend or go back to. Interesting to see, but you can visit it during the day or night and sleep elsewhere. I know we will.""",295
MBS,3,“Beautiful but Over-rated”,"Travelled with a family of 6 including a 3month old baby. Stayed 2 nights in a connecting room. The Good - The Skypark was indeed one of a kind, and the views were astounding. The pool was really beautiful overlooking Singapore city. The rooms were clean and housekeeping staff were courteous.The Bad - Check-in was painfully slow. For the room price, i don't consider this a luxury or 5 star hotel because the rooms and amenities are pretty basic. This is not a child-friendly property. The biggest problem was needing to use the fridge to store expressed breastmilk but i couldn't use the fridge because the fridge in the room were stocked and should you so much as remove the item from the fridge, you will be charged automatically. I asked if there are any solution to my problem, i was told to rent a fridge for SG$20 a day! Because i brought my own icepacks and cooler box, i asked if they could assist to re-freeze my icepacks and the answer was - rent the fridge! The infinity pool is not for kids who can't swim, and (tube) floats were not allowed for my 7 and 9 year old children. Even a baby floater for my 3month old weren't allowed. Dining and drinks at the Ku De Ta ( Skypark) were short of expectations given the high price. Shopping for labels and dining were aplenty at The Shoppes located below the hotel. The food court was clean and nice, offering affordable dining options but taste-wise is debatable. You won't go wrong with crowd instincts - go for stalls with a long que. The Malaysian food stall is recommended.Marina Bay Sands is indeed a wonderland for adults and not recommended for families with young children.",258
MBS,3,“Wonderful Singapore Experience”,"It was our first time to travel to Singapore. I booked via their internet website, it was a breeze and got their discounted price.Upon arrival at Terminal 1 of Changi Airport, we found the complimentary shuttle bus and it left on time even though it was only 3 of us at 8:30 am. The concierge staff are very attentive and we left our bags since we could only check in after 3pm. When we came back after going around, checking in was quick. We stayed in a premium room facing city views with complimentary internet. Only catch is their mini-bar which has a sensor and you will be automatically billed once you move any item. Reception staff at Tower 1 on check in was polite and helpful, however, Tower 3 check out staffs are very busy and hardly smile, maybe due to the sheer volume of guests going out. The infinity pool was breathtaking, especially when you go to the edge and you are in a very unique spot in the world were the views are spectacular. It was an awesome experience. The shops and food court are a treat, with plenty choices. Transport was a breeze, taxis are readily available & train station was a few walks away. Almost anything you need is available and no need to go out of your way except for sight seeing. The free 8:30pm Wonder Full Light show was also a feast for the eyes. All in all, what an experience and it was worth the price for first time visit.",78
MBS,1,“Its size is its downfall”,"US$430 a night - free bus from the airport (great), dropped of in the carpark, carry all your bags like 500m to try find check-in, huge queue, heres the keys, find your room, (carry your bags another 500m), nothing special about room itself (views are amazing), checkout huge queues, you get the picture.5 star facilities with 1 star service. They are having a laugh with what they chargeDinner; 1 pizza, 1 plate of olives, 1 coke = US$65",276
MBS,3,“The pool and the view are the main features. Everything else is ordinary.”,"Decided to splurge and stay at MBS for a short break. The complimentary shuttle pick up from Changi was great, especially since we were almost about to miss the last bus for the night!Upon arrival we were greeted rather abruptly by the front desk attendant who, after searching furiously for a room, informed us that the only king room available was on level two (above the lobby). We took it and walked in to find it was beside the highway (roaring traffic and shrubbery trying to disguise this). This was completely unacceptable considering the nightly rate, so we opted for a twin room on the 18th floor. This also faced the highway and was very noisy. It was extremely difficult to have a restful night's sleep. Thankfully, I wasn't willing to accept this and the next day there were more available rooms, so we moved to a room facing the city on the 33rd floor.The floor at the rooftop is amazing and you can stare at the view for hours. I find it tacky that they bring visitors through to the pool area (hotel guests only) for photo opportunities and they actually charge the public for this privilege. You do have to remember that the main money-maker of MBS is the casino, the hotel operation is secondary to this. Try the coffee shop underneath tower 3 - the best place for a morning coffee and croissant if you don't want to pay the exorbitant restaurant prices.Good to experience for once but we will definitely stay somewhere else in Singapore that provides the kind of service you expect and pay for when staying at a five-star property.",211
MBS,1,“Most lousy service experience”,"I have stayed in MBS many times and the worst I had was last Saturday 10/11/2012. 1. The check-in @ the Paiza was slow and there is a lack of product knowledge of the customer service. Rooms are designed in various layout and the CSO dun seem to know anything2. Rooms were not ready when we checked in. CSO promised to call when the room is ready but I had to make the call myself instead.3. @ The Club restaurant, I asked for warm water to make my milk for my hungry baby (due to the delay upon check-in) but hot water was being served instead.4. Asked again for warm water & took ages for the water to come.5. My hubby and I ordered our tea. Half an hour passed, asked a waiter and he wanted us to wait patiently. It really boiled us down as the patrons who came later than us, had their tea served already. And to make matter worse, there was NO ONE preparing tea at the tea counter.We had to ask another waiter AGAIN and we then saw him walking towards the tea counter to prepare our tea.This is extremely outrageous!Despite the good service after that, the upfront service had spoiled our stay from the beginning.",83
MBS,3,"“Commercialised, huge and busy.”",The Marina Bay Sounds is just what you would expect of such a huge enterprise. We had a club room and the staff were attentive in the club but the sheer numbers of people passing through meant that the service was efficient but impersonal. The food in the club was very good and we were pleasantly surprised. This is an expensive hotel and whilst the sky park is memorable it is very busy and I don't think the overall experience is anything startling.,258
MBS,3,"“Potentially great hotel, but lacks soul”","I stayed in an Orchid Suite at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel with my husband. It was amazing, the rooms were enormous, the views were unbelievable (52nd floor looking over the new Gardens at the Bay), the staff were friendly and helpful, the food was great, but it ultimately lacked soul. Our room was not available until 6pm, so we were compensated with a $100 voucher, I would have preferred the room. Once we checked out, it was if we never existed. The hotel offers a waiting room for guests who have late flights, to cut a very long story short, the key they gave us did not work, but our travelling companion was given another room, so we joined him. A hotel employee made my husband and I leave the empty room and took us to the other room, which turned out to be packed to the rafters with adults and children, with nowhere to sit. I said that we needed to be with our travelling companion as we had no means of contact, as the 24 hour internet access I had signed up for 12 hours before, had stopped on checkout. I gave up and went to the VIP Lounge in some distress. It was if I never existed. They did give me a new key to the packed room, but told me we could not join our companion in the empty room. Great way to spoil a stay. We had stayed at Raffles on a stopover the previous week, wish I had stayed there again.",304
MBS,3,“Average for the expected standard”,"As expected, the room, view and rooftop swimming pool were magnificent, but the little things irked, which should not be the case for a 5 star hotel.We had a late check-out set at 1pm, so spent a last leisurely morning at the rooftop pool, returning to our room at 12.15. The room key had been disabled, so we had to wait 10 minutes in the passageway, in our swimwear and towels, for a security guard to come and open our door. He was polite and apologetic, saying that it was only a computer glitch. Fine, but I did check at 12.45, and our room key had not been re-activated.Not a big deal, but not a 5 star response.The room fridge is totally stocked with drinks, with no room to put anything of your own in it. If you remove anything from the fridge a sensor immediately bills you for it. Great automation for instant invoicing, but not good customer service. A 5 star hotel would either leave space for the guest to use, or provide a 2nd fridge for the purpose. We would have preferred to have our water bottles chilled before heading out to the adjoining \Gardens by the Bay\"", which are new and well worth the visit.The lobby is narrow and can be very crowded. Rather than have breakfast, or any other meal in the cafes here, I highly recommend walking to the Rasapura food court in the attached magnificent shopping centre. In fact, there are so many great restaurants of every description in the shopping centre that there is no temptation to eat in the hotel at all.The only reason to stay at this hotel is to have convenient access to the casino, malls and gardens. I would rate this a good but expensive 4 star hotel, in the right place.""",45
MBS,1,“Poor service.”,"Don't bother coming to check in at the 3pm check in time. We've been here twice and both times rooms aren't available until 5pm. This coupled with early check out means you're actually paying more money per hour of stay, at this already expensive hotel.",43
MBS,3,"“Overrated, but nice for singapore”","Infinity pool is only 3 fot deep. The roms are new, but not huge in size. The local restaurants are as expesive as youd expect in a casino, but a far way from any of the cheap eateries as youd expect from singapore.",92
MBS,3,“One-stop holiday destination...”,"Here are some tips when staying at this huge hotel:a. stay from Sun or Mon, this you will avoid the crowdb. ask for room facing the Straits of Malaccab. use the express check-out to beat the quec. avoid using the pool on weekends, it's bumper-to-bumper!d. try the a la carte breakfast on Sky 57...breathtaking view!e. avoid KuDeTa, too crowded espcially eveningsf. if you use the MRT, do not stop or get off at Marina Bay, hotel is located at Bayfront station!g. free shuttle to airport is a plus! runs every 30 mins",107
MBS,1,"“Great Pool and Views, everything else is dire”","Too crowded, not enough staff, not relaxing, check in awful . Do not make up room unless you call them (but do not tell you this) Information about facilities only available on TV which is not the most convenient, lift control by very poor card access system when for this modern a building you would expect at least a proximity card system. Staff generally helpful but overwhelmed. Quality and finish of room good but a/c noisy. bed comfortably. Restaurants over priced, house wine only available by glass or magnum. Truly an odd hotel best left to tourists on an overnight deal. I will return to the Mandarin",177
MBS,3,“Luxury but impersonal”,"We were looking forward to our stay at one of their Orchid Suites but have to say we were a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong; the facilities are awesome; especially the infinity pool and the building in general; breakfast food is good, as are the complementary drinks and treats at cocktail hour. However, it seems the service has really suffered; it was superficial and not all that attentive. We contacted room service a few times without getting what we asked for; our check-in didn't quite work out; and we missed most of the \suite\"" perks as nobody told us about them. The Orchid Suite was roomy but not as good as you would expect for this kind of a hotel and at this kind of a price. Somewhat disappointed, but the pool almost makes up for this. Gladly we only booked this for two nights, not more! And the room clearly smelled of smoke although it was a non-smoking floor; and nobody (staff) seemed even vaguely interested in this fact. I would say a service failure.""",121
MBS,1,“reservation is a mess”,"reservation system in a total mess, bookings take a whole day to get confirmed.customer service through email take a whole day to respond.I booked 2 rooms, but got charged for 3 rooms prepaid... and when I called, they even denied it and told me to print my bank statement.. what a jokethis hotel need to upgrade to a better reservation system, its a joke that a hotel of 2500 rooms still uses manual reservation system.basically you only pay for the view, customer service is close to none, YOU HAVE TO DRAG UR OWN LUGGAGE TO YOUR ROOM!

MBS,3,“What a let down!”,"This is apparently a 5 star hotel... How, I am not sure. Our room was in Tower 3, 6th floor. The furniture was brown, looked old, and the room was as basic as could be. I would never have guessed that this was a new hotel by looking at the room. The bed/pillows were so uncomfortable my part and I both work up with our necks out, and grumpy lol.Just by the room I would say this hotel needs to be rated 3 stars. On the 57th floor is the infinity pool. I have to admit, this is the only reason we stayed at the hotel. That was awesome, great idea, great view, and was just something orginal. I would rate the hotel 4 stars only becuse of the pool.Breakfast was one large area for guests from all 3 towers to eat. It was a zoo. First you had to wait in line for 5-10 minutes to be seated, and then you had to fight your way past people to get to the buffet, and it was just insane. The last thing you want when you're on holiday is to feel like you have to eat breakfast quickly because there are people waiting for you to finish so they can get your table. Too crowded, not at all well organised and definitely not customer driven. Upon check-out the girl at the desk asked me if I would return, I said no. She asked if I would recommend the hotel, I said no, but because of the pool, I would say to my friends - \Stay for one night, one night only, see the pool, and get out!\"".""",535
MBS,3,“Too ... much ?”,"As this is the first half of my trip in SIN, I thought it will be fun for my kids to enjoy this property. Since there are already so many reviews, I will only highlight my thoughts on a few things (but bear in mind that I was here at peak season during the week before National Day and there was a parade rehearsal):size - the property is ridiculously BIG for a city hotel and chaos is the only word I can describe it. The moment you are dropped off at the driveway (which is a line of cabs and cars waiting to drop guests off) all the way to the elevators, the amount of people is really something. What is worse is that there is a Cafe right outside the 3 sets of elevators so another good location as a hang out spot for the crowd.Security - there is 2 guards to each elevators who are supposed to check your ID before going to your room or to guide you to the right spot. With that big of a crowd and commotion, these poor fellas aren't able to do anything but just spot check a few people as a courtesy, the rest of the people rushing to the elevators were not stopping.Gym - I was in the last tower but the gym is not accessible (located in Tower 2) unless you go via the lobby elevators or via the skybridge. This means I have to either take the lifts down or up before changing to a different set of elevators in my gym outfit, trying to fight my way out of the crowd to get to the gym. The gym itself is GREAT ! The view is good even if it only looks out towards CBD area but coz it is floor to ceiling glass windows, it just feels good for a city hotel not to feel like u r crammed into a basement. It is a good size and I love the cold towels in the fridge as well as bottled water after a good work out. Only thing is, even if they were not working out, there were tons of people/guests who just walked in and took a look around, took some apples and some water bottles to go. They weren't exactly quiet either. Some just sat down at the reception area and chatted. Cafe - way overpriced for so-so pastries esp. the madeleines and also too crowded, people were spilling outside of the cafe and closer to the elevators so blocking the entrance when you are trying to get back to your roomShopping/Casino area - took a walk and came back as quickly, right after I got tired of fighting the crowd just to get to the food court (which is worse then Hong Kong food court during lunch time which is to say a lot, there were no space for even standing room !) It is a maze packed with luxury brands to get you to spend more $Room - The room is nice but for the price, I was expecting more Overall, I dont think I will return to this property as it just doesn't fit into our lifestyle.",246
MBS,2,“Pretend 5 star hotel for mass tourism”,"This a 3 star hotel dressed up in 5 star clothes. Nothing about the experience is 5 star at all. This is evidenced even by the large bold letters on Tripadvisor saying \Web Specials from S$339\"". They bring in low class tourists by the busload and if you're paying extra for a mega suite they treat you as such. I asked the concierge to get me a reservation at one of the cities many roof top bars, he said he would \""check if he could do that\"" and then called back to say that all of them \""declined to do a favor for the marina bay sands\"" and reserve me a table. I then asked him to get me a reservation on the hotel's own roof top bar to which he responded \""the hotel doesn't own that bar\"" and when I insisted he said he would \""check with the management\"" - he called back five minutes later to say there is a private function but I could get in if I pay $38 cover (yea right, a private function but open to the public if you pay!). I then went to 1 Altitude which was one of the bars I specifically asked him to get me a reservation and he said \""declined his request for a favor\"" and it was absolutely dead empty. This is a typical example of the kind of service you can expect in Singapore - which is to say bad or none.""",47
MBS,3,“Architecturally Marvelous”,"Stayed there for 4 nights with rest of the family at a premiere room,very good location.Alot of food choices at their mall.Architecturally Marvelous,the infinity pool is very nice.Food in the hotel is just so-so.Nothing spectacular about the room.We have stayed in better hotel rooms. A bit overpriced.",177
MBS,3,“Great facilities; Poor reception”,"The Sands ought to be doing better considering that they are such well built. We arrived 4:30pm at the hotel to be told the room was not ready. We were at Tower 3, and we couldn't even find a proper lobby or sofa to sit. So we had to wait standing! And finally got our keys at 5:15pm. The check out time was 11:00am. I had to attend a conference, so my wife had to check out for us. She carried one heavy bag to Tower 3 where we checked in only to be told that check out was at Tower 1 which was about 500 metres - 800 meters away. And what a sight she saw. Massive crowds, all checking out at the same time with only maybe 5-6 crews at reception -- the same people who checked us in... And the crowds were all lost and without a clue, queues were long, confused faces, crew member trying to get some of them to try 'express check-out' but was failing badly.... Sands should be doing better.",605
MBS,3,“Infinity pool amazing but the size of the place means service is lacking”,"I booked this direct with the hotel booking a deluxe room and requesting a high floor. I also said that there was a chance I would want to do the half-day rate the following day as my flight wasn't until 11pm that night.I was checked in by admittedly a friendly and welcoming guy but he tried to put me in room inferior to what I had booked. As if that wasn't bad enough he claimed he had given me \an upgrade and a one time only upgrade\"" at that. I directly asked him if it was better than the room I had booked and he said yes. It was only thanks to an exceptionally helpful bellboy that I found out the \""upgraded room\"" was terrible. I found this out as I happened to ask him to direct me to the relevant lift and when he saw the room number he said \""go back and change it that's a dreadful room on the 2nd floor overlooking a busy road and directly above where the band plays live music\"".Now, admittedly I did get a better room on the 37th floor but when I opened the door and went in it was clearly set up for a wedding couple! The beds were draped in red petals and there were chocolate dipped strawberries on the side with an envelope addressed to the people who were supposed to be staying in the room!Having now checked in over 40 minutes previously I decided to do nothing and just make sure the door had the dead bolt on it when I shut it that night!!!!I had issues with the key card not working in the lift and my biggest issue was that the toilet didn't flush properly in a £300 a night room! I didn't do anything about this as to be honest I couldn't be bothered - after all I was only there for 24 hours and didn't want to spend it fixing issues with the room and the booking! On check out I did raise it and they were very good at trying to rectify things when they heard of the issues I'd had. The Front Desk Manager Yenni was very helpful and gave me a complimentary room for 2 hours at 5.30pm so that I could freshen up and have a shower before leaving for the airport. Given it was a 13 hour flight home to the UK this was much appreciated.So, things I liked about the place....of course the incredibly infinity pool on the 57th floor and the fact you couldn't get into the area without a key card. This area was lovely and very well maintained and looked after. There was enough space to be able to not feel as though everyone was sitting on top of each other. I thought the Shoppes at Marina Bay were brilliant too and only a 5 minute walk from the hotel main lobby area. They have a fantastic food court too.Things I didn't like - the place is just too huge and lacking in character. It's so huge that service and the little things are lacking and it took me nearly 10 minutes to get from the front desk to my room - that becomes a major headache when things keep going wrong - like the key card not working.Overall this was an amazing hotel but that's pretty much down to the incredible infinity pool.I've stayed in 3 other hotels in Singapore on various trips and I'd return to one of these before I went back here based purely on how expensive it was an how poor the service was.""",211
MBS,3,“Huge room (w/o a tub?)”,"Stayed for 1 night (50th floor on Tower3) before heading to Thailand. We got the 1 bedroom with separate living room and enjoyed the huge space and the huge floor-to-ceiling window. Enjoyed the laser light show from the comfort of our room overlooking from our humongous window. Sumptuous buffet breakfast, breath-taking infinity pool, courteous and polite staff and free shuttle bus to the airport. Loved the huge, comfortable bed (and pillows) most of all plus complimentary TWG teas available. Amazed by how the building was made to a certain curved 90 degree-angle so that you can see the street just below your window. Negative side: Inspite of the huge room we had, we were surprised to find out that it didn't have a bath tub (for such a luxurious-looking room?), lobby and infinity pool was always jam-packed with guests and non guests, we were mixed with other guests in one circular table during our breakfast bec of limited availability of seats and also bec of such limited space for the restaurant and Kudeta serves over-priced, average-tasting food (there are lots of much better restaurants around). Overall, it was a 50-50 hotel when weighing the good and the bad (not to mention the exorbitant rates). Just thankful that the bed was heavenly!",121
MBS,2,“Over priced. Infinity pool is crowded like public swimming pool.”,"I stayed in many hotels in Singapore (business and leisure) and it is only my first time to write a review. I stayed in Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights and paid HK$6,500 (not including breakfast). I would expect something better. We checked in a non-smoking floor and the room was full of smell of cigarette. The safe deposit box could not be locked and and we called 3 times and needed to stay in the room to wait for the technician to fix it but still not able to get it fixed. The slippers, shampoo & conditioners looked like something from a 3 stars hotel. The Infinity pool enjoys good view, but it was full of people all day long.",208
MBS,3,"“Spectacular, but......”","Like many things in Singapore, the architecture of this hotel is spectacular. Stunning city view on downtown Singapore or the gardens depending on your room, breathtaking feeling swimming on the top of the building with the city view.... Now for the rest, we were disappointed: the prices are extremely high and you don't get anything else than an average 4 * hotel anywhere in the world. Modern, comfortable. And a few negative points for such a category of hotels: the staff is well trained, but for everything that is outside the training, you will get a smile and no support. An their English is far from perfect for many of them, making the communication impossible. Also, Singapore in an international city with a multi cultural society, and is visited by business men and tourists from all around the world. But among the poor 20 TV channels proposed in the rooms (approximately) you will hardly find BBC and CNN, but don't even dream of watching anything else in the other traditional foreign languages available in the international hotels: nothing in Spanish, Italian, German, French. And don't expect to use the internet instead: the bandwitch is limited and prevents watching anything in streaming.... So in summary, this hotel is overpriced.",92
MBS,1,“Shattered Dreams”,"I don't like making negative comments, however I don't think I should stay quiet.The room was of a very high standard. Luxurious, with a beautiful bathroom. Great view.The check-in was appalling. For pre-paid rooms it took forever.Queuing for a lift. There were 6 lifts.(and 3 towers) No staff to ask questions and no assistance.Every star rated restaurant booked out. The Club Lounge, queues to get in and to find a table.Just the most disappointing experience on every level..I would have walked out had I not pre-paid for 3 rooms...at $900 per room.",82
MBS,3,“It's probably a one off experience”,"We decided that it was something we had to do and we have done it. Huge hotel with a vibe of a busy airport. It's all a bit pedestrian really and the idea of the pool on the roof is a good one, but it really is a fad and not a fantasy.We were upgraded with our room, only to a huge room with mismatching minimal furniture and obviously a smokers room, which was unpleasant.The staff are attentive and do their best",237
MBS,2,“Really disappointing”,"What shall I say.... I've booked this hotel for a short vacation since I expected this to be THE attraction in Singapore. I should have known it better ......In a nutshell:- There are 2500 rooms, don't expect to be alone. Whereever you are,you have to queue. Reception, Lobby, Restaurant, Elevator, Pool entrance. Really cool- Pool area: There is space for about 200-300 people to comfortably relax around the pool. Reality is: There are about 400-600 people at least every day around the pool and a couple of hundered people in the pool. And guess what they do. Pictures, pictures, pictures. Already at 8am, the pool was full. Furthermore, in regular intervals, you have visitors coming up to view. One feels like in a shopping window- Due to the above, you always have to show room batch to enter pool area. Although reason is clear, it's annoying- Rooms are at best average. Never ever at a level with Mandarin or similar- Room light system is crap (Suite). Try to turn out the light in bathroom .....- We had an electricity outage on our floor (just a few rooms). When I called the lobby several times, noone took phone. Call was immediately put to the voice mail. I asked room service for help. Didn't help either- Have a look at details (flowers, cleanliness). You wont be amusedSorry to be that straight. I've experienced this. Make up your own view.",111
MBS,2,“Way too overcrowded/Excessive Opulence”,"The lobby is so crowded all day long that it became uncomfortable. Long queues of people waiting to check in at all hours with unruly, undisciplined kids all over the place running into you. It is just way too overcrowded and I woud not stay here again.The checkin process takes too long and so the queue just backs up all the way to the doors. The prices are overly inflated and nothing is cheap. The mall and restaurants are not great but the prices are very high. You do better to get a taxi and go eat somewhere else.On a good note, the staff was very helpful anytime I needed anything.",251
MBS,2,“Great potential but infrastructure and staff cannot cope with guest load”,"Stayed at a suite over the weekend. The suite itself was spacious and nice but there were just too many bad points about MBS as the infrastructure and staff obviously cannot cope with the large number of guests. 1) Check in/out: With a check in time of 3pm, MBS is already far lagging behind other hotels where check in time is usually 1pm. When we arrived at 3:30pm, the suite was STILL not ready, and we were told we had to wait for a further ONE hour. MBS needs to look into hiring more cleaning staff if they are unable to cope with the high turnover of guests. The queue to check out was terribly long, it made you forget u were paying top dollar for a five-star hotel and felt more like we were in a circus The lobby has too much walk through traffic making it very congested. It lacks the exclusivity and grandeur that you get when u enter other hotels like Four seasons or Hyatt. 2) Sky park and club at 57:Once again, over-congested. The pool is long enough but there are just too many guests giving most people wading space only. The club which offers free breakfast/tea/cocktails for suite guests has great potential. The food itself was good but once again, severe lack of space ensured long queues to get in if you don't arrive within the first hour. The only good thing about it is the spectacular view. Overall, poor value for the money spent.",593
MBS,2,“Nice room but service was extremely disappointing”,"Booked an Orchid Suite for my 21st birthday because of the good reviews ive heard about MBS from friends. No doubt the room was nice but everything else was subpar.I stepped into the hotel lobby and was obviously struggling with my heavy duffel bag but the doorman did not take any initiative to render any form of help. It was only as i was walking towards another door did a 2nd doorman come to my assistance. I thought it was just a once off incidence and brushed it off.We then went to the VIP lounge to check in but were told the rooms were not ready yet as the previous night was a full house and that they were rushing housekeeping to get the rooms ready. This was totally fine with us as we arrived early (1pm) and the stipulated time for check-in was 3pm. The staff then told us about the complimentary afternoon tea at the club and said they'll call once the room is ready.By the time we were done with tea, there was still no call so we went down again to check about the status of the room. To our disappointment, it was still not ready and it was already past 3pm. the staff member who served us then gave us a $50 F&B credit and told us to have a bite while waiting for the room to be ready. That was despite us telling him it is useless because we already had afternoon tea. We then asked how long more we had to wait and he said about 20mins.About 50mins later, we went back to the VIP lounge, and to our disappointment again, the room was still not ready. This was despite the fact that we were told 50mins ago that the room would be ready in 20mins. The staff member serving us then told us to take a seat and wait and gave us a letter which contained a list of benefits we would get as suite guests (which is, again, useless as we already knew all that on checking in) while another staff member went up to check on the room. It was only after a whole lot of time wasting seating in the VIP lounge (and after numerous requests to check if our room was ready) that they finally told us our room was ready. It was already 5pm then, 2 hours past the stipulated check in time. And even with that, the housekeeping lady (she was very friendly and nice) was still in our room when we entered. The bathroom floors felt very sandy but we excused her from further cleaning because we didnt want to be delayed further. it was my 21st birthday and i choose to spend it at MBS but the disappointments during check in just spoilt my mood for the entire night. The later 1pm check out time we were given was little consolation. I also did not see the difference between checking in at the VIP lounge and checking in at the main area for other room guests. The queue at the VIP lounge seemed as long, or maybe even longer, than at the main check in area.Check out also took a long time and it seems to be because of understaffing. The above experience left a bitter taste in my mouth and I find it unbecoming of a 5 star hotel. I could have easily paid less for similar room elsewhere. I would definitely not return for any events in future if the service standards do not improve.",206
MBS,3,“Truly below expectations”,"Booked the hotel trough Booking.com for 2 nights, received even an upgrade with great view to the botanic garden. The room was big but had several problems; dust and dirt behind the night table and a incredibly loud air-condition. Although the hotel is new, the furniture had lots of spots and locked as being used for years. But the worst was to come! Breakfast, I went to the buffet, got some rice and other food. Back on my table I discovered a long black hair sticking in the rice. I was shocked, showed it to the service personnel but besides an assurance from one of the managers that they would investigate how this was possible, nothing else was done. Well, they don’t have to investigate; it is just a lack of hygiene. Of course I refused to pay for the food as I did not eat at all, I could not, I was sick to the stomach. Then go a call from the company in HK, asking me to return immediately, so I checked out at 11:00 but the front desk manager refused to refund the second night which payment was guaranteed by booking.com. I found this service poor and not adequate, especially considering the price.",174
MBS,1,“Express Checkout Service - Anything but!”,"What could be a sensational hotel with the pool area and bar on the top floor, turns out be a bad experience due to extremely poor service - I wont be staying there again. I have stayed twice and nothing has improved in the year between. There is not enough staff at checkin or checkout - 2 people serving on each occasion for each tower. So the process is slow. if you use the express checkout where your bill is supposed to be emailed to you, be prepared to wait over 2 weeks, even though you have prompted MBS with emails and phone calls. Wait for the deafening silence when they cant explain why they charged you $250 too much. Ask for a non smoking room and then see what you get! Ask for a foam pillow, follow up with two requests - well it might come one day. Try to find a place to have a drink and snack after a late night flight arrival (12:30 into Changi) - better leave the hotel.",88
MBS,3,"“Nice looking, not so nice experience”","When you're up on on the 57th enjoying the spectacuar view from the infinity pool it's easy to forget the chaos that reigned on arrival. The check in process took just under an hour. I was given wrong directions to my room three time so it took well over half an hour to get my bags down. The restaurant food was good but extremely pricey, I found better food on the street for way less money. All in all I found the place to be expensive and overrated,",463
MBS,2,“overrated. Lacking substance.”,"Stayed there during the F1. City in a stand still. chaos everywhere. Over $700 a night.Check-in took over an hour due to:1). lack of proper queues so people were jumping queues and the staff appeared helpless despite being aware.2). 3 different staff members giving 3 different versions of where the available rooms were. We only wanted 2 twin beds for us and the kids. Finally got there after being offered rooms on floors 48, 15 and 8 all with inappropriate bedding configurations. We did make the booking with the basic request over 6 months ago.3). we also expected to use the on-board check-in service on the airport shuttle bus. It wasn't available.Food. Had the buffet dinner at Rise twice which offered an amazing range of food. The dessert bar was to die for. However, it baffled us how we had to sit at the table until 6 o'clock sharp (not a minute early) until we could start when the kids were starving. The waitress literally looked at her watch at 5:59 and said we HAD to wait another minute. Breakfast at Sky57 was good.Pool. Yes, the icon and pretty cool. Great that access is now limited to only hotel guest. We used the pool mainly at night and it became obvious in the under water light that the water was murky. Got yelled at by the lifeguard for using a floaty for a 3 year-old, apparently not allowed. Later on saw floaties being sold at the shop next to the pool. Concierge appeared confused when approached about a recently opened attraction. They lack basic information about transport options which were readily available on the internet. The hotel seemed very ill equipped to provide assistance to something beyond the Singapore border. One staff started giving personal advice about how he wouldn't go there himself until at least 12 months later and another talked about how their Northern neighbours were not as hard working as the Singaporeans. Not very helpful when we are there only for 4 days and have no intention of returning to Singapore in the near future. The room was big for a hotel and the view of the city was amazing, especially during the F1. However, the velvet chairs, couches and ottomans were stained with various coloured patches and there was a definite unpleasant smell in one of the room corners. Very mindful of what the kids could be lying down on. Paid top dollar for a mediocre and not to standard experience. Definitely NOT 5-stars. MBS need to reflect on the reviews and realise the substance of a hotel and the staff needs to match the hype and advertising. Guests do not need to be made to feel that staff were doing them a favour, expecially the amount they're charging.",97
MBS,3,“Expensive for what it is - but worth a try”,"Overall not too bad, but you're paying for the great views and access to the Infinity pool more than anything. The rooms are pretty standard hotel rooms and nothing special, but were comfortable and well maintained. Check in and check out was efficient, we were also given early access to our room which was great.The pool itself is worth the trip, at least to tick it off your 'to do' list. We had an excellent fternoon with the friendly poolside drinks service and enjoying the views over Singapore. Take your camera and sunscreen up there with you!",590
MBS,3,“3 star hotel at 6 star prices”,"I just got back from a 2 night stay at this hotel. It was my birthday so I wanted to treat myself and I have heard a lot about how fantastic this resort was. I checked in on a Friday at about noon and there were tons of people checking in and out. My check in procedures was quite fast and was given room 1313 of Tower 3. Once I got to the room, I was expecting a luxurious room but unfortunately the room furnishings looked old and dated. My room had a balcony facing the Gardens by the Bay. I notice that the balcony was about three-quarters the size of the room. Personally, I found that a waste of space, they should have made the room bigger and the balcony smaller. There was also no sitting area in the balcony. For the room rates they are charging, they should at least have one lounge chair out on the balcony.As mentioned earlier, the room furnishings looked old and dated, there were also white scuff marks on the TV console and some pen markings on the far right TV console drawers. Also, as I flipped through the complimentary stationery, I noticed the 2 postcards had stuff written on it ( I guessed from the previous guest), so I just threw them in the dustbin. I tried to use the bedside table cordless phone but it seemed to be out of order. Also, the flashlight in the closed was also not working. But no worries, there was still a working phone on the desk and I did not need a flashlight anyway, so I did not bother reporting it to the maintenance department.One of this resort’s main attractions is the sky park and the infinity pool on it. As I stayed on the 13th floor, I had to take the lift to the 34th floor and transfer to the 57th skypark floor. The view from the skypark was breathtaking but that’s about it. The swimming pool is perpetually crowded, even at 9.30 pm! The swimming pool felt like a public swimming pool on a Saturday afternoon. Being such a huge hotel, with three towers of hotel rooms, they should have built a bigger swimming pool. Another attraction of the resort was the shopping mall attached to it. It was really huge! I got lost quite a few times! While I was shopping one morning, I decided to sign up for the Sands Rewards Card but the concierge told me to come back at 1 p.m. as the Sands Rewards Counter only opens at 1 p.m. I found that quite odd, as the shoppes open at about 10.30 a.m., shouldn’t the Sands Rewards Counter also open at about the same time to make it more attractive to shop at the shoppes?I also noticed that after spending billions of dollars to build this resort, the hotel room key card is not the contactless version. Quite often, I and also other hotel guests have to insert their room key card twice in the lift slot before they can get their destination floor button to stay lit.On the day I checked out of the hotel, I tried to view my hotel bill on the room’s TV but after 10 minutes of ‘requesting billing review, please wait…’ nothing happened so I gave up.This hotel is not a bad hotel but its not great either, but after all the hype, billions dollars spent and the room rates they are charging, I was expecting a much better hotel experience.",539
MBS,1,“Five Star Hotel - 1 Star Service”,"I was staying in this hotel from 28-30th Sept. A friend of mine who is a member of Paiza helped me to book, therefore prior arriving i have only a ref number and no idea which tower i was going to check in. Once i have arrived in my cab, someone indeed came to help me with the baggage The guy asked me which tower i was going check-in, i told him could you hang on while i go to the concierge. After i got my check in information, i went back to look for him, but i couldn't find and to my horror my bag was left outside the glass door without anyone attended to it. So i have to get my baggage and pass it to another Since my booking was made by a Paiza member, i was privileged to check in via the VIP lounge, you would thought you might could skipped the long que compared to the normal check in counter, but let me assure you that at the VIP lounge , you will still need to que .. the lounge itself is pathetically small. The room is nothing special, although it's pretty huge and decent but i belived any of the five star hotel could provide similar or better room. The pool itself is very big, spectacular view, very crowded like some kinda water park, with public gawking around, i have even seen an old man sleeping on the sun deck without proper swimming attire.. totally lack of exclusivity and privacy. I got lost my way and confused when i check out. I thought i have to go to VIP lounge again but someone directed me to the tower 1 and when i reached tower 1 another staff directed me to line up with the check in line instead, then i got to know only check out lane was at another side when i overheard the same staff gave the check out direction to a couple. After i was done with my check out procedures, i told the staff i would like my baggage to keep at the concierge. he said.. ok bring it to the opposite side.. i was huh?? what? i have to carry it over by myself?? Overall, i feel paying 400 SGD per night for this hotel is totally not worth it.. lack of privacy, i don't feel warmth staying here, in every lift entrance there is a lady staff stationed whom doesn't even bother to say good morning or even smile at you when you walked pass... The lobby is like some kinda wet market.. lots lots of ppl standing and sitting around. doesnt even have a proper sofa.. oh yeah.. as a hotel guest, be prepared to line up with the public for a long taxi que.. not to mention the traffic at the entrance is a BIG BIG MESS!!! despite some staff were placed to control it.. it 's still a MESS!I wouldn't expect so much if this hotel only cost me 100 per night.. if you can afford such price, please go elsewhere for a better stay experience as you can always go to MBS to enjoy other facilities like casino , shopping mall n etc..",147
MBS,2,“marina bay sands hotel rules changed..urgh”,"i booked for this hotel because i saw some of the reviews here,some are bad and some are good, well its a liftime experience so i told myself why not try to stay for a night, after all i like my daughter to experience the awesome pool they have,so i chose the club room with the city view because of the of the previleges like an access to infinity pool and sky park etc but the most of it was that as some of the review says when you are a hotel guest in MBS you are allowed to invite 4 friends to use the infinity pool but when confirm about it thru phone and made an international call to MBS,they said the rules are changed and now they wont allow any hotel guest to invite friends who are not staying at MBS,i was shocked and disspointed.",62
MBS,3,“Too much hype”,"Ok, the view from the pool is amazing, I have to admit. But other than that, nothing much. The room was normal. Check in area normal. Massive walk between Tower 1 to Tower 3. Very long walk to & from the convention centre (very tiring to hold an event here). This is a normal hotel with a great pool on high floor",429
MBS,3,“Hotel that's Really an Attraction”,"If you are looking for a hotel this is more of an attraction then this is for you. The hotel complex is massive. Includes Mall, Museum, Casino, Gardens..etc. As an attraction you would expect reception to explain the complex upon check in. That didn't happen, no map no nothing. It would have made the stay easier and more enjoyable. We ventured around, but it took several days for us to find everything. The rooms are ok, but request a high floor for better view. We arrived late and were stuck in tower 1 on the 9th floor. We were eye level with the top of the mall. I asked for a higher floor at check in, but we couldn't get one until the next day which wasn't going to be worth moving it as we were only there a few nights. The room really could use upgraded amenities. You expect more from a casino hotel. Speaking of casino no one tells you that you need to show your passport every time you enter the casino. Not only show it, but show it to 3 people. You also must show it to exit. Another item that might be helpful to know.The breakfast buffet at the lobby restaurant was great. Lots of choices. If you don't like crowds then eat somewhere else. We ate here twice, once on a Sunday and once on a Tuesday. The week day was far less crowded, but it's still overall a crowded experience. The food was really good though.You are really paying for the fact that the hotel is an attraction itself. The SkyPark was amazing, far better than the photos. Not much of a crowd on the weekdays we where there. Great poolside service. Again my only gripe was that there are not clear instructions, in this case how to get from our 9th floor tower one room to the tower 2 sky park elevator. We figured it out but some advance instruction would have been great.Upgrade to the club level as that allows you to access the club level restaurant at the skypark. This is another thing that wasn't explained on the website very well. Your club level buffet breakfast and happy hour are at the skypark. Well worth it. I had to search the web site to figure it all out. In all the Hotel is ok, but would be great if they had a brochure with all the info and a few instructions at check in. The skypark was the saving grace, as there is nothing like it in the world!!!",225
MBS,2,“Gotta go for at least 1 night while in Singapore....”,"Huge line to check in... nice pink champagne while we waited.... to early so all details taken, given a ref no. so no hassle when we returned.. headed up to roof top bar to kill an hour AMAZING views, great photo's taken... lovely cocktails... relined up for room key... arrived at room ,not the room we had booked and paid for plus really disgusting marks on the day bed!!!... waited an hour for our new room , got fed up so went out, returned later that evening .... given an up-grade to a beautiful suite, with the most FAB views of the city both from the bathroom and the main sitting/bedroom it was STUNNING.Breakfast was so so busy , got told off by on of the ladies in long dresses for sitting an empty table.!!!! informed her that we waited an nobody was at the entrance .. variety of food was great although cold...then had a waitress roll her eyes at us , when we asked please could we have another cup of coffee and tea, I would of got it myself but tea and coffee are not self service.I think Marina Bay is far to big and busy to add any personal touches by the staff, although on returning to the airport the bagage staff were very friendly and helpful....Think 1 stay is enough.....",105
MBS,3,“Do it once but that's it!”,"Its kind of a must do but I wouldn't do it again. The hotel is designed to take your money and as much as possible as quickly as possible. There is really nothing intimate about this hotel. The foyer could probably get away with being a Hospital - very clinical. The rooms are good but not great for the price. I have stayed at at least 10 hotels in Singapore and the service and rooms have been better at these hotels compare to the Marina Bay Sands. But having said that stay here once for sure. The Infinity pool, the views across Singapore are amazing.",98
MBS,3,“Meh...”,"Having stayed here twice exactly 12 months apart, I was a little disappointed to see how quickly the rooms have started to look a little shabby and unloved in places.Also, whilst extremely busy over the F1 weekend, the service levels were remarkably average - agreements being made and then not delivered on more than one occasion and not just to myself.Yes the hotel has some stunning views, it is a very impressive building etc and generally the quality is resaonably high. However, the price is also very representitive of this and quite frankly, value for money? Highly questionable....",41
MBS,3,“Good enough!”,"This place is nice considering the SKYPARK but then again the reception is so slow but good thing they have an express check-out! Room is ok & clean and spacious. Breakfast is just ordinary nothing so fantastic but has choices, yes.",356
MBS,2,"“Plenty of \Wow Factor\"" but little else.”""","I booked via their website and their confirmation came back with a figure much higher than that quoted. I pointed this out and it was rectified swiftly. On check in we waited in line for 20 minutes only to be told that check in was at 3pm so please come back then. This was at around 12:30pm. When I queried whether the hundreds of rooms subject to changeover that day magically became available at 3pm the lady suggested 2pm as a compromise - very poor service for a five star hotel. The room was large and very comfortable with a tremendous view over the city and the \sky park\"" was, as expected, something quite special.I opted for the express checkout as I didn't want to be subjected to a similar wait to that encountered at check in. I was assured an invoice would be emailed to me to confirm the final bill. I knew,however, how much this should be as we hadn't charged any extras to the room. A week and a half later no invoice had been received but my credit card showed an amount considerably higher than it should have been - what a surprise! Once agin this was swiftly attended to when I raised the issue by email. The extra charges were for items from the mini bar. As soon as I explained that we hadn't used the mini bar, there was an apology and agreement to credit my card immediately. I would, therefore, suggest anyone using this hotel checks their paperwork carefully! I noticed another guest having similar problems whilst checking out.This truly is a spectacular building and, probably, one of the most unique hotels in the world. However, once the wow factor wears off, one notices a cold rather unwelcoming atmosphere and ones arrival at the main entrance usually remains unacknowledged, unlike in other 5 star hotels in the region. Furthermore, a customer satisfaction survey completed over a week ago, and reflecting the views set out here has resulted in no feedback from the hotel.When the novelty wears off, occupancy rates will fall dramatically if the service levels are not addressed.""",214
MBS,1,“Not worth it”,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights as part of a conference he was attending. We decided to splash out and stay in one of their suite rooms and couldn't believe what a let down it was! It took well over 45 mins to 'check in' at which point we were told we couldn't check in yet and had to ask whether we could get lift passes to go to the sky park to wait for the room to get ready. When we eventually managed to get into our room they had lost our luggage and we had to wait another 40 minutes for my bag to be found. There was absolutely no service to indicate that we were staying in a suite room. The majority of service staff were actually rude, this was the first time I have experienced this in Singapore. Despite this we were charged 80 dollars a day for 'service'! No idea what this involved. When we checked out there were serveral mistakes on our bill and the check out process took an hour. Completely inefficient, felt more like a budget hotel than 5 star. I certainly wouldn't recommend the Marina Bay Sands when there are so many other wonderful hotels in Singapore to choose from.",249
MBS,3,"“Been There, Done That, Not Sure to Come Back”","OK, stayed here for two nights during our 5-day holiday in Singapore. We booked the Club Room.Nothing very special to write. Of course ,the WOW factors are the hotel building itself (the tall, three-tower megastructure), the skypool (swimming pool) upstairs and the surrounding view from the top. Other than that, nothing special.Our room is nice, but won't call it a spectacular 5-star luxury. We mentioned about birthday, so they delivered a cake to our room. Nice touch, hence the extra 0.5 point on the service level (otherwise, we think it was only worth 3.5 points as we had questioned prior to our stay but the way the replies were responded were concerning). Check-in was not that long as we used the VIP lounge (being book in the Club room). Check-out was quick too.Nothing is cheap in the area (most restaurants in the mall area are fine dining; the cheapest dining option would be the food court), and we had the feeling that everyone there wanted to \squeeze\"" the most out of you (a beer at the pool costed us SGD 14).The room cleaning was not done until very late (we came back at 2.30pm, and our room was still not done yet!)We briefly checked out the casino. It looks smaller, even compared to the Star (Sydney) or Crown Casino (Melbourne). The worst part....smoking is allowed on the most gaming floors.To us, this was a good experience, but a once-off only. We ticked Marina Bay Sands on our (bucket) list!""",115
MBS,2,“Impossible to check in or out!”,"I was not impressed at all. For the price we paid I expected more. It was so expensive, and the time it took to get through the queue to check in or out was a joke.Then when we finally got through the queues and headed up to the famous pool it was so over crowded that you couldnt even enjoy it. We didnt spend long up there needless to say. The breakfast was awful. The pastries were stale and the food was not very fresh in general.The rooms were nice and large, they had a good size verandah area. The facilities were nice inside the rooms and everything in the room was of great quality.",434
MBS,3,"“For steep price, missing value added”","Marina Bay Sands is a 5 star hotel generally at $400+SGD a night. It banks way too much on the infinity pool on its roof with restaurants and bars, cumulatively known as the Skypark. While the views from the top and our room (awesome view of the Gardens by the Bay - very romantic by day and night) showcase the best of Singapore, it is not any different from other views from the city. In fact, my own view from City Hall could even be considered better since it includes MBS in it. And the pool, while lovely... is still only a pool. I did enjoy the adults only section of the pool though which was much more serene without having kids jumping in and running around. I still haven't fully decided whether it was worth splurging so much just to get access to the pool versus seeing the same view for free at Ku De Ta, but I guess it did feel nice to have that exclusive privilege while the others gawked from outside the security checkpoints.Anyways, the point is that the service and added touches are substandard at MBS compared to other 5 star hotels. Heck, it even impresses me less than some 3 star hotels. Sure, it does have the complimentary water and wifi, an impressive bathroom, and a nice flatscreen TV. But why does breakfast cost an arm and a leg when we're already shelling out so much? It's not like they're greeting you with fruit or cookies or anything (which is a nice touch in many other hotels in Southeast Asia). Besides, you can't put anything in the fridge if you want to cool your own drinks or food since moving anything receives an automatic charge. At least leave us some space. Checkin doesn't start til 3PM and checkout is an early 11AM (noon if you do express checkout or used your credit card to checkin for TV checkout). Maybe you can wiggle around this a bit but it's much later/earlier than the norm. We were told we received a complimentary upgrade and indeed the room is spacious and nice, appearing large enough to hold a small group of people even.If you can get a room for $250 or less (or better yet, get your company to pay for it), do it! It is worth it and allocate all your time to hanging out at the Skypark for the day and night. That's what you paid for, isn't it? But if you end up spending more, just realize that it's for the Skypark/views and don't expect too much else.",359
MBS,2,“Great pool but overall disappointing stay”,"Our trip to the Marina Bay Sands (\MBS\"") was supposed to be the highlight of our trip to Singapore with the unique feature being the infinity pool looking over the Singapore skyline. This part of the hotel did not disappoint and the view was indeed fantastic, although the pool and jacuzzis nearby do get quite full at times.However where MBS does fall down in is the lack of staff and the attitude of the staff at MBS. Things do not start well when there are only 2/3 check in staff and really long queues. Also check in is not permitted before a certain time and check out is really early compared to other 5* establishments (11am) with draconian regulations to enforce against over-stayers. Given the time restrictions, queues at check out are even worse than check-in, use the express check out if possible.We were supposed to have an upgrade to the next category of room up as part of an Amex inbound offer but the room we received was in Tower 3, 10th floor with a lot of traffic noise so I'm not sure we actually received our upgrade. Given the length of the queues still at reception we thought it better to lump it and enjoy ourselves instead.Staff tend to be curt and do not reply to you in a manner which makes you think that they want to help you. Rooms are well appointed but not the best compared to other 5* hotels that I have stayed and in comparison, the overall value of MBS is not good. The lifts are pathetic as access to certain floors is restricted by keycard but the readers are difficult to use due to the minuscule size of the entry slots and often floors are missed or the lift stays still for minutes as everyone fumbles around.It felt to us that the whole MBS offering was not to ensure that you had a nice stay but rather that you were being permitted to stay and in order to justify your residency you had to pay for all manner of irritating small things. We will be staying in Wanderlust next time instead.""",172
MBS,3,“First class hotel missing alot”,This was our first trip to Singapore and decided to go a little upmarket with our hotel choice. We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands. The accommodation was lovely and we had an amazing view from our room on the 48th Floor in tower 1. The few things that let the hotel down was the price of food and beverages. Alcohol in the hotel was so overpriced it was actually off putting e.g a bottle of bombay saphire was $250SGP thats the equivalent to 130GBP. The lobby looked very impersonal and the reception area was totally chaotic. There is no queue system people push in front of each other. The check in and check out process themselves take far to long to action and the shopping mall attached to the hotel was top brand stores with nothing for usual people. Im an XL not an XXXXXXXXXL it shouldnt be that hard to shop. The skypark area was excellent and very comfortable. The treatments we had at the Banyan Tree Spa were fantastic.,125
MBS,2,“Not worth the cost”,"Where do I begin! The hotel is iconic and yes it does have a pool on its roof however the price you pay for a room is not worth it at all.There are three towers which are difficult to navigate between and they are divided between first to third class.Rooms are very basic with square dark wood bulky furniture and the tv channels are limited and the carpets were stained.Room service menu is also very basic and given that we paid $500 for a night (albeit the cheapest room at the time), however I did expect a little bit more than a 'holiday inn' experience.Also the holding deposit took about a month to be removed from my credit card despite contacting the hotel about this.",197
MBS,2,“Not worth it”,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands resort for one night on our way to Malaysia. Unfortunately our stay did not meet expectations. We got upgraded to a \suite\"" that was overlooking a 4 lane highway. We couldn't even sit on the terrace because of the noise of the cars. The air conditioning in our room did not work and was on a constant 19 degrees. We were going to meet friends for a drink in Ku De Ta bar that is part of the hotel. My partner was turned away because he was wearing sandals (sandals that were only showing 1 cm of skin on the front of his feet), otherwise he was wearing a long sleeved collared shirt and long trousers. The bar was empty and it was a Thursday night, so I was very surprised we could not meet our friends there for one drink. The staff at Ku De Ta were extremely rude and cocky. Not the kind of service I was expecting as a hotel guest. I have stayed in many better hotels in Singapore and would not stay here again. It was overpriced for the service and treatment that we got.""",152
MBS,2,“Terrible value for money”,"All depends upon how you feel about modern mall/airport designed hotels. For me it is too impersonal and big. The rooms are very expensive, but quite small, done in the rather nasty modern, but 1960's feel veneer. I could stay in the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, or the Mulia hotel in Jakarta for much less, and have a much better hotel experience than the MBS. If you want a crowded shopping mall experience then the MBS is the place for you. I am here on conference rates, and I assumed the 350 dollar a night room at least included breakfast, but not that an extra 44 dollars. I am used to staying at good hotels often during the year. I am outraged at how expensive this hotel is and how little it offers. I would not recommend staying here. Overrated, overpriced, and I resent that my company will pay for this place.",453
MBS,3,“Snail pace check-in process”,"Stepping into the lobby of Marina Bay Sands is one awesome moment for many, but for those who already been there, they knew that moment is shortlived. Don't get me wrong. The hotel is indeed a luxury, big lobby, elegant decor, fantantic location and great views. But being in the middle of all of it, the feel is too impersonal and too crowded. It's like being in a shopping mall or an airport, with people all around, queueing, waiting, walking. You won't be able to tell who are the hotel guests and who are not. There is no peaceful ambiance, only noisy, chaotic buzz.The check-in process seems to take forever. There is no clear instructions/signage where to queue up for check-in and no staff is helping as well (or maybe there's a lot of guests for the staff to handle). Finally got the room key at 4pm. We got a room upgrade (room located in 2F/Tower 1 - Garden by the Bay view) as we were told that deluxe rooms are no longer available. Ok, the room is WOW! It's huge, got a nice bathtub, a separate bath and walk-in shower room, a powder room (just another bathroom minus the bathtub), 2 large LCD TVs, a comfy sofa and a king size bed. It has a floor-to-ceiling glass wall which opens up to a large private balcony. The view of the highway below is blocked by plants but the traffic noise can be heard quite loud. (Suggestion: Book for rooms in higher floor for better view). Wifi is free. And then, there is the mini-bar. It has pressure sensor. So say you are putting something in it and want to take out and clear the space for yours to fit in, well, anything you take out will automatically be charged, I guess. We never tried as the prices are way too expensive for a canned soda. Must try is the infamous Infinity Pool. It has the best views. We also went to Harry Potter exhibit in the Art Science Museum.The check-out is 11am, a bit too early considering the slow pace check-in process we had. But checking out is much easier. The counter staff told us that they will just bill the credit card we used for checking in. (Make sure you confirm your room charges, though to avoid inconveniences later).We are out in 5 mins.Overall, it is a good stay (not sure if I can say the same if we stayed in the deluxe room, though) but it is also too expensive. One day should be enough just to experience the hype that is Marina Bay. In my opinion, it's more apt to call it a tourist destination rather than a hotel.",374
MBS,3,“Everything is relative”,"A lot has been written about Marina Bay Sands (MBS) hotel. Here is my take from a slightly different angle:1. Great Location - it is connected to the MBS mall where you can spend 2 full days as it is humongous. It has an MRT station underground (Bayfront) which can take you all over the island. 2. The room - decent sized room and bathroom. However, it is without character. A very bland, 5-star hotel room. If you've been to the Venetian and Palazzo in Vegas or even the Venetian in Macau, MBS does not have the same level of ornateness. What I did notice though, is quite good soundproofing. I didn't hear sounds from the adjacent rooms, neither from the corridor. Bed and pillows and sheets are quite comfortable. Internet access was complimentary in the room.3. Lobby and check-in - The lobby is quite narrow for a hotel with 3 towers. You literally have to avoid people coming the opposite direction most times. Check-in and Check-out is like a zoo, especially during the designated times. What can you expect from a hotel with 2,500 rooms anyway? They also promised check-in aboard the airport shuttle- while there was free wifi onboard, there was no instruction on how to check-in onboard and avoid the long lines.4. Systems are not real-time - We checked out at 11am, and was still recorded in their system by 12 noon as checked-in. This probably explains why there is such a big gap between check-in (3pm) and checkout times (11am). Their system probably takes a while to inform housekeeping to make up the room for the next guest. Same with the Sands Rewards program. It takes a while for the system to be updated, unlike their Las Vegas cousins.5. Which brings me to the title of my review... It is a pretty good hotel actually, but not for SGD500++. They offered a discounted rate through the Sands Rewards card, and even at almost 50% off, it pales in comparison to the Shangri-la, Conrad or the Ritz-Carlton, all of which I can stay at cheaper or equal to the \discounted\"" MBS rate. Therein lies the rub. For the same price, I will stay at those 3 properties and not at MBS.""",141
MBS,3,"“impressive, but...”","We stayed at the hotelfor one night. We booked one suite with access to \the Club\"". The room was very good. Cheked in in a private area, very efficient, but no one to helped us with luggage! We had 2 big suitcases and we had to carry them by ourselfs! We asked an extrabed at the time we made the reservation and at the time we arrived it was'nt there. Asked for it at 10pm, 11pm and finnaly at mid-night someone showed up and asked me wath I want. 30m later the opened the sofa!The dinks and fingerfood at the club was very good, breakfast very poor. This hotel is once in a lifetime. Don't repeat. Spend a night, go to the pool enjoy it in the midle of dozens, and if you want a real hotel go to \""Mandarin Oriental\"".""",167
MBS,3,“it could be beter”,"After having stayed in the mariott a few time it was finally time to check out the marina bay. but to bad it did not come close to give me the great feeling like in the mariott.When talking to the taxi drivers you get the answer why: most of the people that should be working in this hotel were to be from Singapore but nothing is farther from the truth. The most are Malaysians or Chinese and with that come other ways of treating people.That's not the only thing, unlike mariott here the towels, beds, soap, shampoo, conditioners ... are just not at the level they should be for the money you pay for the room.And eating breakfast here although it's good food it so busy in the lobby area it looks and feels like your eating at a marketplace. The light and fireworks at 20:00 are great, the mall is great and to sky terrace has a great few but that doesn't make the room better.",362
MBS,3,“Las Vegas in Singapore”,"My in-laws treated my husband, my baby and I to 3 nights at this huge hotel. The GOOD : HUUUGGGEEE room (we stayed in an Orchid Suite) overlooking Singapore City so you can image the beautiful view. The bathroom was also big enough to throw a party in. The breakfast buffet at the ground floor restaurant Rise was the best location as it was the most complete buffet compared to the other restaurants. The location was great as it was adjacent to the mall - where my son loved going up and down the elevators and escalators. The sunset views from the skypark were lovely and breathtaking. The NOT-SO-GOOD: They DIDNT HAVE ANY amenities for my baby (this is the first even in all the hotels I have travelled around the world to not provide shampoo and soap for babies. To think this is suppose to be a family friendly hotel. So we were hassled to get him some body wash at the nearby mall. They had NO baby pillows for the crib. ??? so my baby was so uncomfortable sleeping. The pool was overcrowded with people -- looked like a scene from the pool at the Hard Rock Cafe hotel and the Encore hotel in Las Vegas during spring break. To get to the otherside of the skypark you needed your key at all times or else you wouldnt be able to go through. We had a very bad experience with a waitress in the lounge as she first gave us the wrong champagne and told us that was what we ordered when it was not. When we asked for 3 glasses she said she could only give us 2 --while she generously gave 3 glasses to the table of two beside us.. Luckily enough after we complained to the restaurant manager she made up for it. Thought we did tell her that they really need to up their customer service most especially with room service. All in all - if your goal is to party then this is the place to stay. If you want a more private, personalized romantic trip or are with your family this definitely is not.",340
MBS,3,“Satisfactory stay”,"I had checked into a Premier Room at MBS with a visiting friend from Japan. For me, it was a weekend 'Staycation'. For my Japanese friend, it was a holiday. We both enjoyed our stay thoroughly. There were some perks and bummers with this hotel thought.Some perks that made our stay pleasant:1. The room is worth of it 5-star status. It's clean, comfortable, spacious, and our room came with a very big bath room that fits a huge bath tub, a separate shower room and a toilet. 2. The hotel was next to a brand new shopping belt (Marina Bay Sands Shoppes). There are a number of good restaurants there to check out.3. We had a beautiful room view facing the cityscape. 4. Excellent furnishings in the room. Beds are plush and comfortable. The room came with a mini-bar, boosting a great selection of excellent teas from TWG. 5. 2 train stations (Bayfront Station and Marina Bay Station) are nearby and easily accessible. It made our trips to the city convenient. Some bummers:1. The hotel is too big for its own good. The lobby and the concierge gets over-crowded with guests, waiting to be served. It is unfortunate because it got too noisy and overbearing. Very unbefitting for a world class 5-star hotel image. You don't feel like you are staying in an exclusive 5-star hotel.2. The sky pool on level 57 was sardine-packed on the weekends! I could be standing at any spot of the pool, but there were people surrounding me less than an arm's length away. I could only waddle and not swim in the pool. Thought the skypool boosted an exclusive scenic view, our holiday spirit was quickly dampened by the overcrowds. 3. The driveway to the hotel entrance was small. Thus, traffic congestion was constant. It gets chaotic when you are trying to get a cab because the crowd is is just overwhelming. In short, it was a good hotel to stay in with great hospitality. It is just too big and too crowded everywhere.",103
MBS,1,“Nice hotel but avoid”,"We booked a premium room using the Amex offer, and were supposed to receive an upgraded room (front desk just ignored this) and we were forced to stay in the premium room, shouldn't this upgrade be automatic?We booked this hotel for the pool, but it is way too busy for us to even enjoy, it looks like they are letting in visitors. The pool should only be for hotel guests, if this inst the case people will start avoiding.We won't be returning and I suggest you avoid, the pool is the draw card, but with so many random visitors its not worth it.",68
MBS,1,“Pure Mess”,I like Singapore and I like their 5 Star hotels as I find the service in general very good. The Sands however is a pure mess and makes you wonder wether you are dealing with a british budget airline as opposed to a 5 start hotel. The overall experience was so bad that I do not even want to waste my time on a long review. Never again!,146
MBS,3,“a victim of its own success”,"you know the picture of the infinity pool with just a couple of people in it...well imagine ALL the sunbeds taken (mostly by towels) and being unable to do much swimming because of hundreds of people in the pool all taking photos of themselves and \the Edge\"". you've got it ! Decided to have tea and coffee our first morning whilst getting ready...only to find none of those fiddly pasteurised pots of milk....just coffeemate....English Breakfast and coffeemate..i don't think so. apparently you have to ring room service for milk !! Think of a busy train concourse in a capital city, and that's the reception/lobby/foyer all day over. architects dream, engineering feat and bloody expensive....next time back to Royal Plaza on Scotts for us, where the concierge can answer your questions directly and instantly without having to google everything - and only get half the info !""",95
MBS,3,“Not worth the money”,"Hotel is far too big and crowded. Rooms are no more than a standard hotel room. We booked months in advance and our room was not what we booked, and also mirror and windows covered in hand prints (although this was fixed when we requested a clean of the room). View of Singapore is amazing and it was great having a kid free pool area. The infinity pool was beautiful. Staff friendly but not enough staff to handle the amount of guests. Overpriced for what it is. Glad we stayed but probably wouldn't stay again.",177
MBS,2,"“Basically, an expensive \ticket\"" for an amazing swimming pool”""","After paying 500 euros for a room per day you expect a personal attention and then you find yourself queueing for an hour! to check in, .... breakfast was the same ... The hotel is massive but it seems that they do not have enough staff to provide a good service for the guests. The lack of recetionists was appaling for a supposed luxury hotel and the hotel seems to be itself a tourist attraction so the lobby is like a shopping mall arcade full of people taking photos ( there is actually a shopping mall in the ground floor, as well as a dodgy casino ... ).Basically, the hotel is its swimming pool. You pay for that. An incredibly beautiful infinity pool overlooking the Singapore Marina. It is overwhelmed anyway ( and now tourists no longer can get in, imagine when they could ... ) but it is and awesome and impressive construction.Next time I will try again the Pan Pacific or the Mandarin, where you get a real unique high end experience in all senses.",337
MBS,1,“Rude Staff at Marina Bay Sands”,"As a traveller, I had never complain against a staff nor a hotel but my experience with the rudeness and race discrimination of one of your staff is deplorable.His name tag spells the name Chris, a Chinese who worked at tower 2, 55 floor checking the roomcards of guests at 3.30-4.00pm on 1 September 2012. He was wearing a red t-shirt and is approximately 1.8m tall and spoke w a chinese accent.I arrived on the 55th floor with my parents and my son to visit the skypark. Before me were three Chinese PRC who brought only 1 guest pass but was allowed to go through. When it came to our turn, he denied us entry. He told us about the policy at the lobby and I can understand and respect the policy if it applies equally across the board. But when I asked him why he allowed the three chinese PRC guest to pass, his reply was,\ I only answer to my boss and I need not explain to you\"". In my 15 years of travelling and staying in hotel locally and aboard, I have never experience such rudeness. This was my first hotel stay to celebrate the birthday of four family members in the month of September and it that experience really ruined it for us.My whole experience at your hotel has been disappointing. From the moment of check-in to present, there has been just too many hick-ups for such a hotel of this caliber. I have stayed at the Palazzo Hotel in Vegas and the service was thoroughly professional and the staff actually tries to help you. I thought it would be the same at the Sands in Singapore.1) I was not given the room that I had reserved2) Excessive long wait just to change the room ( 2hours of waiting..never experience a waiting time this long when you expect guest to chick out by 11am)3) And the icing on the cake; my experience with your staff ChrisI am dreading my next 2 days here.""",429
MBS,3,"“Amazing building, but as a hotel it's just too big...”","This is one big and busy hotel... to be honest, way too busy for me. Check in was reasonably quick and the room was ready, so no waiting. With three towers, sometimes there's a bit of backtracking to get to the right elevator. And even after check in, it's sometimes confusing about which elevator will get you to the pool, gym etc.I'll start with what i enjoyed...the room. We stayed in an Orchid suite with great views over the Singapore skyline. I can't fault the room - everything worked, it was big, had a comfortable bed, easy to use gadgets, good bathroom (but some no-name toiletries) etc. A handy hint - if you get a suite you can have breakfast at Sky on 57 which is quieter and nicer that the general club area on 57 (it's also a nice place to have a drink on the terrace - you don't need to have dinner there either). The other great thing was the gym - massive, great equipment, nice staff, amazing views as you're on the cardio equipment - top marks.On the flip side. The pool is of course stunning, but it was always crowded and i found the security staff \inconsistent\"" about the rule of do you need to show a room card for every person going through the gate, or can you have just one for the two (or more) of you. Sometimes they could be a bit abrupt. The shopping centre was ok - but found the mix of stores rather strange. If you want to shop, head to Orchard Rd. What i did like was the Andy Warhol exhibition at the ArtScience museum nearby (the lotus flower building) and the Harry Potter exhibit which was interesting.Had a drink at KuDeTa which was a real disappointment compared to KDT in Bali in the early years. I expected it to be expensive, but there was no real atmosphere, the attention was on the table guests buying bottles and i noticed lots of \""ladies looking for companionship\""...which is fine but it was just a weird scene. We didn't try any of the restaurants, but did try room service - which was all ok and efficient service. Also, didn't get to the casino so no feedback on that.I think it's ok to stay once (for us, as a stop over on the way back from europe) but i can't say i would recommend it to friends. It's an amazing building, and the staff really do try very hard to personalise the experience...but i think it's back to the Ritz-Carlton.""",229
MBS,3,“Bad managememt”,"Booked a standard suite on the 26th of August and was told that we were only able to check in after 3. Totally fine by me. But when we got there, we were told that the rooms were ready and they will call us at 3.30pm to let us know the details of the room. By 4pm I didn't hear back, I went to the concierge to inquire about my room. I was served by Jenny at tower 3 and I was again told it wasn't ready yet and I have to wait until 5pm at least. Really? Checking in at 5pm? Which hotel does that? It's just bad management and horrible customer service. And by the way, MBS wasn't my first choice, but my family wanted to experience MBS and so I obliged. This isn't the first time I've encountered bad service with MBS. I always advised my guests and friends to stay away from here.Jenny was very patient, even though I flared up and shouted at her in the lobby. She kept apologizing and I have to say that she did her best to get me my room and in the end I was upgraded to the Presidential suite.MBS has great staff that are attentive, but the management is just plain horrible, it seriously need an overhaul and improvement. Will I go back to MBS again? NEVER.",80
MBS,3,“OK hotel but not coming back ever”,"I was so excited to try this hotel and then it turned out to be a disaster , the rooms are really average , they cost ALOT for what they're worth and the staff are not friendly at all .The pool has a nice view but it was not cleaned , i was scared to catch some deseases from it . Anyway , try it once , not coming back again ,ever . This hotel is way too over-rated !",61
MBS,3,“Overated and too crowded..”,"Famous for its pool on the 57th floor, hence the pool itself was too small and cramped! The superior king room was not as I expected. It was quite small. Thus they provide good quality TWG teas (the few only positive things, in my opinion). With a 50% off from the rate, I still feels this hotel is a bit overated.",578
MBS,3,“Not The Best Hotel in Singapore”,"Sands hotels (Macau Venetian and Las Vegas Palazzo) always impress me and they are my family's prefer hotels when we are in Macau and Las Vegas. But Marina Bay Sands (MBS) was a disappointment. I take my mother there for entertainment and gaming, so my family stayed there on four occasions, and we stayed at least four nights on each visit. The MBS has still a long way to go to fine tune its services and efficiency. The most guests arrive through the main entrance located on the Tower One (there is another entrance on the Tower Three side). Compare to its gigantic structures, the drive way to the hotel and entrance are way too small, thus creating chaos on weekends. The entrance is always crowded with tourists and check-in/out hotel guests. More than one occasion, we had to carry our own luggages (we also carried stroller at the time) and open our own door although there were bell-boys around. On weekends, check-in would take forever due to overcrowded guests and understaffed receptionists. The check-in area does not look anything like a 5-star hotel. Wall decorations are minimal and very plain. It just looks like a big convention hotel instead of luxury casino resort. If you book a room through its website and make any requests, most likely you won't get them. For instance, I requested for two queens, but my request was never received. Fine. If you plan to stay there for the first time, ONLY STAY AT THE TOWER ONE!!!. Rooms at the Tower Three do not have BATHTUBS. Only a shower. I believe the Tower One rooms cost a bit more, but it is worth it. If you have no choice but to stay at the Tower Three, then you must instruct your cab driver to drop you off at the Tower Three; otherwise, you have to walk a quiet a long distance (especially if you are traveling with elders and kids). It is a huge hotel (Las Vegas-style); therefore, its service is a bit slow if you have to request from housekeeping or room-service. Give yourself a plenty of time to check-out as well.We stayed different types of rooms at the MBS. Suite is roomy and has Nescafe coffee maker, printer/fax, balcony and of course lovely view. Standard room is just so standard. It is nothing like Grand Hyatt or Four Seasons although its room rate is more. its restaurants are much better. Try lunch at the Jin Shan and also various casual eateries located at the Canal Shoppe. Our favorite was its food court. They offer Chinese, Korean, Western, Malay/Singaporean, Japanese and so on. It is right next to the ice rink. The SkyPark pool was ok. Nothing special other than the fact that it overlooks the marina and situated on the roof. The kids' pool was just too small and always crowded with toddlers as well as their caretakers. If you don't have to stay at this hotel then try to avoid it at all. If you are just planning to stay here because of its popularity and status quo, believe me you won't miss much. Even if you are there gamble, you could stay better hotels nearby. Nearby excellent hotels; Fullerton Bay, InterContinental (at Bugis Junction), Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental etc. Their room rates are bargains compare to ridiculous prices at the MBS. If stay at the MBS, try to catch a show at its theatre but you must book early.",408
MBS,1,“Infestated with Pests!!!”,"Stayed three nights with family in two Premier rooms with City Views (ie. facing the bay). Chose it because my mom likes it when she heard it's relatively new. No doubt the architecture looks amazing. The view of the Marina Bay was spectacular morning or night. But hygiene and customer service were absolutely terrible. Front desk was unfriendly. She gave me the look when she couldn't find my prepayment record on her computer, as if it was MY fault! Then she gave me two rooms at the two opposite ends of the hallway...The room was spacious and airy, great natural light. We kept the curtain opened the whole time so we could enjoy the view. The bathroom was also spacious, but wifi wouldn't work in the separate toilet cubicle in the far corner. The pool was an experience. The Chinese restaurant served great dim sum we went twice. Air-con was adequate throughout the hotel. There were four of us so we took taxis the whole time we were in the city. Taxi rank is right downstairs (we were in Tower 1). Also took their coach to and from the airport. This key card is a bit difficult for the elderlys to insert into the elevator slot before you could press the button for your floor. Here comes the most disgusted part. On the first night of our stay, we came across a cockroach wondering on the tv cabinet. It made us all screamed and yelled. But we didn't call the hotel staff bacause we didn't want to make a big fuss about it or to sound like we wanted freebies. With great effort, we managed to capture the pest and flush it down the toilet ourselves. We did take pictures and video of it. I know it's a tropical country and some insects should be expected. But I swear it was not a friendly insect you find in nature. It was a COCKROACH, a PEST! That should not be seen in a five-star hotel! And you know the worst part? I told my mom about it the next day, and she said she also found one in the bathroom in her room! So beware, this hotel is infestated with pests!!When I returned home, they sent an email asking for feedback. I completed the questionnaire, along with the details of the pest incident. But I have not heard from anyone from the hotel since! End of story I guess!",68
MBS,2,“Extremely disappointed with the MBS in Singapore”,This hotel is all about the pool but does not deliver on anything else! Check in was slow and unfriendly. It was impossible to get a meal after 9pm other than in-room dining; the toilet backed up then maintenance didn't show for ages on top of which the cleaner didnt clean up the mess! The bathroom was still dirty from previous guest. Do not bother with this hotel.,145
MBS,3,“Nothing great except for the pool & sky park”,"We wanted to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for 5 nights but only managed to get 2 nights due to heavy bookings....and we thank god for that!! I went in with a lot of expectations of the hotel and they fell quite short of it. The pool & sky park are definitely amazing and worth a visit. The service in the hotel was terrible. The staff were not accommodating at all even though we had a 7 month old baby with us. Any sort of room service or concierge service took over 30-45 mins to be completed. The rooms had a good city view but were very basic. For a 5 star hotel, I expected more. Breakfast was good & had a lot of variety. I only recommend going for the pool or sky park but other than that it isnt all that great.",132
MBS,3,"“Superb view, but remainder underwhelming”","We stayed here in June 2012in a city view room. The view from the room was spectacular, particularly at night. However the service was poor considering the exorbitant rate. Nothing great about the room. The sky park felt dirty and was loud. Not a place to relax and there needs to be more control on the access for general public to allow guest paying the high rate for use of the facilities to relax. Service staff were not helpful, we got sent to 2 different locations to exchange money and checkin was a slow process with no order. The shoppes were great and are well worth a day trip. For the price you are better off spending your money to stay somewhere else in Singapore and saving your cash for the shopping!",41
MBS,3,“Love the view but not the service”,"Excellent view from the room and also, the infinity pool. It's really nice to be in the pool when the sun is setting - the view is spectacular. But I would definitely go back to a SPG hotel for the service.",169

MBS,3,“Overpriced and underwhelming...”,"Completely inconsistent and confused hotel - each division of the hotel does not seem to communicate with the other (reception, bellboys, concierges etc) so it's almost like they're separate divisions of the business. When we arrived on the airport transfer bus, we were told by the bellboys to leave our bags with them and go check in. Then we went to reception (waaaay at the other side of the complex) and eventually checked in as the reception staff were very slow, and were told we had to go back and get our own bags as they had nothing to do with the arrival bellboys. Similar experience when we checked out - had to make our own arrangements to get our bags down to the transfer bus.Room was good size, rooftop pool area was nice but always crowded, but overall feel of the hotel was that it was accommodation attached onto a massive shopping complex full of premium brands. Breakfast food & service were both awesome though.In summary, the hype of the hotel doesn't meet reality in our opinion, won't be staying there again.",51
MBS,3,“Good points and bad”,"Baggage handling, rooms and views were good but that is all. Check-in was too slow (15 mins wait) despite not long queues. Not enough staff on reception. Public areas, especially the Skypark, we're too crowded and noisy for our taste. Restaurants are not good value for money. We won't be back.",139
MBS,3,“Disappointing experience”,"We stayed at the MBS on the way back from Thailand, and to be honest it was a little disappointing. We tried to check in at 2pm to be told that nothing was available as check in was 3pm. We went up to roof top pool which was great and the real feature whilst we waited. The hotel to me though lacks presence. It lacks a personal touch. It feels like a mega mall that people stay in. I have stayed in Vegas and it is different. Our room was nice the restaurant we went to was great, but left feeling that the price we paid didn't provide the experience we were looking for. I often felt like we were sheep being herded around the hotel... please move over here sir, you need that line sir not this one...",302
MBS,3,“Great facilities but lacks personal touch”,"After emailing the hotel 3 times to confirm the Limo pick up I wasn't surprised to discover that there was no limo to collect us when we arrived. Not a great first impression. When we arrived no concierge opened the doors as the place is so vast. We stood queing in the general line only to discover we actually didn't need to as we had booked a suite, eventually we were informed and went to the VIP check in. I reported the no show limo, the staff apologized but didn't seem surprised.....I had also requested a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake for the room as it was my husbands 40th. Nothing.The suite was OK. Very spacious but already showing signs of wear and tear. The in room dinning book had been scribbled on every page so you couldn't read the menu. The headboard was stained and the fixtures and fittings were not of the highest standards. Unbelievable to see that no milk or creamer or even tea bags were provided in the room, only Nespresso pods. The fridges use the same method as the Las Vegas hotels which use a pressure pad under each item so the slightest movement means your charged instantly. The fridge was crammed so no room for anything you might need to refridgerate. The restaurants were amazing, Cut and db Bistro did not disappoint. But the place to eat was Din Tai Fung.Kuda Ta was OK but in no way anything as good as the original in Bali.Casino was packed but fun, sadly they do not follow the LV principle of providing free alcoholic drinks only soft.It's clear that the size of the hotel impedes their ability to offer any type of personal service, if that isn't a concern then give MBS a go.......we won't return.",112
MBS,3,"“Average rooms and service, only looks good for photos!”","Decided to check out the rooms with some friends, but only to find that the room and service is fairly mediocre. The hype of Skypark and the Infinity pool is truly overrated. The area of Skypark is small, and the pool is actually not conducive for swimming, but more suitable for photo-taking. With the huge crowds, it actually felt like I was visiting a public pool. Do book way in advance if you want to eat at any of the restaurants at the top floor. On a Saturday, there was only spots available at 10:30pm. The only saving grace of the hotel was the great view of the Gardens of the Bay.",244
MBS,3,“Luxurious amenities with average service”,"Marina Bay Sands is, obviously, a luxurious hotel, with the famous SkyPark and casino, so I had really high expectations of the hotel. And of course, given the price I've paid, other than the amenities that I am entitled to use, I would expect great service from their staff. The hotel, overall, has wonderful facilities but they need to improve on their staff quality.The check-in process took too long for a hotel such as Marina Bay Sands. And they do not accept NETS and debit cards, only cash or credit cards, so we had to find an ATM and withdraw cash, queue again and repeat the entire check-in process. They should have indicated that they do not accept debit cards and NETS during the booking. We had 2 keys (instead of 3 like I've read in a previous review), which was quite troublesome since we need one card per person to gain access to the Sky Park and Infinity Pool. Our room was in tower 3 facing Gardens by the Bay and has an excellent view of the garden. The room was very clean and comfortable. The Sky Park and Infinity Pool was fantastic but the restaurants there are super expensive, which, should be expected. There are 2 lifts in each tower, one which services level 1 to 34, and another one from 34 to 57.Overall, it is an expensive hotel with not-so-great service, so I've only given its value 2 out of 5.",73
MBS,3,“Only pool and architecture is impressive...”,"...but the service is rather poor. Long waiting hours at reception and a lot of foreign staff from PRC who do not speak English. The pool or better the view from the pool is indeed great, but the place is very crowded. The rooms are nothing special either. The colossal structure of the building is impressive, but I do not really feel comfotable there. It's a one time thing: Been there, done that.",76
MBS,3,“once is enough”,"Busy large hotel over 2000 rooms so do not expect individual service, but the pool is worth while to visit. The lounge on top is lousy expensive even hotel guest have to pay entrance fee and just get a beer or long drink for it but no cocktail. Beautiful view in the night but no space to sit down and overcrowded. One night is enough for I like personal touches which you will not get here.",93
MBS,1,"“Don't fall for the hype, it's terrible.”","It's like a cross between a bad shopping centre and a public pool but a lot more expensive. Poor staff service seems to be the norm . The room has a cheap feel but what's really bizarre is that the good sized balcony has no furniture whatsoever ever. They don't seem to think this is in anyway strange when I asked but it means you cant use it. This is a very expensive place for what it is and what it delivers, I would not recommend that's you visit, you will be disappointed.",229
MBS,1,“Most disappointing experience ever.”,"We arrived full of expectation after we paid more than we normally would for a hotel. We are not even half way through our stay and I don't think I can remember all that is negative about this place. I shall list what I remember.The porter showed us our room, very nice, but pulled off a cupboard door as he showed us the facilities, asked us when would be a good time to come and repair it, it was left for 36 hours hanging off.The access to the pool is ridiculous, every day different requirements, sometimes having to show Id within the area after you have swiped in.Housekeeping , rooms not cleaned until late afternoon.Unable to use the fridge for your own requirements.Balcony empty, no furniture to sit on.A lot of staff have poor grasp of basic English.My elderly father was asked to stand up as he temporarily sat on the edge of a chair in an empty table.Over priced drinks.As my friend was talking, the staff removed her ($40) glass of champagne and made it a huge deal to replace it. It just seems a greedy, theme park of a hotel. It's a wannabe upmarket rip off. Nice pool, but take that away and all your left with is a sub standard, overpriced failing corporate failure which will date un no time at all. Don't stay here, seriously.",240
MBS,3,“Magnetic Card Door Entry does not work most of the time”,"1. Magnetic Card door entry does not work most of the timeIt seems that most of the 8 cards issued lose its magnetism after a few hours. Couldn’t use the lift or enter my own hotel room until I have the cards replaced again.2. Karaoke system is disappointing.Microphone does not work.The wireless system picks up the voices of singers in other rooms!The technical staff took about 45 min, 3 trips and 4 officers to get the system fixed at 11.30 pm.System fails again the next morning at 10.30 am.Remote control seems to be very “low level”: how come it does not have a “return” button to return to the previous screen? Therefore, at MBS, I have to return to the main menu all over again to select a song. Very troublesome.3. Room door is too narrowFor such a luxurious and spacious suite, it is strange that the room doors are narrower than the usual HDB room doors. The baby cot cannot go through, and it has to remain in the living room :=(4. After checking out, it’s another long wait to pay for valet parking.Why subject every hotel guest the trouble of queueing to pay for $12 valet parking? It takes minutes for each guest to swipe and sign their credit cards to complete the payment process.Why not just increase the hotel rates of every room by $12? Then, the waiting time for collection of cars could be vastly shortened!",85
MBS,3,“Too many people”,"Buildings and interior designs are fantastic. There are 3 buildings for guest rooms, so it is quite crowded and busy. Even at the pool , i arrived at 8.30am, there were so many people. The room price are too pricey and not worth for service. Pillow sheets and blankets are not well maintenance ( smell bad). At first , i thought it was only my set of pillows and i asked my sister in the other room , she said her pillows smell bad too.",189
MBS,2,"“Low Service Level, Bad Location”","If you go to Singapore for gambling - it's the place to stay. There is NO OTHER REASON to stay at this hotel.Many things went wrong when I stayed there - I had booked a Suite with city view and was checked into a Suite with sea view first. After I complained at the club (on the top of the building close to the swimming pool) I was moved to the correct suite. Rooms are nice and modern, hotel is huge and does not have enough staff. The club upstairs is always full, sometimes difficult to get a table in the morning for breakfast - small trouble everywhere. Swimming Pool is overloaded, very crowded, lots of Asian customers, noisy - not enjoyable. All the ambience is killed by the general attitude of the crowd - not to my liking.The rooms are very expensive, even for Singapore. All that just does not fit together. If you want to stay in a little bit more expensive and exclusive hotel - don't stay at the Sands. This is a hotel for Asian gambler, that are willing to pay much too high prices.",159
MBS,3,“Stayed for the pool”,"I stayed here only to experience the crazy pool. I arrived to the pool at 5:00 PM - it was super crowded. I then came at 9:00 PM, the pool was still very crowded - there was even some trash floating around. I came again at 6:00 AM - the opening time - and was one of 10 people or so but could not take pictures as it was still dark! So, I would not stay for the pool....The room was surprisingly nice - very large! But the hotel is way to large to feel like a true guest, even though the staff really tries. The breakfast buffet at \Rise\"" was ample but of an average quality. It was included in the rate, but if I had to pay $30 for separately it would not be worth it. Overall, I am not sure my $350/night was worth it, but for a once in a lifetime experience, it was Ok.""",69
MBS,3,“not as good as i expected”,"hotel is huge, great design but not pay attention to details. The room is average, not 5 stars standard. Food at the pool sucks, chicken basket extremely salty, salad soaked in salad dressing, also very very salty. Pool has excellent view but since it is open for public at 20 singapore dollar, u will find lot of tourist standing behind u staring when u swim. definitely not going back.....",371
MBS,2,“Disappointing; Not recommended”,"Despite spending S$400plus for a night stay at the Premier Room last week, we were very disappointed by the service offered from the rude staff!First, checking in process was quite smooth. We reached the hotel at around 4pm, although there was a little wait at the Front Desk, the Front Office staff (Anne) was friendly and apologetic while trying hard to get us a room.About the room, it falls below our expectations. The view wasn't fantastic and lacks the 'premium' feel. Furthermore, we understand that the hotel wanted to personalize their guests' experience, but, they got the other guest's name for the greeting shown on the TV screen for the whole stay.. Personalised touch - ruined.We ordered room service and the service and food were good. Late at night, we called the concierge for a couple of bath towels and it was delivered shortly after. Thank you for that! :)The next morning, 2 of us went to the Skypark with 1 keycard. However, WE WERE DENIED ENTRY! The security staff (MICHAEL) insisted that 1 keycard only entitles 1 guest to enter. But, the night before we entered using 2 keycards for 3 persons!! And he kept questioning about our age, doubting us when we already answered him. Not wanting to make a big fuss and spoil our mood, we decided to go back to our room and take the other card. While waiting for the lift, he called us back, \Hey!\"" and filled in a 'Incidental Report' in front of us, stating 1 of us forgot to bring the keycard before he allowed us access to the pool. After about an hour while we were leaving, MICHAEL called us from the back, \""Hey You!\"" (with the hand sign like calling a DOG) and questioned us AGAIN about our age!! We answered him again and he kept on questioning! This is INTOLERABLE, OFFENSIVE and ANNOYING!!I would strongly suggest the hotel to train their staff how to greet a guest before anything else. This is such a basic thing yet it is not achieved. It is really disappointing to get this from a 5* star with the amount we pay. The rudeness of staff MICHAEL completely ruins our impression and experience in MBS..""",276
MBS,2,“Just visit - don't stay”,"We had the opportunity to stay at MBS in a suite for a night a few months ago. The architecture and views from the top are impressive, but unless gambling is your main aim (or you have no other accommodation options!), wouldn’t suggest staying there. Staff had zero charm – from the people at check in/out to those on the floor. No one went out of their way to be pleasant, or make us feel welcome (and we were in a suite!). But what took the cake was the bouncer at their club, Ku de ta, who told us that he “didn’t like our face” so wouldn’t allow entry. We were dressed appropriately, polite, staying guests at the hotel ... speechless. Other observations: Rooms are characterless and very ordinary. Dull, dated furniture, which is already looking tired and cheap. Bathroom is very large, as is the shower itself, but it literally only had a shower - there was nowhere to even place your bar of soap! There was no turndown service which was rather a surprise, as it is such a standard hotel service. Probably due to its size, the place is a zoo – from arriving at the taxi stand, to the lobby/public area, the ‘restricted’ lounge area , the pool, breakfast. If you’re looking for a relaxing time, this is not the place. Breakfast quality and selection is below standard of other similarly ranked/priced hotels. It has none of the finer details that branded, 5-star hotels pride themselves on – just its size and the view (which you can get if you dine at one the outlets). Just visit the place – don’t stay.",492
MBS,3,“Nice hotel but very dissapointing service”,"We were on holiday at the time of our daughters 21st Birthday - that's a one off event - with that in mind we selected MBS with two considerations 1) The hotel quality/pool novelty 2) An expectation of high quality service. And the result was.....1) Hotel Quality:Nice hotel, nicely designed with a really great infinity pool on the 57th floor, nice rooms, amazing views of the city, good breakfast (albeit very busy), etc, etc. Without doubt go for the city view rooms.2) Hotel Service:Appalling, possibly amongst the lowest I have seen in the world. When booking it is almost impossible to connect with any real person before arrival, upon arrival (after 5pm) only one of the rooms I had booked (and was now paying for) was available and the requests I had made at booking were not honoured - some of them were honoured after significant complaints were made but not all. The \express service\"" staff were robotic in their responses and seemed to lack any ability to make customer oriented decisions themselves. The most frustrating thing was that a member of staff personally promised me that my daughters birthday cake would be delivered to the room at a specific time for the birthday celebration - when we got to the room at the agreed time - no cake, nothing! wholly disappointing for a hotel of this calibre. To be fair there was one member of management who personally addressed the cake situation with a genuine apology and honest professionalism which we truly appreciated (thankyou Lynda).On reflection, this hotel is too big to be able to provide any kind of personal level of service and I should have realised that on booking - the lack of responsiveness to my requests when booking were a warning sign but you live and learn as they say. I kept my side of the bargain and paid the full rate I committed to for my rooms -- however Marina Bay Sands failed to keep their side of the bargain and provide what I had paid for - I find that disappointing and I left with a net impression that the hotel management are focused on money only and fail to realise that in this business reputation and service are critical differentiators in the long run.My advice: this hotel is well located and nicely designed, the pool 57 floors above the city is a great concept with great views, however if you also expect good service then I'd suggest other hotels who know how to do this properly. You can always go to MBS for breakfast or for a trip up to the skypark for the view if you are so inclined - if you want both the pool and the service then I'd do one night at MBS, experience the pool but then do your other nights in Fullerton or Raffles for reliable service, with hindsight that's what I should have done for our birthday celebration.""",74
MBS,3,“Experience at Marina Bay Sands”,"Excellent front office and airport shuttle service very pleased of the experience. But thoroughly disappointed thereafter, crowded breakfast area stand in queues for such an expensive hotel is shameful. Too much crowd in the lobby as people allowed on payment for observatory, too many rooms and feel lost of privacy. Big rooms with beautiful toilets but very small wardrobes, i find that ridiculous! Staff are so overstretched they become unfriendly due to the crowds.",103
MBS,2,“It was unpleasant..”,"Apart from the awesome pool everything else pales. In room TV programs were extremely limited, buffet breakfast at Rise was way below average with uncooked food served to customers, inconsistent standards of the room housekeeping, one day the bin was cleared, the next day it wasn't cleared, wet bath robes folded and put on our bed and many more unpleasant surprises. It was supposed to be a celebration of my partner's birthday but turned out that he remarked the quality as on par with a 3 stars hotel or worse. We will share our true experiences with everyone else about Marina Bay Sands.",67
MBS,3,“Not a qualified 5 star hotel”,"It's a cool building with nice shopping mall and a great city- view swimming pool, but, as a 5 star hotel it's not qualified. The staffs are not very friendly, no luggage services, the air condition of the room is too noisy! Also, there's a little locked misterious room next to our bed which makes water noises. 499+ per night, I don't think it worth that price.",98
MBS,2,"“UNFRIENDLY STAFF, AVERAGE ROOM, BUT GREAT VIEW OF THE CITY”","Very expensive hotel S$400++ per night equal to usd$ 321++, but for this price trust me you don't get what your expect. The hotel is massive on the outside, have a nice lobby and giant shopping mall. But all that become nothing since the staff especially the receptionist staff is very unfriendly and unhelpful also the room is nothing fancy to talk about. So my suggestion is just stay at another hotel and just pay a visit to the hotel just for sightseeing. Trust me for the price you pay you will expect more than a Great view.",422
MBS,3,"“Great location, but really disappointing about the service”","We stayed at Marina Bay Sands only one night on 11 July. The location was amazing and we could go to sky park for free, where we had to pay last time in Singapore. However, the services there were really disappointing!!! What we can share with other travellers is please, please check your room type!!!! We booked two rooms with Premier City View. We left the airport at 5:00 pm by the shuttle bus, and luckily, the waiting time for check-in wasn't too long. However, after check-in, we need wait another 30 min to get into the room??? Does that mean if we arrived at 3:00 pm, which is your official check-in time, we need wait for 3 hours??? At around 6:20, we finally got into the room, we were surprised that what we can see from our window were just some boats and one of our room even no balcony, so we can't see too many boats… It was too hungry to argue with the reception because of the long queue after 6:30 pm. We were back to hotel at around 11:30 pm. The reception told us it was a mistake, they gave us wrong type of rooms, what he can do for us was to change rooms for us, but we need to move to another tower, it was too late, we didn't want to move. We hope we could get refund, but he told us that we couldn't because we booked through Agoda, not directly from hotel itself. Was this the reason they treat customer differently? Then, the reception gave us 100 credits for each room. We were all exhausted, just wanted a sleep after a long day travel, and we were leaving the next day, so we accepted. However, it doesn't mean we like their way of doing things!!!It was not our fault!!! They gave us a wrong room, and then give us 100 credit, that's it??? The next day, when we checked out, the reception still charged us for the breakfast fees, without deducting the 200 credits, we need to explain again. And, she checked our card three times because of some unexpected mistakes. Again, not our mistakes. Well, it was so lucky that we didn't choose express check out, otherwise, we might need call from oversea to talk about the wrong charge. So, I'm wondering if she is a trainee or not familiar with the system, could the hotel please arrange any supervisor for the staff? Anyway, shopping there was great, just not happy about services.",168
MBS,3,“Terrible Service and Lack of Concern takes away the charm of the beautiful view and marvelous Structure”,"The first impression of the hotel was excellent. nice big rooms, the swimming pool is truly a site and the beautiful views from the skypark. The art gallery, shopping center and casino are good too. I personally didn't find the food court very fascinating. The hotel is so crowded and busy 24 hours of the day, you feel like you are in a mall.If you are looking for a relaxing and quiet holiday, this is definitely not the place to go. You would be better of staying at a different hotel and visiting here for a day.I was shocked at the lack of concern the hotel staff had towards us, it seemed like they didnt care one bit whether we were there or not. I did speak to a couple of the duty managers about how i felt but then again I realized I was just wasting my time.To sum it up this hotel is not worth staying, yes a day trip to the hotel would be nice..",166

Lunch in the bar in the roof park gave both me and my boyfriend half a day of food poisoning! From sandwich / burger. Not cool....2. When we arrived at 3 pm, three of the luggage-guys/door-men told us that there was no room ready for us, and we should leave the luggage and come back later. Clearly they did this because of the line at the check in desk. Waited 20 min (!) in line to check in. Not cool...3. The roof park with the pool is overrated. This area should be so much nicer... And we didn't find any showers. Guess people just jumped in dirty...""",268
MBS,3,“Nothing that fantastic”,"I was really looking forward to having a staycation at this hotel after hearing so much... but at the reception, we were greeted by many visitors all waiting to check in... it was chaotic and noisy... upon check in, when we went into the room, we realise that there were no bath tubs (We were later told that because we stayed in Tower 3, there were no bath tubs.). For a hotel of this class, I was expecting alot better... However, I must say that we got a great view of the garden from our room, which compensated for all the bad experience for the trip... I had some issues bringing guests up to my room tho I understand that for security purpose, there were restrictions on the number of guests (Just one guest per key card) we can bring up to the room. The way we were stopped can be improved... The next morning we visited the famed pool as there were simply too many visitors at the pool the previous evening. While there were still many visitors, we manage to find a corner to wade around. The view from up there is really beautiful and you can't deny that good feel regardless how disappointed you are with the overall hotel experience. You can't swim in the swimming pool since the sheer number of visitors does not allow that. You would probably bump yourself against another swimmer in less than 10 seconds. We had some issues going back to our room later on as our keycards were not programmed correctly for the extended check out we requested...",538
MBS,1,"“Horrible, Terrible, Avoid at all costs.”","We decided on this hotel despite the poor reviews, thinking that it's been over two years since they've opened, and the bad service must have been ironed out by now. WRONG!The person in the lobby directing us where to queue up for check in didn't know where the line was for those previously checked in online. Thus we had to wait in this normal line for quite a bit. The check in agent did not smile at all and seemed in a hurry to get to the next person. No personalized service here. Since both rooms were under my name, I asked if my father should sign for his room (so his signature would be recognized in food outlets when we were not eating together). She didn't want that. True enough, my father had trouble signing in a restaurant later in our stay. It's true that this hotel is too huge to feel at home in. No one seems to care what you need, or that you are a guest. You end up feeling like a speck of dust in this huge zoo of a hotel they claim to have a 5 star rating.On our last night, we decided to have our anniversary dinner at Sky on 57th, the restaurant on the top floor. We were only 2 couples. Since our reservation was for 830pm, we decided to have cocktails at 730pm at the same place. By 840pm we had to ask for our table as they had forgotten us. To make the long story short, by 955pm we had already asked twice for our main courses to be served. This was over an hour of waiting time. The explanation given to us?... That there was a big group at the other side. WHAT?! That they were given preferential treatment was adding insult to injury. An apology was given in the way of a fruit platter for dessert. We should have just stood up and left. WORST SERVICE EVER.Other small details added to this bad experience. A used ice bucket (filled with water) was not taken away until the day I checked out. My used coffee cup was just left on the sink with the dirty spoons in it. I requested my beddings changed, and they were not. How do I know? Because the stained (with black smudges) pillow case was still there. The pillow was not even put back on the bed, and just left on the couch. And, I saw clumps of what seemed like clear gel or petroleum jelly wiped on our door. I don't even want to think what that really was.Lastly, we tried to use the tv check out, and it failed. We check out thru \express check out\"" as per the instructions of the man in the desk. It's a small slip of paper that you sign allowing them to charge your bill to the credit card you presented at check in. It also says, a statement will be emailed to you.It's been 3 days since we left, and nothing has popped up in my email. This is very unprofessional. My emails asking for this statement have been ignored.Just as I said. This place is a zoo, not a 5 star hotel.""",44

I visited the signature pool on the 57th floor, but it was like a zoo. The changing area was so messy and therere were piles and piles of used towels left there uncollected. The stairways led down to the area was dirty, damp, and dusty. When I asked for the direction to the ladies locker, the staff was too busy to even give a direction.

We booked a Grand Room but was upgraded to a Suite because of the mixed up with my booking I made 2 months prior. The Suite had a wow factor about it but was downhill all the way after that. No power points other than the desk, the Nespresso machine was at the bottom drawer of a small cupboard and after you struggle to get it out, there was no power point to plug it it. The cups were small ones for expressos only. Checking out was difficult as the Statement was incorrect and another long wait before things got sorted. I don't think any negative review anywhere will improve management of this hotel as they are fully booked everyday of the year .

MBS,3,“One Time Only”,"MBS is the sort of place it's worth going at least once, if only to see it up close. Obviously, it's an impressive piece of work. The hardware is lovely. The staffing in fact is also pretty good. Especially in Singapore where staffing is a nightmare for every employer, they have done an excellent job of not only getting bodies but in fact qualified ones. I can say the service is good - even excellent - given the sheer size of the place plus the volume and hordes of, um, interesting guests. They answer the phones promptly and actually attend personally to stuff. Strange but true. Also strangely enough, they don't throw the casino up your nose at every chance like Vegas does or Macau. I am guessing this was a SG Govt requirement, but the casino is in fact housed in a shopping mall next to the hotel and a good 15 minute walk from your room. You have to bring your passport (?!?) if you want to get in, which considering no reasonable person would be prepared for this means a 45 minute trip including going there, being refused, going back to the room, AND walking back again - all to give away lots of cash while breathing secondhand smoke amidst thousands of chinese mainlanders - I assume had to mean no one would do it. I'm wrong, though. The place was packed. Of course. But my point is that the casino shtick is very subtle. You don't have to hike through nine miles of slot machines to get to your room, like you do in Vegas or Macau. Rooms are big, and well-done. Standard mid-luxury 5-star casino hotel setup. Nicer than the Bellagio in Vegas, and about on par with Venetian in Macau, but not quite as nice as Wynn in either. Happy days, though. Lovely beds and pillows. They do give you a hot-water kettle too, so none of that petty Vegas scam here. The check-in wasn't much of a palaver nor was check-out - two achilles' heels of these type places - so again, well-done. I also have to say that by comparison to the rest of Singapore (which is already an enormous ripoff), MBS actually isn't too bad. A Tiger draft at the pool was S$12 including the usual 17% (not the typical after-add sleight of hand cheat you get in town, making it S$10 at town prices) which is oddly at least 40% cheaper than a beer at Clark Quay or Orchard. Considering they have you captive, this is a remarkable piece of restraint. Food prices also on par. The major disappointment was the pool. Or in fact not the pool per se, but who was in it. The 57th floor \skypark\"" is a marvel. The infinity edge, the setup, the lounge beds, even the relatively attentive and clueful staff - all great. The view is incomparable. But the clientele disappoints. I don't know how else to put it. Given the stage, the actors should be well-heeled, sophisticated, attractive. On a transit somewhere between Cap Ferrat and Phuket… Alas, not. Imagine a bus pulled up and disgorged a package tour from every nearby country at once, and you pretty much have the idea. Mommy, daddy, grandma, auntie, and the 3 kids, apparently first time from home! With attendant paraphernalia. And my God, the picture taking. It peaks in the morning and especially after about 5 pm. From 11-5 we found they hide from the sun and it's almost pleasant. After that, run for your life. We were there only for the pool - for 2 days - and we didn't go at all the second day. We just couldn't face it. Ku De Ta is also very disappointing. In Bali, we stay at the Legian next door to KDT and have a great time there. This is a poor copy - a leverage of the name for cash with no resemblance. In Bali, no dress code of course (it is a beach club after all) but here they have one, although apparently hotel slippers and robes will work because people in there were wearing them. Supposed to be young, hip, swanky? Not. It was in fact full with 40 and 50-somethings on an aircraft parts convention. 70% of it is roped off for people other than you. Whom, not sure. Not you, though. And in the sliver of space left to us, cocktails are S$32 (plus, plus, plus of course). I was told I could have a table if I bought a S$2400 bottle of vodka though (cost equivalent to 12 nights' stay - hmmm). DB Bistro for dinner and the Coffee Bean for breakfast, both in the mall next door are worth a visit. There is a 7-11 in that same mall but it's a hike and would recommend you stock up before you check in. In all, worth the one-time trip. Wouldn't return unless they can sort out the guest list, which isn't likely.""",255
MBS,2,“Dissapointing for the Cost”,"Dissapointing for the cost says it all, checkin staff were the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore, and I am there 3/4 times a year, but that is possibly due to over work. The security is excessive and intrusive, swiping to get to everywhere including the pool that you can only get to after having swiped the lift! service in the bars, particularily at the 57th floor was the worst of any hotel I have ever stayed at! 25min to get your room card back after trying to pay the check is ridiculous; try getting a round in on a busy night and you can nearly die of thirst! This is a \venue\"" hotel for those who like to gamble and shop, it is worse than Vegas. If you like Vegas or Cruise ships lacking style or service you will like this hotel but the website should make that clear. The rooms are nothing to write home about and after three nights I was glad to check out and will never be going back! The food is expensive and pretty poor, if an American chain cant train staff to make a club sandwich they should give up! If a Singapore can't serve asian food better than a street vendor they should give up! both were true at the MBS sorry but get your executive chef team out there under cover and motivate the team; you can do better and you know it, or this will soone become an Asian White Elephant of a hotel.""",31
MBS,3,“A good experience”,Good location with good experience of the pool but below 4 star services.The breakfast is very simple and not even as 4 star hotels.The pool does not have any changing room!,86
MBS,3,“A tad overcrowded”,"My family and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands earlier this month, and was not disappointed. We were pleased with the quality of the room, view and cleanliness. However, MBS is doing so well, with over 95% occupancy that it is bursting at the seams. Queues at registration, lots of people in the lobby/podium (which is way too narrow in my view), and curious tourists and locals trying to get to the skypark.To MBS' credit, the front desk service was good, inspite of the crowd.",106
MBS,3,"“Shows well, but would not select it again.”","Reminded me of a Las Vegas hotel. Big and beautiful with below average service. Room service was late and messed up order. Long lines at check in and check out. Asked them to press a few things and they rush dry-cleaned most of my stuff and charged me for it. Still have not figured out the right person who will \try\"" to credit me - been bounced around again and again. On other hand, if you are looking for a casino hotel and don't care about the service - not a bad choice. Service can be so great in Singapore so this hotel suffers by comparison.""",88
MBS,3,“Great architecture but bad service”,"Stayed 2 nights and were disappointed by the service. Some examples: Arrival: No bell boy available = take your luggage by your own out of the taxi, Long (15-20 min) waiting queue, then got a smoker's room (which we could change after another 15 min. wait)Skypark: If you want to order a beer and some french fries you have to wait and wait and wait. (not yet even high season...) Concierge service was fine and the pool is a must have seen/experienced! PS: rooms are not good isolated.",238
MBS,3,“Too big”,"Stayed at marina bay sands from 14th July for 3 nights on return to Australia from Europe. We booked a club room which was very nice and worth the extra. The club lounge on level 57 poolside had a nice breakfast but no lounge area to sit and enjoy a drink only tabes and chairs. Staff in the lounge had addressed us by name by the end of the 1st day and were extremely nice and helpful. Pool is nice but unfortunately during our stay there were 1,500 flight centre staff there for some sort of global ball and pool area was taken over and a nightmare with a few out of control drunks who should have been kicked out by their management especially after throwing one of the lifeguards into the pool and not letting him out After most had departed it became civilized again. We like action but people drinking kegs after being up all night in the pool at 9.00am was off putting, especially when there was so many of them. For reference the last section of the pool near the sky bar is adults only which is a bonus and the lifeguards are quite vigilant to keep it that way. All in all a nice hotel if you like massive hotels but not if you like more luxurious boutique style. Possibly the influx of the out of control flight centre staff put us off.",261
MBS,3,"“Impressively humongous, but impersonal”","It's a fabulously impressive and huge structure which dominates the Qauy area landscape of Singapore and one would definitely feel proud of staying here. The scales of construction and design are impressive. However, if there were an assembly line of a hotel, then this would be it. The service is usually efficient, but extremely impersonal and you can feel that the staff is under pressure to complete ther assinments in a hurry. With such a large clientele to cater to, one can understand the pressure, but it takes away from a relaxing and graceful experience oine would otherwise expect in a hotel of this category. The automatic settings in the room for lights and curtains went absolutely bonkers on our last day there and it was very tiresome , esp while using the bathroom which has no natural source of lighting. The large pool area is a big draw of course, and the gigantic mall as well as the conference facilities are very helpful additions. The arts and science museum was handy and an excellent add-on in terms of things- to-do. Basically, the hotel has many of the tourist destinations of Singapore within itself, which is a big plus for guests. It's location is extremely convenient as it is right in the tourist hub of Singapore. The food is also very good in terms of variety and taste. However the mechanical service and the too-huge scale of operations gives a feel of impersonality which is an anti-thesis of hospitality as I understand it. Somehow, the 'welcoming' feeling is totally missing here.",198
MBS,3,“Great for short stay for views but overall experience mixed”,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights in May as a weekend treat after staying in another hotel in Orchard during the week. I was disappointed almost immediately by the crowded atrium lobby area (it was like a station concourse), check in queues and overworked staff. The room overlooking the city was excellent and made up for the poor initial reception. The view and light shows were stunning and the facilities very good.The roof top experience at sunset is spectacular however the service and drinks were poor. We had to wait ages to be served and when the very expensive drinks arrived they consisted mostly of ice! My advice would be to stay for 1 or 2 nights only for the views and experience but spend the rest of your stay in Singapore elsewhere. I would also recommend leaving the hotel for the bars below for a drink as the drinks served by the hotel are very expensive and very weak.We also went out for breakfast as the crowded atrium area was unappealing - a bit like sitting in Costa or Starbucks on a crowded station. Can recommend breakfast at The Fullerton Hotel across the water.",112
MBS,1,“A really horrible hotel”,I organised a conference at the Marina Bay Sands this year.I must say it was a terrible experience.The staff are rude and try to screw you for every last penny they can.The hotel has a great sky pool and bar. whci they try to make exclusive to guest (although they do make you feel very unwelcome if you are not wearing the right clothing)The bar itself ends up being full of women looking for business in the evenings which the hotel seems happy to allow!I would say the rooms themself are large and comfortable but I think you could get better and cheaper if you stayed elsewhere.I would never stay there again!,216
MBS,2,“Service not up to standard”,"The hotel is in a great spot, with unbelievable views and great amenities.However:Despite booking a room for 2 adults and 2 children, we found upon checking in that a room which could accommodate 4 people had not been reserved. Eventually we were told there was a room with a sofa bed in which would be suitable for our two children to share. The sofa bed was slightly wider than a single bed. Not really big enough for 2 children aged 7 and 10 to sleep well. My son ended up sleeping on the floor on the cushions from the sofa bed.The infinity pool - spectacular- shame about the floating/suspended debris. There was not enough seating and having waited 20 min to place a food/ drink order, I was advised not to bother as it would take at least 2 hours to arrive!Room service??? Despite pressing the button to alert that we were out and we would like the room servicing. It took until 6 pm!Hotel has lots of security staff (to stop jumpers from casino?) but nowhere near enough staff to look after guests.The view from the room was fantastic and the pool was spectacular but for the money it costs to stay there I would have like for there to have been much better service",277
MBS,2,“Won't be staying again!”,"My husband and I have stayed twice at Marina Bay Sands (MBS). We won’t be staying a third time.MBS is very noisy. One side of the hotel faces a multi-lane highway and the rooms are not insulated enough to block out the noise of traffic. The hotel lobby is constantly packed and the atrium design of the hotel means that noise reverberates making it impossible to enjoy a quiet meal or drink at the downstairs restaurants or bars. The atrium design also means that rooms on the lower floors get traffic noise from one side and lobby noise from the other!We were woken at 6am by the hotel trying to deliver a breakfast which we hadn’t ordered. Following a complaint it was discovered the hotel had mistakenly used the breakfast card we used the previous day - the breakfast cards don’t request a date so this mistake can easily occur. We were compensated with a free breakfast but I expect better from a 5 star hotel.We discovered our quilt was frayed and had a large hole, room service forgot to replace 1 dressing down (there is a $60 charge if you take it) and during both stays we had to change our room key cards as they stopped working.To top it off, the Concierge directed us to where we could get a free bus to Universal Studios but forgot to tell us we needed to show the bus driver our passports. As we didn't have our passports the bus driver wouldn’t let us on the bus and we had to get a Taxi!MBS is a tourist trap. For the price there are far better options in Singapore.",247
MBS,3,“Can be better..”,"Hotel stay was so enjoyable with some minor hiccup as follow.This hotel has a check in time of 3pm and early check out of 11am. We requested for a late check out and was told that it can only be extended to 12noon which i thought is the usual checkout time for most hotels in Singapore.My check in was delayed until 330pm as the room is not ready at 3pm so i thought the 12noon extended checkout time was rather insignificant.The room was in good condition, spacious with nice city view.Wanted to log on to free wifi with hotel password but realized the wifi logon page was down, called for technical support and it took close to 20 min for an IT guy to come to our room to tell us the logon page was not working properly and has to be shutdown so that we can logon wifi without signing in. In the morning when i turn on the TV, there is an error message that says TV interactive system is down. Call for support and the staff has to shift the TV cabinet slightly out to reach out to switch off and on the power for the TV system to work. Late morning, one staff came knocking at our door even though our \do not disturb\"" sign is on, he requested to check on the mini bar. I am puzzled why is there an \""urgency\"" to come in just to check on the mini bar.""",139
MBS,2,“Took my without any reason...”,"My trip was 8th April. I spent a night in the CLUB ROOM with my boyfriend. Room is lovely, services is good.The pool is amazing but with lots of people. The CLUB ROOM price is included afternnon tea and champagne pre dinner snack, so we spent most of the time in the hotel. However we been advices that we can choose to have our breakfast in any restaurant and all the non alchohol drink are free as well. Lastly I receive a bills and the money taken from my card without any invoice. I still waiting for refund and explaination regarding the wrong information adviced when we check in. Quality of the hotel is good.Services in the hotel is poor.Customer services is ridiculour poor.I won't advices to put your card as deposit as they took money as they like.",94
MBS,3,“Ants in our bed”,The Marina Bay Sands (MBS) was a very convenient hotel for attending a recent trade show but the low point of our stay was to find our bed infested with small ants. This was a first for me despite having stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years. MBS is a typical Las Vegas hotel set in Singapore... very large... with a lobby like Central Station..and although the room was nicely appointed we felt the bed lacked comfort and the sheets were of poor quality. Would I stay there again... only for business convenience.,112
MBS,3,“Amazing pool but place is a zoo”,"Walking into the hotel lobby feels like being at Heathrow. At any time of day this hotel is packed to the rafters with guests and gawkers. However the hotel staff are very efficient and the check in is quick. Up past the security guards (feels like getting into a night club) to the rooms which are plush and comfortable although the pull out couch is not. The pool is DEVINE but very crowded even at 10pm at night. You definitely can't swim as there are too many people in the pool looking at the view and taking photos. Buffet breakfast just average. In sum, glad I went but won't be hurrying back.",877
MBS,3,“If you can get past the miserable check-in experience a better experience awaits”,"I chose this hotel as a base for a business trip mainly for the swimming pool experience. For the better part of a month before arriving I read countless reviews with horror stories with respect to check-in. So to no surprise when I arrived at the hotel at 6:45am after the longest commercial non-stop flight in the world (EWR-SIN), it was no surprise that even at this hour well before the lines formed the front desk service was crap! I had booked a room the night prior to my arrival to avoid issues. I paid for a city view Superior room and my room on arrival was a garden view on a lower floor. I would not occupy it. I asked for an upgrade to Club with a city view since on the way from the airport my assistant confirmed that club rooms were available. Upon my arrival I was told this hotel of over 4,000 rooms was completely sold out. I was told the internet site was not updated? Not taking that for an answer I asked to see a manager. This process took over 25 minutes. The reception area is literally like a check-in counter at an airport, with the attitude to boot. Upon speaking with the manager I received my room request however I would have to wait until 11am to check in. I was sent to the second floor holding room, where I was told I could relax and take a shower and use the facilities. When I arrived in that room, it was already loaded with other disgruntled clients waiting to check in. In fact there were so many people in that room, I felt like I was tossed into a shipping container with 100 other people of which I was the only english speaking caucasian. I went back down to the front desk and demanded to not be placed in that waiting area. This is when the manager apologized and offered that since I had paid for an upgraded Club Room, I should be waiting in the VIP area. (seating was available there). To his credit my room was ready by 8:30am and it was spacious with an enviable view of the city. But no apologies were given for my mis-booked pre-paid room from the night earlier and no credit was offered. The pool experience is one not to be missed. Staff was friendly offering to take pictures, service was great. Definitely worth the experience. The Club on 57 had very friendly servers good selection of food for breakfast and evening drinks. The servers were very nice and greeted you by name. This was pretty impressive for this monstrosity of a hotel. You really felt like you were at a smaller hotel with the personal attention. Midweek the weather looked threatening and wanted an umbrella to take to client meetings. This is where another horror story began. No umbrella in the room, I went down to the VIP concierge who directed me to Tower 1 concierge. This was around 11am. When I looked at the line at the concierge desk I was horrified that a hotel of this size only had 3 employees behind the desk. The queue was at least 45 minutes long to speak with one of them. Turning around I saw the check-in counter with scores of tired and defeated looking guests either waiting for a room or just waiting in-line for checkin. I would highly recommend not checking into this hotel after 9am! It looked like some people were waiting for an hour. This area of the hotel, the gateway to the MBS experience was woefully understaffed and the employees were miserable and outright rude and nasty, making the initial impression quite maddening. I finally got an umbrella after just walking behind the desk myself and grabbing one! Other areas of the hotel. The light show was phenomenal the shopping area was nice. The casino experience was awful. Despite winning a few hundred bucks, I left with sore lungs as everyone in there was a smoker! If you could stand 20 minutes of pure second-hand smoke hell, then you were immune for the night. It really was gross to try to gasp for clean air in a hall full of chain smoking gamblers at every chair of every table and every slot machine. If you left, you needed to get back in the queue to show your passport and there was only one entry area in the entire casino in which foreigners could enter. Very inconvenient. It seemed with the exception of the Club on 57 and the pool, MBS is definitely NOT a well run hotel, but a tourist factory. It's definitely worth the experience of going once, but I would never return. On check-out, I asked for my casino credit to be applied to my bill, which is what I clearly had gotten using my MBS players card, but the credit was never applied. So even the check-out experience left me wondering why I would ever return here. I guess I would if I brought my family back so they could experience the Pool, but that's it. Never again, when there are so many better run hotels in Singapore. TRAVELLER BEWARE OF CHECK-IN/ CHECK-OUT EXPERIENCE!!!",70
MBS,2,“Had to wait until 7pm for room”,Our first impressions unfortunately of this hotel were not great. Having prepurchased the room we were forced to wait 1 hour for it to become available (at 7pm). It wasn't the cleanest either and hadn't been vacuumed. We were given a 50SGD voucher for our troubles! Nonetheless the rest of the stay was unremarkable. We had a great view in the city rooms and the pool is definitely the highlight,89
MBS,3,“Tourist Trap”,Well...it looks beaitiful...its big...its got a casino...its got a shopping mall BUT its a tourist trap at best. Check-in takes about 45 mins (dont ask me why...maybe because they have a few thousand rooms)....check-out takes even longer (atleast an hour).They allow tourists to pay a few bucks and come see their swimming pool and loiter around in their lobby (thats why its always full of people). I personally would never stay in this hotel again. Rooms are decent and views are good but thats for most hotels in singapore.,53
MBS,3,"“Great view, poor standards.”","It is genuinley a great location. BUT too big. Rooms are already worn out (I have stayed 3 times since Jan 2010(.

MBS,2,"“Excellent Facilities, Poor/Lazy Services”","1. Note you can hardly find a smiling staff (concierge is the worst - it is the laziest, the rudest people I've encountered in any five stars hotel). After a long wait they will give a quick (impatient) condescending glance as signal that it was now your turn to be 'served'.2. Ask for an extra pillow from the PREMIER service and they would sound so displeased to know that you need an extra pillow on top of the one place on the wardrobe.3. The room is average (certainly far below St Regis' standard) but the view on the sky park is fabulous.4. The next time around I would skip the hotel and pay my way to the sky park. For one I am too much into rude, condescending and lazy services even if they are twinned with excellent facilities.",172
MBS,3,“Some bits good some bit not so good.....”,"I stayed in the Marina suite for 4 days ~ 200m2 cost $7,810 for suite only...Good bits:* Excellent butlers - very personable.* Great iconic infinity edge pool with great views.Bad bits:* Slow check-in even with the VIP/Executive checkin desk.* The Marina suites although very nice are facing the back rather than the more interesting city view (in my opinion).* Very busy place and once out of your suite you realize you are in a very mass market place and treated as such.* Although a really cool swimming pool the space on the roof with the number of people can make you feel like you are in a 3* hotel.* I tried to go to one of the restaurants on the roof, accompanied by a stunning super model and we we declined entrance. I was not wearing shorts and she was beautifully dressed. First time in my life I have been declined to enter a place ...and I have sure been to the top VIP places in almost every city in the world!",63
MBS,3,“Wow”,Superb hotel and what an amazing swimming pool view. Excellent staff and location. But there are certain issues we had during our stay.1. Couldn’t find tasty vegetarian food.2. The water in the swimming was very very cold. 3. Check in took awfully long time. Apart from that the stay was great. It had a great night club along with a wonderful shopping mall.,529
MBS,2,"“MAYBE A GOOD CASINO BUT DEFINATELY NOT A 5 STARS, AT VERY MOST A 3 and a half STARS.”","I stayed at this hotel from June 1st to 4th 2012.In that short period of time , I had to change rooms 4 times, to find a liveable room.I arrived at 3 am to this hotel due to the ungodly hours of my flight .When I checked into this hotel, the computer was down , therefore, the receptionist could not be much help. Out of usual habbits, upon checked in , I start to read abt guide-lines to the hotel and then thein room dinning menu. To my shock a lizard jump out, shocked , I dailed 0 and asked for manageron duty, instead came, a guest service agent. He tried his best to help , first he called the house-keeping, then came a young room boy, who then called for pest control. But I said pls wait for theduty manager as i want to see, how she or he was concerned abt his hotel ???. Mine was non-smoking rooms.We waited for 30 minutes, then, the young house-keeping boy had to use a towel to get rid of the lizard, still no duty manager came instead the house-keeping manager came, she wasspeaking in english that ,only she can understand. I then had to ask her , what was she saying, finally,I understood that she was saying, pls go to sleep as the lizard is gone now. I was shocked, and I begining to ask her, DO U THINK I WILL, IN THIS SAME ROOM ???. Yes, she answered.Then ,I clearly told her calmly, No, I will not. Pls give me a new room. by which the guest service agent kindly took me to the V.I.P lounge and even gave me a cup of hot tea.Then, the receptionist at the lounge asked me, what had happened, I carefully decribe the incident to her, then she called her co-workers and laugh in her own dialet.I was shocked. Then, she came back to me and said no roomsto-night and we cannot refund u,as u have paid in advance.I was very shocked that I demanded to see the manager on duty. In 10 minutes , a japanese front office manager arrived. She appolized and said but we have no room, therefore I said, do u know , what will happen in yr own country if this was yr answer ???. Then , she went to the computer and found me a room on the 8th floor. I checked in and was shock to find ladies hair and hair pins in the room but then I was too tired to call anyone, I just when to sleep.The next day, they gave me a room but without a bath tub. Then , we had to change rooms again toanother room which was dirty and ameties was half used. I called again by which they sent a damangecontrol gentleman to see what was wrong with my new room ???. by which they had the house keeper came to check and promised to clean up.Until then, I was shocked and wondering , what had happen to the good , from the heart service of 5 stars hotels and I wonder , how was 5 stars decided ???.",277
MBS,3,"“Noisy , Crowded, it was like checking-in in a mall.”","I went there for my honeymoon, after getting back from maldives, probably thats why I found it very noisy.Room: The room was very average, it was below my expectations, although they were aware that it was our honeymoon I expected bed decoration, nothing was done for us at all, not even a complementary drink or even chocolate. There was nothing marvelous in the room, not even the furniture. Our room type was supposed to be very good, it was a Deluxe room I found it average or it can go below average from some.. Lobby: it was very noisy and extremely busy and crowded all day, I think dining there will be more like dining in a luxury food court.Hotel location: That was the only advantage about the hotel. The hotel and its surrounding area is really all what you need to see in singapore. The mall was amazing. The outside area is very beautiful especially at night. the waterfront show was awesome. The pool: Hounestly I was very excited to see the pool and to try it. But when I reached there it looked nice at first but after a 10-20 min dip in the pool I would get bored. Maybe because I have seen too many pics of it. The pool was crowded too and it wasnt that sunny, actully it was raning. Probably thats was I didint find the pool to very attractive after all* Staff were very helpful and nice.* Room service was good , the burger was very delicious.* This hotel is not for a relaxing holiday at all, it was very hectic.

MBS,1,“Woken by Hotel staff at 2:30am in the Middle of Night”,"I stayed in Marina Bay Sands on 20/6/2012, I was woken by the hotel staff in the middle of night for \Technical Check\""It was 2:30am, I was sleeping tightly, someone knocked my door. I opened the door with the chain lock latched and asked who it was. A man about 40 years old said he wants to enter my room to do \""technical check\"" over the balcony. I was barely awake and couldn't respond to him immediately. I asked what's happening but he just repeated saying he needs to check the balcony (without identifying himself).I don't feel safe to open the door to stranger in the middle of night as I was just a female traveler. So I closed the door and intended to call front desk to ask what happened. Meanwhile, the man kept knocking the door hardly which made me feel nervous and uncomfortable.I opened the door again and saw another man in dark-blue uniform. Until that moment, no one told me who are they and why should I open the door. After a few seconds, altogether there were 4 men standing in front of my door, I opened it finally as I started to realize it is something big and urgent.Two men went straight to the balcony with torches in hands. They checked every inches of the balcony. Nothing was found. I was freaking out and didn't know how to react.Before they left the room, I asked again what happened. The man in uniform said \""Sorry, I cannot disclose too much!\""So, they just came in, checked, and left.I called the front desk and was told that it was just a \""Routine Security Check\""! With this ridiculous explanation from the hotel, I feel badly terrifying, and found it hard to resume to bed.In the following morning, I found out what happened from newspaper. Can't believe a 5 stars hotel would handle emergency incident in this way - intruding in guest room without giving a good explanation. I'm sure they can do something to avoid making hotel guest terrified and being disturbed :1. First thing they should do is to identify themselves - who they are!!! One is hotel security manager & one is police officer (?!)2. If they have to keep something confidential, they can tell me they want to check something was fallen to the balcony (for example a piece of glass). It will be better than leaving without a word and made me worried for the whole night.I'm completely disappointed with Marina Bay Sands Singapore after this horrible experience.""",318
MBS,3,"“A nice experience but too crowded, not value for money”","The view we had from our room was spectacular. That's the only wow factor I had during my stay here with my husband and 2 kids.We just stayed for 1 night just to get an experience of this hotel.We arrived at 10 a.m in the hotel, no body helped us with the luggage when our taxi stopped. I was dissapointed with this class of hotel.When we checked in we were given a resting room that was shared with other 4 people and card to the skypark, which was a very good initiative.We had a 2 super single beds in the room, the bed was too small. Big enough for me and 1 child, but in comparison with another hotel I stayed in which is lower in class with MBS, their bed was more decent.The bathroom was huge, had the bath tub, shower and two sinks. Very convinient.Everything was good upon checking in and during our stay. The breakfast was also good - the bread butter puding was the best!The famous swimming pool was OK. Maybe because it's soooo crowded with people, we couldn't enjoy it fully. The bell capten system was not the good, no clear queing, but we had a very helpful bell capten.Other good features are: MRT station is very near just around the corner, we had discounts in watching exhibitions because we stayed here and near to river cruise terminal if you're planning to go.The hotel's location is a bit distant from other places, so we would just go to the MBS mall. To go to other places you would switch 2-3 time MRT lanes, which was a bit of hassle.All in all, the room is great, but not really excited on the atmosphere of it and not appreciating the absence of bell captain upon arrival. It's not a must stay hotel for me, you can still have great views from other hotels in Singapore.",67
MBS,2,“A little slice of Dubai”,"Mega Hotel with a MEGA lobby. More like a train station. Actually I think the Marina Bay Sands' architects took their inspirations from the modern Chinese School of Railway station design. Anyway, completely lacking all personality and frigid. The rooms are quite standard, nothing special at all. Cigarette butts decorate the flower beds of your balcony. The pool is nice. The waiters are rude. Never going back.",113
MBS,2,“a price to pay”,"We stayed in the hotel for 4 days and 3 nights, taking 2 premiere rooms with the city view. Unknowingly, the price we paid for this hotel stay, we should've gone to australia, states or 5star hotel in KL!The staff in the restaurant were cold and distant, probably due to the huge restaurant. The food variety doesnt seem to be of equal standard.The pool and view may have been the reason why its costly. The advertisements of hotel on media definitely fooled us into spending our money.I wouldnt think of returning to this hotel for a second stay, unlike other international rsorts ive been too, this hotel just bade me and everlsting farewell.",113
MBS,3,"“Excellent pool, nice room, however impersonal and slow service”","The infinity pool is amazing and extremely relaxing and well worth at least a one time visit. We however found the hotel far too cold and Impersonal it is massive and you are just one of a crowd of people there is no special warmth or welcome feel.Our room was of generous size with a comftoable bed, with wonderful views, but the hotel was let down by extremely slow service, everything took a minimum of 20 to 40 minutes even a simple poolside drink or food order, in room food service was painfully slow especially to clear after delivery.The hotel is fascinating but was not our style and is not really child friendly.",440
MBS,3,“You can do better in Singapore”,"SOME RESERVATIONS: The Marina Bay is part of a large complex of shopping/restaurants, casino, exhibition and hotel and you easily spend your entire stay under the roof of this iconic Singapore building.As other reviewers have noted, the hotel itself seems to have no soul and the lobby feels more like you're entering an airport than a hotel. But what is important is the rooms themselves. First the negatives, my room on the 11th floor faced the sea and unfortunately it was begat by wind & traffic noise all night. Why the designer would put sliding doors in a hot n' humid environment (who would ever open the window) was sheer stupidty. I slept with ear plugs each night. I should have complained and moved to a higher floor but at these rooms rates ALL rooms should be excellent. This single element has forced a 3* rating from me, #1 on my list is the ability to sleep soundly and this hotel failed the test.The design flaws carried on with small but annoying factors. There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom and the single available one has no mirror (women take note). The bathroom has a small circular makeup mirror, but it's too low to be of any use. No grab bar in the shower and the residual cleaning solution quickly set the shower floor slippery, setting up for a possible accident. In the US, lawsuits galore!The room uses a key card to turn power on/off, unfortunately leaving the room turns off power to the alarm clock as well (which constantly flashed 12:00 at me until I unplugged it).Lighting switches were a test of logic and reach (the master OFF switch is a far reach from the bed and in fact doesn't turn everything off, nor can you find it easily in the dark). The automated curtains open and close when the room is powered and I was unsure what mood they were trying to set (they got out of sync quickly).All in all, I felt like someone had not thoroughly thought through the flow of a hotel guest stay.While the hotel is an icon in Singapore, it's a cab ride to virtually anything (including restaurants across the small harbor).On the positives, the room size is quite large, the bedding was of good quality and comfortable, the desk had adequate power and nicely equipped, wired internet was good and TV had plenty of channel selections.This hotel is by no means a dump, but Singapore has a sea of 5* hotels and competition is fierce and the short comings of this property have me searching for a new residence in Singapore.",159
MBS,3,“A big hotel - too busy for my taste”,"I stayed in this hotel in April 2012. From the outside, the hotel looks very impresive with the long boat structure at the top. But I changed my opinion, once I entered inside. I guess my expectation was a bit too high. The room was ok but not impressive. But the pool on the top of the hotel is very impressive and is great for picture taking. And the good thing is that only hotel guest are allowed to enter the poolside so this reduces the traffic. All in all, not a bad experience but it was a very busy hotel. A lot of people were wandering in the hotel lobby and it felt a bit like Genting highland Wonderworld in terms of the flow of people. I was there for a conference in the next building so the location was great. Overall, a great hotel for conference and gambling but I would not recommend it for pleasure though.",211
MBS,3,“Not the experience I had expected”,"Stayed 5 nights whilst attending a conference at the Suntec Convention centre. Chose this hotel because of the swimming pool. Totally overated. I can understand the management wanting to make the most of the pool and the views but it would be nice to have a separate elevator for hotel guests and visitors. During the rush where groups of tourists are waiting to get into the elevators, it was like trying to rush in to get into a busy Hong Kong subway train. If you were a hotel guest you had to push your way in and out of the elevators and this kept on going throughout the day till the late evening.The rooms were nicely appointed but the lobby was like a shopping mall filled with visitors. Any sense of exclusivisity was negated by the masses of visitors going up to the viewing deck.It was located reasonably well close to a new shopping mall, subway station and the casino but that's about it.The pool was like a wading pool with so many people that it was nothing more than a dipping pool. Only forgiving thing about the pool area was the view.For the price paid, I would choose other similarly rated properties where there is more privacy. Once is enough.!",104
MBS,3,"“Mehhh, it's ok”","First time in Singapore and wanted to experience two world renowned hotels- MBS and Raffles. Stayed the first 3 nights in Marina Bay Sands. Overall, I wasn't a big fan as I felt overwhelmed by the size of the hotel. No personal service and made me feel like 1 of 1 million guests. I'm not much of a gambler so I can't speak to the casino. The rooftop pool area is AMAZING- best I have ever seen with wonderful views of the city. However, the rooms were very unimpressive- as the most expensive hotel ever built, I felt like it was a bigger Marriott.",782
MBS,3,“Service can be better”,"Decided the write this review as we stayed there 5 times, out the the 5 times, there were 3 times the service was disappointing. The first time was fabulous. They got our booking correct. Correct room. Correct check-in time. Service was prompt. Room was neat and clean when we stepped in. Everything in the room was functioning. We booked a Grand Room. It was at the corner, 27th Floor, hence we had a good view - both sea view and city view. It was the National Day rehearsal that night, so we could see fireworks.Because of the great first stay, we decided to visit the second time. This time round we booked the Club Room. Club room was supposed to have a complimentary breakfast, high tea etc at The Club (sky cafe at the roof top), however, when we arrived at The Club, we were denied entry. After much discussion, and waiting for them to call the front office to clarify any doubts, they finally allowed us to enter. Well, despite that, i must say that the service in The Club was fantastic. The waitress were friendly and very helpful. The food is alright though there are many selection e.g. Salmon mousse, Angus Beef (bite size portion), cupcakes, Sashimi, desserts etc. When we checked out, they actually charged us for visiting The Club. Again, we had to wait for them to check this and that before the charges were waived. I don't understand what is so difficult/ confusing about their system?3rd time: we requested for the Grand Room instead of the Club room. The Grand room(79m) is much bigger than the Club room(61m), but the Club room is pricier due to the Club access & complimentary breakfast. This time round they checked us in only at 5pm :( however they did compensate us by giving us some dining vouchers. That we appreciate. Thank you. However the room was problematic despite the late check-in. Many of the lights were not working so we had to call the room service to come fix it. Ok, now next, the promised us a late check-out since they check us in late. However the next day, after our swim we were locked out of our room at 1130am. We had to go down to the conceirge in our bathing suits as we waited for a long time after calling them and no one came to our aid. When questioned, they said that it MUST be because we put our room cards near our phone hence we were locked out. Unconvinced, i went back to check the spare keys in the room and they were not functioning. 4th time: We booked the Orchid Suite. It was great! View was fantastic! Everything in the room was working. Yeah! 5th time: Big Boo boo. The room was not well kept. There was still a piece of stinky cheese in our fridge. They claimed to upgrade us f.o.c to a suite. because we requested for a city view grand room and they do not have any. I was really shocked, because we did the booking weeks before, how is it possible that they do not have it? weird! So they \upgrade\"" us to a suite. When we went into the so-called suite, it was super small! Smaller than the grand room! It is NOT a suite! So when we called the front office, they insist that it is a suite because it is on the 48th floor. But it is super small!!! No bedroom, no living room! very different from the orchid suite we stayed before. From previous experience, we knew that we better confirm before proceeding to the Club lounge or Sky on 57 for breakfast, so we called & confirmed that we have complimentary access. Guess what, we arrived and again we were denied on entry. They said \""you are only upgraded to a suite but you do not get to enjoy the privileges\"" Does it make sense? When you get a free upgrade from economy class to business class do they serve you economy class food? So again, after much call and waiting, they allowed us in. And then they charge us again, and then we had to clarify and then they waived the charges. Final thoughts: MBS is a beautiful hotel, Beautiful view, comfortable rooms. But their communication between department is really bad. We shouldn't have to go through so much stress waiting and clarifying stuffs. Some may wonder so if that bad why did i visit it like 5times? No choice. Points from casino cannot be spent else where. My dad loves the casino there as well. Hence the points goes to booking rooms in MBS.""",557
MBS,2,“The only nice thing was the view”,"My children had always wanted to stay at this iconic hotel so when we got the chance we were thrilled. The excitement ended when we got into the lobby. My husband, who had stayed there twice before and hated it turned to us and said, \Welcome to the marketplace\"". It really was. The lobby was noisy, unwelcoming and too much of a mess. It took us more than an hour to check in. We arrived at 2.30 and was told that we would have to wait 2 hours for our 2 rooms to be ready. As we needed to change and attend an event, they offered a public day room. By the time we organised with the concierge where to send the bags, they said one room was ready. At the check-in counter, we also witnessed how a front desk staff handled another customer. Yong Ming was busy with the computer and when a customer walked up to the desk to speak to him, he put his hand out to her face and told her to \""get back in line please as I'm busy\"". We were too stunned by his rudeness. The young woman attending to us, Rina, was completely befuddled by the whole process of checking in a guest as if it was the first time she was doing it. We had rooms numbered 13 and 15 and she insisted that they were not adjoining, despite our request, saying that there was another room in between. She didn't seem to realise that 14 was across the hallway. Not impressed at all.When we got our cards and tried to go up the lift, the cards didn't work. So we had to get out to the lobby again (!) and approach another counter officer, Shahira, who was even more rude. We couldn't believe how we continued to face such arrogance as if we were asking for a handout. So far, nobody was welcoming at all.By the time we got to the room, we were terribly disappointed at what is claimed to be a highly-starred hotel. It took a while for the staff to organise opening the connecting doors and when they eventually did so, the doors were wedged open with the bedroom slippers! You'd think the hotel would be able to afford a rubber door wedge, at least, for how much they charge per room.The pool is architecturally well designed and is the show stopper but don't bother trying to swim there. It's worse than any public lido. The most you can do is drape yourself over the infinity side of the pool.When we got back from our morning dip, the rooms had yet to be cleaned. So we left for lunch and got back at 3.45 and the rooms were still uncleaned. I asked the cleaners why and he moaned, looking stressed, \""I have so many rooms to clean!\"" Hhmm. Even then the rooms were not cleaned well. Used mugs and glasses were not cleaned.Ok, so the view is wonderful. But for S$20 you can enjoy the same view from the Sands Sky Deck. Or by having a meal or drink at Ku De Ta. You could also get similar views from some of the nearby hotels which are also high end hotels but are much more welcoming without the pushing and jostling riff raff casino crowd.""",58
MBS,3,“if one can afford...good for a single night stay”,"Just for one reason, I would prefer to give 3 stars instead of 4stars to this Hotel. And that is: Placing chargeable Drinking water bottles outside the Mini bar is bit misguiding, I am the victim of the same! otherwise for a single night stay, its a good place to experience the marvelous architecture at bit expensive rates.",149
MBS,3,“'Everything that glitters is not gold'”,"Stayed for 2 nights with friends and family.When we entered the hotel it felt like we had entered into a fairly crowded, noisy shopping mall with big open restaurants and no privacy.It was a big downer.The hotel is like a big machine and lacks soul.Check in was tiring and almost took an hour with a long queue and only 2 attendants.The rooms are a good size and clean with a spacious bathroom. The pool though offer good views but is always crowded and you can't \swim\"" but can enjoy a good dip. The service was courteous and competent but lacks warmth.I would only recommend this hotel for people who don't want to be too far away from their casino tables..otherwise i'd rather give this place a miss on my next tour to singapore.I couldn't find anything that i will remember at this forgettable stay , not even the view.""",224
MBS,3,“Ok Stay”,"I stayed here with my partner for 3 nights in May 2012, we checked in at about 6:30pm and was asked to put a 300 dollar deposit down I had only 500 singapore dollars on me and I dont have a credit card that that was kinda frustrating since I had already paid for the room but anyway after that we got asked if we wanted a smoking or non smoking room I had already requested a non smoking room but got asked again went up to our room on level 5 all night we was smelling cigarettes but because we was so tired didnt think much of it the next morning it was getting quite disgusting so we went down and complained turns out they had put us in a smoking room we got to appologys and said we would have to wait a couple of hours while they get a room ready and this was on a Sunday so we went for a walk finding out nothing was really open. We found somewhere eventually got back and we had to go get our own bags and go up to our new room. We were very disspointed in the service and the lack of appologies.Of course the skypark was an experience but now we have been cant say we will be going back,",89
MBS,3,“Overrated - once was enough.”,"A casino hotel, the rooms are very basic. Other than the view, there is nothing special about the hotel. Housekeeping did not make up the rooms until late afternoon. Noticed a used cotton bud on bathroom floor when checked in - yuck!Restaurants a marketplace at breakfast with all the people! Ku De Ta lounge was ok, again only for the view. Don't expect to have a leisurely time on the rooftop as there is high foot traffic going up there. It is quite conveniently located to the business district.",436
MBS,3,"“Great facilities, mediocre rooms, poor service.”","We enjoyed our stay here but there are a few things which didn't work so well. The rooftop pool/ restaurant / bar area is great and worth a trip in itself. Views are incredible and easy to spend time there. Also the gym is on a high floor so has great views too. The rooms were ok and a good size but nothing striking or particularly special about them. Think lots of pale cream and magnolia shades. I personally found them a bit bland and disappointing but others may like this decor. The one thing that really, really let's the hotel down is the service- bearing in mind the rates they charge this should be top notch. I won't go on about this but the staff do not seem to have received any training in customer service, if they have they do their best not to show it. To give 2 examples we had booked a club room which had separate dedicated checkin. On arrival we asked where this checkin area was and were told to join the main queue. After checking in we walked past the club checkin area which was further on down the hall, we pointed this out and were met with total indifference. On checkout we went to the club checkout area where approx 10 people were waiting to checkout, served by 2 staff doing the checking out and one person floating around asking guests if they were ok. I asked if this member of staff could hop on a computer and help get rid of the queue and but told that was impossible and that I might like to use the main checkout area instead. I assumed they were being helpful rather than offhand so asked whether there was a shorter queue at the main checkin and was told that I should go and have a look to find out. The two areas are a fair walk apart so I did not want to do this with bags etc. I asked if they could just call across and find out but was told there was no way this could happen. Not the attitude you expect from a hotel claiming to be Singapores best. There were other issues, room keys didn't work, bar service was slow, long wait for taxis. It is also worth mentioning that I have written to the hotel to raise thes issues but have not yet had a response. Overall I would say that staying here is fine as long as you don't have too much need to interact with the staff. I probably wouldn't stay here again.",398
MBS,3,“A Disappointing Experience.”,"MBS is a hard hotel to review. The hotel rooms are immaculate, the facilities are immaculate, the Skypool is incredible, the staff are extremely helpful and it would get a 5/5 if you looked at these things in isolation.But the thing about MBS is you have to pay top dollar to stay there, so you have to account for your overall experience. And unfortunately, my experience with MBS was not a particularly pleasant one.Despite confirming my booking of a “Premier Room” (the second cheapest room option) more than 3 weeks prior, upon my arrival at 3pm, I was granted with a “sorry we have no more of those rooms available, please accept a downgrade”.That’s right. Through no fault of my own, I was forced to accept a complimentary DOWNGRADE to the worst type of room. Now in my experience, when hotels overbook a particular type of room, they apologised and offered me a complimentary UPGRADE instead of a downgrade. I did politely point this out to them, but this was just met with more apologies the inevitable downgrade, so I guess that’s just how it is at MBS.Unfortunately, the room key they handed me did not work, and it took the concierge and I going to back and forth from the room and lobby three times before the issue was rectified. Which usually wouldn’t be an issue for me, except I had a torn ACL (knee injury) at the time. Not pleasant to walk on at all.So no, MBS and I did not get off to the greatest start and it was unfortunate I only got to spend one night there because this is the experience I took away from it.It is especially unfortunate because the potential that MBS had for me to have an exhilarating time was clear to see. The SkyPool is something you don’t see anywhere else in the world, the shopping mall is huge and the Chocolate Buffet… well, it’s a chocolate buffet. If I wasn’t stung from the forced downgrading and the room key fiasco, MBS would’ve been a 5/5 experience.But alas, I can only review what was presented to me and it’s a real shame. I would LOVE to return and get the MBS experience I suspect most other people on TripAdvisor enjoy, but regrettably the expensive pricing makes this more of a pipedream than a reality for a traveller like me.",1861
MBS,1,“An unfair 1 on 5 -- BUT: DON'T GO THERE”,"OK, I agree, the rating of 1 on 5 is unfair, but I want you to realize that this hotel is NOT to be recommended for a stay -- full stop. So if you want the short story, DON'T consider it, no matter the promotional offers they recently dump on the general public.If you are interested in a little more detailed review, here are the plusses and minuses and I'm scratching my head, why I went to the hotel in the first place:OK, the plus: The view from the roof garden with pool is magnificent, that is if you can catch it.Others ... well I didn't say plus(ses)... oh may be one more: Take a shot of yourself from just opposite Fullerton hotel with the MBS in the background, that gets you far away enough from the long list of things which is to follow now, and you still eternalize the undoubtebly daring, if not beautiful exterior architecture of the place.Now here comes the more important list:- There is a very luxurious shopping arcade attached to the hotel, but the hotel itself has the feel of a 1990's shopping center itself- The staff is completely clueless (and that's putting it mildly) ... if you don't want to believe, try it for yourself without styaing there, you will not regret you did the test before.- The rooms are banale ... and I mean, banale as in plain vanilla normal, nothing justifying the hype that is made- The place is just tooo big. That combined with the dreadful lack of staff professionalism really really makes me think of Cheap&Cheerful Las Vegas hotels (oh yeah ... the Sands), ... It's not a luxury hotel, it's not a resort, it's just unpractical association of three towers. and would you believe it, there is actually 7 floors not only on the \wrong side\"" of the building, but not even accessible without crossing the shopping mall lobby ... imagine doing that with a bathrobe on your way to the rooftop.Now here is the fineprint of my complete rant: Was in singapore for 2 nights, and absolutely wanted to see the place. So I decided to change hotels and spend the second nite at the MBS. Otherwise a platinum/dimaond/ambassador on what not member in major chains, this was a difficult decision to take, but I WANTED to swim above Singapore. Online offered rate was SGD 375++, but not bookable, due to a minimum stay requirement. So I called and was offered a rate of SGD 319++ for a one night stay ... Wonder why? I did, but understood later. The \""maximum chaos\"" or \""entropy\"" principle seems to be the only subject taught at MBS' YMCA-like staff training course...OK, I went there for the view ... but since I had to change hotels and a full business day of work, .I sort of had to rush to make it. As so often, no taxi available in Singapore CBD at close of business, I finally jumped into the MRT with my trolley & briefcase. It's a little cumbersome, since you have to change to the extension of the circle line, but eventually gets you there in Singapore efficiency kind of way. I stepped out the MRT at 6:20 in full daylight, walked through the impressive shoppes arcade and arrived in the middle of a huge -- yeah let's call it corridor, with no visible indications what so ever, on where to check-in, but hordes (and I mean hordes as in several hundred at a time) of tourists walking up and down, taking photos, shouting at you, if you cross their aiming line ... and what not. Since I was in the hotel proper, I asked about \""Check-in\"". The first guy didn't know, since he was new (I mean ... he didnt know where the check in desk was ????). The second guy, asked me in which tower I had booked my room, which I didn't know. So finally I made my way to where I believe most of the tourists came from, somewhere near the entrance door, where even more of them where gathering to take photos of 1990's style modern art sculptures, on which you could sit.Near the entry, a huge desk, with barely anybody waiting which turned out to be concierge, and an opposite one with 4 check-in clerks working and a huge (and I mean as in Singapore taxi queue huge) line of people waiting to check-in, easily distinguishable from the other hord as featuring luggage in lieu of camera. So we are all patiently waited in line and I was getting worried on the daylight quality of my shots from the rooftop, it must have been around 6:40. I'll spare you the details on the wait, but clearly all 4 check-in clerks had gotten a 20/20 mark in the entropy course, all of them continuously fumbling on the other clerk's computer, phone every time to check whether the room was \""clean\"" and explaining that you can't get to the pool, if you don't have your keycard and that the internet password is your room number plus the first three letters of your surname and telling everybody about the restaurant options (there are many!!!) When it was turn, the sun had started to set. My credit pre-authorization slip shows 7:07pm. The lady gave me an upgrade to a soandso suite, so she said -- a very nice room as she promised. 267, well I thought floor 26 on 57 was good enough for the view...I fought off the bellboy so I could rush to the room, dump the luggage and rush up to the roof terrace to do what I came for, daylight was dwindling very fast. I went to the lifts in Tower (so I had been told), some where the disneyland-yellow-mega-mushroom-like huts of the \""Chinese gourmet restaurant\"" jack in the middle of the shopping center style lobby. please remember we are talking distances here, like a 5 minutes walk or something like that. I passed my card and wanted to press 26, but it didn't work... Here an employee was at hand and I was told, I was actually not on floor 26, but on floor 2 (ok, I should have guessed from the 3 digit room number)... here went my view from the room. I also had to take a different lift to \""our cheaper rooms\"", said the liftboy (so much for the upgrade)... OK I went there, the lift was just opposite, near the toilets. I went up to my level 2 and was eager to get going to the rooftop afterwards.Red light at the door, the key card doesn't work; can happen and not a problem in a regular size hotel, you just go back to reception desk and here you are. Not here, 6 mins walk, (and 20 mins queueing ...), I called from the courtesy phone. You are on hold for 3 minutes, then get asked all kinds of security questions and finally \""what can I help you with today?\"" Key card not working. We'll send somebody. OK. Of course, nobody came. Second call, same customer service representative (mind you), security questions once again. \""Oh good evening Mr xxxx, we just spoke, the person is already on its way with your key.\"" Another 10 mins past, hesitating to jogg back to the lobby without my luggage, but can't leave it in the middle of the shopping center. so a third call, another person, more security questions (including: which room are you calling from, so we can call you back). The sun had set, so it didn't matter too much anymore, but I was starting to attract strange regards from all the staff which went to the restroom just below where I was standing to wait for my key. Well, the third call did wonders, probably because I had insisted to speak to the FO manager now. At 7:42pm I was let into my room, so 1h22min from MRT to my room ... and no, it was in the same building complex!I went up to the roof terrace and took a couple of night shots, which are still nice, but even after 8pm, this place is crowded, you wouldn't believe it. They control the room key with a slow key card reader and a guy standing next to it, one swipe per person (not per room)... and the guy get into an arguments with every third person or so ... so imagine the wait, once again. My replacement key card did NOT work neither (I hadn't realized, as somebody else had badged in the elevator), so I was not allowed into the pool area, although being a hotelguest and i really didn't want to argue yet another time. But, nothing much to say against the roof top terrace at nite. I decided to come back for sunrise and had come over the fact that I had changed hotels basically for nothing, because coming up here would have been easier, without staying at the hotel.I went back to my room, a huge room indeed, but not a suite, just an awkwardly arranged huge room, with some patio style sofas in the middle of it and two huge flat screen TV's, one too far away from the bed to be able to watch it and the second one in a static 90degree angle from it. Well I didn't come to watch TV, I had a terrace, with a 'seaside view'... well I was on level 2 and looked out on a 4 lane highway where cars were driving at highway speed. The noise was horrible and closing the windows barely helped.The FO called and was apologetic about the service difficulties, 'you say you have experienced' (I say?). Then i was told, I probably exagerated a little bit, by saying I had to wait 15 minutes before the key arrived, because she checked the time of my call and when the door was opened and it was only 12 minutes in between... so I shouldn't be too unhappy. I thought a minute about explaining that there had been 2 other calls before and, after all a check in agent, , but thought better of it.... Anyway, despite this \""being only a small service disruption\"" I was offered breakfast for compensation.No ... don't dream, at check-out the guy, of course, wanted to charge me for breakfast because I had taken it at the wrong restaurant and was starting to argue with me, \""Mr XXX I insist, all our customers have to pay their bills. Your breakfast is 47 SGD... \"" and yes \""it would have been the same price at the correct restaurant\""Another call to the FO manager (of course a different one) solved the issue. \""I hope you had a nice stay, Mr XXX, is there anything else we can do for you?\""Well, you really made a difference and, no, not only do I not take the risk to ask you where the taxi queue is, you won't get the privilege to serve me again ...After all 1/5 is not sooo unfair for spoiling my daylight shot of the Singapore skyline at 319 SGD++""",100
MBS,3,“It could be so much better!”,"Fantastic location and great building. The rest is hit and miss. Good rooms and suites, fantastic facilities for club members, drinks and nibbles in the afternoon really good and breakfast on the 57th floor quite special (although repetitive if you stay more than one day as they do not change it). House-keeping not at the level of the hotel, turn down service no existent (even for the suite). Reception desk average, nice but inefficient. Buffet dinner quite average and location uninspiring. Having said that, you need to stay at least once to enjoy the fantastic pool on the top floor!",200
MBS,3,“The pool is the only reason...”,"Marina Sands Bay Hotel is a tourist attraction - no doubt about it. And yes, its a majestic building offering splendid views of Singapore. The Sky Deck with the infinity pool is unique - that I fully agree. But that is about it.....The hotel is huge monster, with hundreds of people in the corridors, main area, elevators, swimming pool, simply everywhere. And we have stayed on Monday and before the main summer break. The reservation service was not at its best. I had couple of back and forths regarding my reservation. Be careful about \free \"" upgrades. We reserved a deluxe room in Tower 3 and were upgraded for a suite. Well, suite is a nice thing to have, but not facing the 8-line highway and not on a third floor, when the hotel has 50 floors and one of the reasons you book in, is to have a view. The hotel is on a secluded location so if you want to see anything, you need to take a subway and change at least once. I enjoyed the 1-night stay because of the pool and I'm glad we stayed there - for one time only and for one night only.""",137
MBS,3,"“Definitely worth a stay, just for the pool”","The infinity pool on the 57th floor, the shopping mall, the hotel lobby and the gigantic artwork, the people milling around, the nighttime view of the hotel, all worth 1~2 night stay, but I don't think I would stay again. You can always visit the hotel without staying and still do everything!I especially liked the hospitality suites that were given, because we had a late flight, and had to check out at 2pm, we showered at the hospitality suites.One thing that the management must address. THE CARD KEYS DO NOT WORK!!!! It was not just me, but EVERY guest I saw had the same problem. At no time did the cards work on the first try. Even the staff had trouble opening the doors. PLEASE FIX THIS ANNOYING PROBLEM, it does not suit this magnificent looking hotel.",137
MBS,3,“Good for a 1 night stay but overpriced”,"All in all, we would recommend staying only one night at Marina Bay Sands, in order to experience the Sky Park. The hotel public areas have no ambience, and there are so many guest rooms that the service was well below what we expect for a 5* hotel in Singapore. At the price the hotel charges, service should be more personal. In a destination such as Singapore, hotels should be able to cope with guests arriving round the clock and this was not the case here. After you have tried Marina Bay Sands we strongly recommend staying in the Grand Hyatt Singapore. Although the food offering in the club lounge is more limited, you will find the service vastly superior and the rooms are furnished to a much higher level. For full review including pictures see: http://www.driven2travel.co.uk/marina-bay-sands---club-room.html",207
MBS,3,“A one time experience stay.”,"Upon arrival at Changi airport, we took the free shuttle bus to the hotel. The hotel lobby is too crowded. Check-in was fast as we had filled the pre-arrival form via the Internet however it was rather slow for normal chech-in. Stayed on the 14th floor, corridors leading to the room is hot. It is a rather tedious process going to the skypark and pool area as you would to change 2 lifts, but not so if you are staying on the 22nd floor and above. the pool area itself is great, good view of the city, however the water is rather dirty and sometimes over crowded. There are plenty of high end restaurants and local food stall, however they are too expensive compared to food sold in Orchard Road Ion and etc.... Apart from the size and the pool, there is really nothing special about the hotel. It is just another hotel with overpriced stuffs. For those who wants to go shopping staying in Orchard is a much better choice. It is not as grand a hotel and casino as that is the US. With that staying there once for the experience is enough, well unless you like to gamble then this is the perfect hotel.",117
MBS,3,"“Iconic Hotel, too much tourists making people feel uncomfortable.”","It's one of the most Iconic hotel in the World, and now the symbol of luxurious accommodation in the Island of Singapore. It might be hyped, but this place is extremely overrated. Too much tourists in the lobby taking photos and going in and out to the malls. It does not have that homey feel. Staff is very slow and lacking in their hospitality/charm. The pool on the Skydeck is nice, but it is packed with tourists and kids during the day. On top of that, there are visitors of the skydeck who are constantly staring at the pool guests, making people feel uncomfortable. Best thing; The infinity pool up in the Skypark, the view is breathtaking!!",313
MBS,3,“Service not up to expectation!”,"Booked a Grand Room for 2nights in June, and due to my bro in law is a member of MBS club, get a free upgrade to Orchid Suite. Reached there around 2pm, has to wait til 530pm to check in as suite is not ready, house-keeping dept was short-handed I supposed. Given instruction for them to call us once its ready while we were given access card to Sky Park, and they have actually forgotten about it untill we went back to reception to ask. We could have checked in earlier should they remember to inform us. Reached room, their manager called us as we have written a complaint email to MBS while checking in. Guess what, the manager did not check or read our complain email and find out the details before calling us. He has to keep pausing and requesting us to hold on while hes trying to digest the email and info. So much about their professionalism in customer handling... What a let down on the 1st impression... The only thing they can recover the lapse of service is to offer a $100 F & B vouchers to us and a late check out at 4pm.. Voucher will cover an adult and 2kids' breakfast for one day!As for the room decor, I expect a more classy and cosy concept, but alas it was just ok to me. View is great thou, city view at a glance! Bathtub is appealing, spacious shower room, partition on living room and bedroom, at 97 metre square, its as big as a 4room flat in sengkang. Great location as its in downtown area. Tidy and neat, can be more cosy if they have chosen a lighter and sweet room wall colour. For that kind of price paid, I would say that expectation did not meet and room for improvement in both service level and handling.",115
MBS,1,“Nightmare!!!!”,"Knowing that this is a 5 star hotel, the service is really lousy. It is better to stay in Fragrance Hotel, the service is a lot better. I really don't know how this hotel became a 5 star.Checking in, it took me almost 3 hours for the check in. For the baggage, it took them another hour for that bags to be delivered in our room.Room: the worst room of a 5 star hotel. All the furnitures are laminated wood, no bathtub.The restaurants are always full. I was trying to reserve, but the reservation should be made at least 1 month advance!!!!I will never recommend and return to this lousy hotel.Over rated, over charging hotel!!!!",196
MBS,3,“Spectacular and annoying!”,"The designers of this hotel have gone to great lengths to impress the public, and this hotel does just that! It's very impressive and the crowning glory is the top floors and spectacular pool areas. But...!! the lifts won't read the room cards and taking a lift trip is an exercise in frustration. By the time your card is accepted you are miles away in the opposite direction. The rooms are large and beds comfortable but the showers are so hi tech you need your glasses to read the instructions to operate. This hotel must have the MEANIST bar fridge in all Asia. Just move one item in the jam packed frig and it is automatically charged to your room! The frig is so loaded with stuff you don't want and can't move, there is no room for personal medication or water bottles.Breakfast is a whopping $40 per person and the foyer is so packed with traffic it's like a department store at sale time! All I want , is to be treated like a guest and not a Credit Card on legs. All around this is an annoying hotel! Take a peek, but stay elsewhere!",224
MBS,3,“Premier Room vs Deluxe Room”,"We stayed at MBS on 3 occasions. 1st stay in Nov 2010 (Premier Room), 2nd time in Sep 2011 during F1 race (Deluxe Room) and most recent in Apr 2012 (Premier Room). The Premier Rooms are spacious and luxurious, with a free-standing bathtub and separate toilet and shower rooms. These rooms face Singapore's Central Business District and the skyscapers set the backdrop of the view. The night scene is spectacular.On the other hand, the Deluxe room is much smaller and nothing different from a regular good 4-star hotel. The room we stayed in Sep 2011 faced the sea. However, with Singapore's sea dotted with tankers and ships and the Gardens by the Bay still under construction then, the view was nothing to shout about. The shower knob was not in good working order. Given that it was barely 1.5 years since its opening, the experience was disappointing . In addition, the Deluxe Room we stayed in was slightly dirty, with ink stains on the table and small pieces of trash along the edges of the floor. MBS definitely should step up on its housekeeping. In comparison, our experiences in the Premier Room far exceeded that in the Deluxe Room. For those considering a stay in MBS, if the price difference is not too significant, I would recommend spending more for the Premier Room experience.",744
MBS,1,“The worst 5 star hotel in Singapore”,"I'm a Singaporean and I bring my family for hotel staycation regularly. I must say that Marina Bay Sands Hotel is the worst experience I had. And I must say that it is a disgrace to the country.I reached the hotel at 2.45 hrs and waited at the VIP lounge until 3.30 pm for me turn. There were not many people in front of me in the queue but the checking in process was just horrendously long. The receptionist took about 20 min per customer. That was not the worst. I was told that my room was not ready (even when the checking in time was supposed to be 3 pm) and it would only be ready after 1.5 hours. The receptionist then offered to give me a guest room while I wait. I appreciated that as we were carrying a few bags and I have a 10 month old infant with me. To my horror, the guest room was a shared room and there were 6 persons inside. There were no enough sofas for us all to sit hence I had to go to the balcony. There was also a Thai man who was sick, lying on a sofa. I really pity him as he was there before we came in. At 4.30 pm, I could not wait any more and I went back to the reception to ask for my room. To my horror (again), the receptionist asked me to queue all over again (which meant another 45 mins of waiting)! I refused to as I told him that I had already he checked in, I merely wanted to get my room keys. He grudgingly served me and gave me the keys.We then walked all over the hotel to find our room. There was nobody to direct us. The receptionist also did not show us the direction when I collected my keys. When i asked a lady for direction, she pointed in some general direction which led us to the wrong tower, carrying all our bags and my baby girl. It took us 20 min to get to the right room.We finally reached our suite at 5 pm. And the sick Thai man was still in the guest room waiting for his room to be ready. When I reached the suite, it was a huge disappointment. The room was plain for a five star hotel. The room was also not properly cleaned. There were rubber bands and bits of papers on the floor. The carpet near the washroom was also damp. The worst was, there was no capsules for coffee maker! So I called room service to ask for a full set of capsules. A Chinese-national came with three capsules, did not say a word and left. A full set should have 6 capsules. I am not picky with the number of capsules but the service was just too terrible especially when I was staying in a suite and that was supposed to be VIP priority service! So I called room service again to ask for a full set, the lady over the phone said \I have told them to send the capsules to you already\"". I said a man did gave me the capsules but I expected a full set. She started to sound unhappy and said she would ask the man to deliver to me again in a sarcastic tone. When the (same) man came, I showed him the empty box and I said (in english) that I want a full set, he replied in Chinese \""that is not my responsibility, I only deliver goods\"" and walked away. The was TERRIBLE! At 7 pm, we realised that the receptionist did not give us the document stating our privileges so we went down to ask for it only to realize that we were entitled to a complimentary tea and also cocktail which we both missed. I made a complain at 8 pm and the manager compensated us with $100 worth of in-room dining.All in all, it was a terrible experience and I will never go back there again. My experience at Fairmount, M Hotel, Amara Sanctuary Resort, Oriental Hotel etc. are much much better.What really put me off was the terrible service. The hotel used too many Chinese-nationals who were rude and they do not speak English. I have nothing again the Chinese-nationals in general but the ones I had contact with in MBS were just not up to the job.""",408
MBS,2,“1 star quality staff... more like B&B service with upset staff”,Need to wait till 3pm to check in.They claimed to give me a free upgrade - to 5th floor.Club rooms are meant to be high floor and they gave me a suite on 5th floor. 3rd building on the other side of the complex. When i got to the room 523 it was a normal standard room. small room and worse thing it was still unmade. i was forced to walk all the way back to reception(tower 1) and after my complaint about getting a standard low level room she some how came up with a club room which i ordered and which she said there was no more club rooms before.I was discusted to hear this as i was lied to twice before i settled in.After i got in the room was as i wanted it to be even though i expected it to be on a higher floor after spending over $900 for it.On check out i asked for the manager who i spoke to . He listened and claimed i was lying as the computer said i was meant to get room 525. I said this is impossible as i was told 523 and 523 was written on the card .I said i want to make him aware of the problems with his staff and he just smiled. i said lets just leave it there and check me out. The manager walked off and started serving another customer who does not even seem to need any help. I waited there for 10 mins before asking a member of staff on the next counter to check if he is checking me out. He obviously wasnt and adding to the poor teams customer service experience. I guess this is what you would expect from a rip off dont care team.He finished chatting to the customer before coming back to check me out. Normal customer service would be dealing first come first serve. He obviously does not have that skill to be customer service or even a manager.It took another 5 mins to check out and give me the deposit back. This poor so called manager is called Yong Ming.As i left the table i asked another staff member for a person higher than him as i was furious with the service. He called over the Front Office Manager who said he will deal with it.. i still have not heard from him till today. 1 week ago.,242
MBS,3,“do it once for the experience...”,"Fantastic rooms with top notch free WiFi, however many annoying things:1. check-in: even tough I used their online pre-check-in and then again used their on-shuttle-bus check-in, it took ages to get the room key. A big queue formed behind me when the check-in staff (at the 'express' check-in) registered my details (I thought I pre-registered and pre-checked in twice; online and on the shuttle bus?). He was typing so much he must have written a short novel! It took forever - very disappointing. The lobby is one big train station with hundreds of people queueing everywhere.2. stayed in a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor and the whole floor as well as the room stank from cigarette smoke. I could not bother too complain and change the room as I did not want to go through the whole check-in procedures (I only stayed one night).3. you cannot use the fridge unless you buy from the hotel - as soon as you pick-up anything you will get charged (even if you put it back again). It is electronically registered which means you cannot buy anything from outside and place it into your fridge.4. Sky Pool: amazing experience but still very disappointing: too crowded and too many visitors walking around. Difficult to get a lounger. Pool food was good though.5. Location: there is nothing besides the hotel (and all its facilities, shops, etc.)Try it once for the experience. I doubt they have many regulars.",211
MBS,2,“Stay 1 time so you can go the pool.”,"A trip to the rooftop pool is a Singapore \must do\"". The rest of the place looks impressive on arrival but ends up being very ordinary. Get ready to queue up a lot - to check in, to get breakfast, to get a taxi, to get a car out of parking, to check out. This place must have a couple of thousand rooms and it feels like it. The lobby area can be like grand central station most of the time. Security is quite lax. Room cards are used in the lift but seem to give access to all floors. So you can expect to share a lift with either the odd Russian hooker who has nipped into the lift with you, or with a someone struggling to get the lift system to work. Insist on a seaward room - they generally have a balcony and feel bigger. The city facing rooms feel smaller and dont have balconies - they feel like they are meant to be complimentary rooms for gamblers that won't really use them. Its the sort of place you go to once by choice simply to say you've been and thereafter only to attend conferences. Otherwise there are lots of nicer and more convenient hotels to choose from.""",85
MBS,3,“A 'Nice' hotel - but very touristy”,"This hotel is well located, intriguing architecture, sensational swimming pool, but too full of people looking up through their cell phones taking pictures - and thus always running into others. There is very little space to sit down through the entire first floor of the hotel, and this detracts fro the experience. Rooms are fine, with great view of either the city or the straits, especially from the higher rooms.Probably a 'must see' once, but after that, there are other more relaxing hotels in Singapore.",138
MBS,3,“lovely rooms but lost in the ocean”,"We went there for a friends birthday in 2011 and also to go to an Eagles concert (not at the hotel)...The rooms are extremely clean, neat, staff is polite courteous and prompt.. the breakfast spread is sumptious the rooftop swimming pool exceeds everything thats been said about it..but for a hotel buff like me, the sheer hugeness of the place makes you feel lost. the check in area is a like a airport. When we went there were no couches or lounge chairs, so each guest had to wait in an enormous queue with their baggage either to check in or check out..at anypoint of time there is a sea on humanity walking up and down the mammoth corridors as you're having a drink or eating lunch or breakfast..not a place for someone looking for a hotel experience..",99

We have already booked the room which can check-in at separate floor.

I am not sure if there are improvement from this hotel since I was travelled there last year.",110
MBS,3,"“Excellent view, service could be better”","No need to describe the rooms and the views - they are outstanding. But we had not so great experience with hotel service. First, we've been checking in for 1,5 hour (!) - there was a big non-organized queue. Second, administrator wanted 400$ to be deposited, but the room was pre-paid 2 month ago. Third, no one said that we got not the room we booked: not cityview but seaview. Ok, maybe that room was really better, but it was on the 13th floor, and nothing interesting was in the window. So it took another 30 minutes to enter the room we booked. Sorry guys, the first impression was spoiled.",513
MBS,2,“Last year was worst now they move to poor”,"I stayed at Marine Bay Sands during 6-13 May 2012 in the grand room tower 3, the room is nice better than club room which i stayed last year but you will miss a chance to eat untasty afternoon tea at club lounge next to swimming pool. Anyway, this time hotel staff had an improvements in terms of english communications but always room for improvements comparing with neighbour conrad hotel in singapore in can give them only from worst to poor.Lists below is my view during stay.- Hotel ReservationAvaliability of room in Early booking and normal booking are different so i missed a chance to stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel from 13-20 May 2012 because it stated in early booking that 13-20 may was fully booked then i booked with another hotel but when i checked again at normal rate, it shows a room for book.- Front Desk / Reception - CHECK INNot friendly, Not helpful, they not look for people who is waiting next queue, they look for another people in the line but not on the queue. Very long queue, have to wait around 40 mintues and not get the room immediately have to wait 3 hours to get the room and spent another 25 mintues to queue. In total, i waited in the queue 1.05 Hrs. no one advice me i can use the fast check in the next 20m counter which i already online check-in- Check outi tried to check out online in the hotel TV, found usage of minibar 3 times which i didnot touch or open at all, so i call to front for services, he not get it, ok, i missed a chance to online check out, never mind go back and queue again, Spent 10 mintues for check out, explain the bill includes minibar which i didnot use, explain 1 time, not get, explain 2 time still not and the last time was 3, he got it.- Housekeepingthe housekeeper sent the service card in the early morning everyday (8.00-10.00), so we need to call them for services everyday and after the calls, i have to wait at least 2-3 hrs before they clean the room and it not that clean.- Priority servicesI used the service almost everyday, two days are good but the rest are poor, Asked for milk for the coffe machine, they gave me cofee-maid, Asked for ice, they gave me nothing. Asked for laundry, they said already delivered but nothing in my closet, call twice, noting happen, waited for 3 hours then i got laundry without feedback.- Room conditionsEverytime i open the light, the curtain will open automatically, sample for one night, it was a stormy and rainy day, the light shut down more than 5 times and everytime i have to wake up and close the curtain which not include opened the light to read some book, talk to my wife, go to restroom, i have to walk and shut all the curtain again and again.All in all, they have an improvements but not get a true quality of servcies.",562
MBS,3,“Fab....But!!”,"Spent 4 nights at The Marina Bay Sands a couple of weeks ago as the first stop on our Honeymoon (stayed Monday to Friday). We arrived early morning 8.30am ish. We were able to check in straight away. This is only due the the receptionist demanding 400 dollars off us as security for the room (We had not accounted for this!). We were held to ransom as we were told if we didn't pay it we couldn't check in! I just got a little bit upset as our wedding guest had given us money to spend on our honeymoon I hadn't accounted for it being used for this purpose plus the fact of lack of sleep and a 14 hour flight! Think the receptionist felt a bit sorry for me - hence early check in. We paid the 400 dollars in cash as we were told we would the cash back when we checked out - if paying by card it could take up to 2 weeks to get the money back - BEWARE! We were later told by another receptionist a couple of days later that this payment is optional - confused! When you check-in double and triple check everything on your booking. On day 2 of our stay at breakfast my husband signed for breakfast and then a couple of minutes later the lady came back and said could we pay for it by credit card - after explaining that we were on B & B basis we went off to reception with all out paperwork from our agent confirming this but the hotel said we were on room only and then we were told that apparently our agent hadn't paid them for the room either. Couple of phones call later to our agent in the UK everthing did get cleared up and the breakfast charges were removed. Never saw any big queues for check in either - I think tower 1 check-in is the busiest as that's where most taxi's drop off but I am sure you can check-in at other towers. Our room was on the 45th floor with a sea view and our luggage was delivered within 10 minutes. No issues with the room is was lovely - the bed and pillows are very comfy.Never had to wait more than a few seconds for a lift. The pool was just wow - the photo's and video's just don't do it justice you just have to expierence it in real life. We didn't really eat in the hotel excepf for fries around the pool and I did order a chicken club sandwich from room service which was really nice. Location is great, a nice leisurly walk around marina bay took us about 1 1/2 hours (Stopping off at the F1 track and the Merlion). We also walked to Clarke Quay a couple of times (only because i had flat shoe's on wouldn't of been able to do it of wearing heels). I had seen other reviews saying the hotel wasn't very intimate - this did not bother us as we in Singapore to see Singapore and we were on our honeymoon so we were not really bothered about trying to make friends. I did look round the shoppes but didn't purchase - nice to window shop though.  Except for the mix-ups with reception we did like this hotel.",279
MBS,3,“IMPERSONAL One night if only to swim in the Skypark”,"We had a great week in Singapore staying one night at the Marina Bay Sands. Checkin and navigating this goliath of a resort is a nightmare and staff are not very helpful or understanding.We chose a more expensive Club Room, yet the checkin staff made us feel no extra level of service for the extra price. Service overall was really poor and impersonal, given the size of the resort I guess we should have expected this. You are really just a room number.The room was clean and well maintained. View was the back of the hotel, classed as an 'ocean view' yet not much to look at. Would recommended asking for city view, this is probably extra though.The shopping complex is massive and can take ages to walk around if you dont know where you want to go. Not really a place for a leisurely wander.As a Club Room guest we enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea, which were both great quality and good service. The staff in the restaurant are far more attentive than in the hotel itself.Our main reason for staying at the hotel was to use the Skypark and infinity pool. Oh yes! This really is the hotels best, if not only feature. Solely for the use of guests, for once in our stay we felt valued as guests given the exclusivity of using the pool. A night at the hotel is definately worth it just for the use of the pool. The views across Singapore are amazing and the photos you see are exactly what you get.Overall, great stay to use the pool, otherwise overpriced for the service offered, for longer stays look elsewhere in Singapore.",209
MBS,2,“All that glitters is not gold”,"I stayed here because it looked like such an amazing building and set to become a new icon of Singapore. My expectations were raised again when I walked into the lobby as it was really impressive but things went downhill as I hit the check in desk. It took 20 minutes to check in (I also looked at other people checking in and they all seemed to spend 15 minutes), that feels really long after 20 hours of travel.The room was nothing more than basic. It would be good for a three star level hotel but dissapointing for a four star never mind a five star hotel. Very noisy also.Breakfast was hugely overpriced and one of the worst hotel breakfasts I've had. The basic problem is that there are just way too many people for the staff to provide the service required of a five star hotel. Overall this is the most disspointing hotel I've stayed in for years. Stay away and sve your money. You should go up to the roof bar Ku De Ta for a drink as the view is stunning but you don't need to stay in the hotel to do this...the cover charge of SGD$30 is worht avoiding having to stay in the hotel.",215
MBS,3,“Only go for the pool”,"We were excited to see this hotel and especially the pool, which we had seen in pictures. From the moment we arrived, it felt more like a 'disneyworld' attraction than a 5* hotel experience. This hotel is so large and houses so many tourists from all over the world that you feel like a number. The room was very large, and the floor to ceiling windows offer a spectacular view. However, there is no design in the room and very little furniture, so it is just a large empty room. The furniture is already worn, even though this is a relatively new hotel. The bathroom is nice and large with a large walk-in shower, but come on - where are the hooks? Where am I supposed to hang my towel and wet bathing suit? The pool is spectacular and perhaps? worth the price of the stay, since the public observation deck does not include the pool area. However, if I go back to Singapore, I will not stay here. There are much nicer hotels (Mandarine Oriental or Fullerton) that are actually cheaper, though they don't offer that crazy pool suspended in the sky. I was honestly shocked to see that MBS is a 5* hotel, because this is in no way a 5* hotel experience.",142
MBS,1,“Tacky and soulless”,"With 20 % of the reviews labelled \poor\"" or \""terrible\"", you know what to expect. MBS is as good as the lobby of a railway station with high-flying hookers as a perk. Service is inexistent; have to queue-up 30' before being seated for breakfast (good luck with your kids); your are charged for every single extra and the only worthwhile entertainment (the 120 meter-long infinity pool on the sky-deck with amazing view) is assaulted by a noisy crowd from early morning with virtually no chance to get a long chair. All that for a minimum of 250 EUR or 300 USD/night. Overall, it's as tacky, tasteless and soulless place pretending to be upscale but good enough for nouveau-riches or a one night try-out if you want to impress your girlfriend - whom you can dump the day after if she is impressed.""",40

MBS,3,“Trying to be a resort when it's just a casino”,"Busy check-in, long lines with half the check-in desks unmanned and lots of other staff standing around smiling but not helping. Room was good, clean and in reasonable condition. Some wear on the furniture despite this being a relatively new hotel. Had room service a couple of times and this was reasonable and fast. Noise from road outside was a little more than in other hotesl in Singapore. Breakfast buffet was a disaster! Quick to get a table followed by a very long slow moving line on the \hot western\"" buffet. Poorly organised and slow, food was cold. I decided it wasn't for me and told wait staff that I would not be paying for it as I left. Long line to check-out and was offerered \""express check-out\"" with my bill to follow by email. Several days later no email! Overall the architecture is about the best thing about the hotel. Considering the price of the rooms the service levels are pretty poor, the public areas noisy and crowded despite being quite a way from the casino and shops. If you want gambling and expensive shops in a hotel then this is the place to stay. If not then there are a lot better for the price and a lot closer to other attractions, transport and food.""",85

MBS,3,“infinity pool on the 57th floor”,"A tale of one hotel and two levels of service. Checkin staff was very efficient as were the bell hops. Staff was friendly, greeted me in the hallways and were generally very courteous...until i really needed attention.I checked in at 1 am to a beautiful room overlooking the city on the 46th floor....with an unexplained wet carpet in the corner. It took 15 minutes for someone to take a look at it and even then they just sent someone from housekeeping who didn't English with a small towel to mop it up. I called the operator again and asked them to change rooms.... supposedly they were sold out and could only put me on the 6th floor in a suite (I was on the 47th floor). I complained that I wanted something comparable or better, then they offered to send me a technician. Mind you, by then it was 2am and I was in no mood to have a technician fix any problem. I just wanted to crawl into bed. I had a wet corner in the room all weekend, but they offered me free breakfast so I guess that was their compromise. The next afternoon, though, the front desk called me to offer a different room. By then I got over the wet carpet, which was in an unused corner of the room and I didn't feel like repacking/unpacking anyway.The hotel is over-run with tourists and day visitors on weekends. The skypark pool was a mad house day and night. The pool bar wouldn't take my order shortly after 10pm (even though they were supposed to stay open to 11pm), then sent me to the club bar next door, who would not serve me because i wanted a drink poolside (they only had glass cups), and would not serve me in the club bar because I was in a bathing suit (hello, I told you I just wanted a drink by the pool, right?). I offered to walk over to the bar next door for a plastic cup (same company, same floor, same hotel), when magically the pool bar decided to let me purchase a drink. So, I guess I have to conclude that the service was spotty. The hotel is probably just too too big, and cater to mass market and tours. My room service breakfast, by the way, was cold by the time it got to me.I'm glad I stayed here.. the skypark inifinity pool was incredible. Now that I've been there, done that... next time I'll choose a different hotel.",123
MBS,3,“nice roof”,"If you like a huge and impersonal hotels, then Marina Bay Sands is for you. Marina Bay Sands - is built in a completly new area little bit out of the city centre, but Marina Bay is a very modern and new part with own life.What is very impressive is the roof - you may not be a hotel guest and you can visit the roof.Hotel room are nice, but for me nothing special. Room was clean, bed was good. As the hotel is so huge everything take a many time (room service, elevator). The prices are without tax and service charge! Dinner in a hotel restaurant in a lobby cost around 80 €. For me - nice experience but once was enough.",74
MBS,2,“Amazing pool - shame about the rest!”,"Just stayed at MBS for 3 nights and won't be staying there again. The pool and views are next to none but the checking in and out experience was dreadful, non smoking rooms stank of smoke, the buffet breakfast was pretty ordinary, the decor tacky (particularly the foyer) and we had to chase up house keeping to have our room made up. The one plus was a comfy bed. Overall extremely disappointing and overrated!",84
MBS,3,“Value for money?”,"Stay 3 nights in Premire room with city view from May 7-10,2012. This hotel is renow for its design for that they get 5 stars but don't expect 5 stars for room and services. With its 2561 rooms you can't expect real service, room clean once a day, no bed turn over at night, bed sheet is clean but not of 5 stars quality. Room decor is simply ok. What you pay for is its scenery and very spectacular roof top pool. Good value...????",328
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands - once is enough!”,"The wonderful pool is almost enough to justify a stay at this vast hotel. Our-check in at the airport-style counter was unimpressive and staff treatment was perfunctory. Our friend who arrived later, took one and a half hours to check in. He later moaned that he felt as if he were in a cattle round-up. After complaining, the upgrade given to him was scant compensation for the hassle, in my view. Disappointing that there is no sense of arrival and that your introduction to this hotel is so impersonal. The reality does not match the advertising.The reception area of the hotel (airport concourse, anyone?) is huge and impersonal as well. But, hey, what do you really expect in a hotel attached to a casino? Our room, although with a lovely outlook and view, was \tres ordinare\"". Decor so subdued, a bit like a bowl of \""blanc mange\"", really, just a beige box. The noisy family and their T.V. in the next room could be heard very clearly through the walls. \""Just get us out of here\"", we thought.We had chosen this hotel so that we could sample the fine dining and that pool.So after a quick shower and change, out of \""the beige box\"" we got!The pool is wonderful and worth staying in this hotel for one night, perhaps. The adjacent Galleria shopping mall, almost empty was entertaining, especially the gondola in the water on the lower level. And there are a few nice places to have lunch or afternoon tea.The restaurants and bars of the Big Name chefs were eerily almost empty, too. It seems that it is the big winners from the casino who keep them afloat.The champagne bar next to Guy Savoy restaurant served good food and great wine with expected professionalism. Most enjoyable, but pricey, as you would expect. Although, the dull roar of the casino is a constant, strange background music and more than a little off-putting. So, on balance, once is enough,""",304
MBS,3,“Disappointed”,"My wife and I stayed at MBS for 2 nights, on our way back from Bali. We were quiet excited about staying here, mainly to enjoy the hotel itself. From the moment you enter this hotel you get a feeling of being in a factory where everything is mechanized. A very well managed factory mind you. However we were expecting something different. On hind sight i wish i had paid more attention to some of the reviews.Please dont get me wrong, there was no area of service which i could complain about. In fact the service was very efficient and prompt. What was missing was the warmth, not only from the staff but also from the hotel itself. The swimming pool area also failed to impress. The view, maybe, but the swimming pool area itself, nope, not for me. Specially with so many people just wanting to take pictures, i can only imagine what the state would be later in the day. You cant swim and most definitely there is no sense of privacy.There are some nice places to eat in this massive structure, most of them located at the shopping area. If you enjoy oriental food you would like to visit the Rasapura Masters. This is a 24Hr food court with all kinds of Asian Eats. The main focus is Far Eastern food which i love. A bit overpriced for a food court i thought but everything i ate was mouth watering. Mozza is another place where pizzas are supposed to be great. Could not try it myself tough. Pita Pan also had good, healthy, vegetarian Mediterranean options. A bit over priced again.Staying at MBS: Please reconsider if you have the option. Will not recommend staying at this place. Visit this place once if you are in Singapore and that should do it.",126
MBS,3,“Stunning architecture”,"I stayed at MBS in April 12 and I was very excited to be staying there but I have to say for the price it doesn't come up to expectation. The property is rated as 5 star but i think it is an exaggeration to be rated as a 4 star. We were in a suite, the carpet was badly stained, the upholstery was grubby and floors badly marked but when you have almost 100% occupancy why care!! I thought the pool was fabulous and I loved breakfast in the Sky on 57. It was also an advantage having an MTR station in the property but aside from that I think the property is overpriced for the standard of room. There are better deals in Singapore",121
MBS,3,“Disappointed”,"We arrived tired at 11.30 pm to check in to be told our room was not ready. We had to wait until 1am. The room was good, clean with a fantastic view. We asked for a late check out on our day of departure (which we felt was the least they could do considering the check in fiasco) we were told we could not have this but could use the hospitality suite to shower before we flew. I was given a key to the suite and on opening the door it was filled top to bottom with other guests and no where to even sit. It would seem that marina bay sands is very complacent about the value of it's guests.",99
MBS,3,“If this hotel were a watch it would be a fake Rolex”,"The Marina Bay sands is hugely over-rated. The place is enormous and therefore enormously over-crowded. The rooftop pool is a huge attraction, but forget about those pictures that show it near empty. At no point did I see it anything less than rammed! It's a great pool yes, and for obvious reasons guests flock to it. Because of that it feels about as relaxing and pleasant as a public swimming pool. That was hugely disappointing.The hotel is all bling and glitz which is fine, but if you want a true 5 star experience this hotel cannot offer you that.",285
MBS,3,“Brace yourself it's going to be expensive!”,"The check in was a bit of a disaster that took 35mins to complete as they had not cleanded our room at 7:15pm in the evening! However that became a win-fall for us as we were up-graded to a suite, so the room was AMAZING and it really was in every way. This is the hotel to go to if you want to have a big splurge in Singapore but its not a \private\"" hotel and there are not many areas where a couple can sit on there own. The hotel reminded me of a cruise ship environment except you have to pay for everything and it's quite expensive, especially dinner. There's a shopping centre attached to the complex so you can get meals at local pricing and that makes a big difference. The pool is out of this world and one would probably book this hotel just to have a swim in the pool for the day, unbelievable. I found the breakfast to be just too busy, hard to relax when there's 1,500 people trying to get their eggs (I asked the waiter how many they served on an average day), it's just a very busy place....I stay in a lot of 5 star hotels around the world for business and pleasure but would I stay here again? NO, there's far better value for the money where the rooms are much cheaper and are perhaps located in better positions. OK you can't beat the view from the pool or if you have a city view room. It might be worthwhile considering doing 2 nights at this hotel and then relocate somewhere else so you have some money left over to spend on other things.""",72
MBS,3,“Barely a 3 stars”,"Enjoy it while it is relatively new!But the service is zero. Actually there is none. Well difficult to have a luxury standard with 2600 rooms. You fall into the mass market category ... At the price of a good 5 stars!But why would they bother. The occupancy rate is close to 95%like me, you are attracted by the pool? It is amazing indeed but just over crowded with dirty towels left everywhere...",282
MBS,1,“Worst hotel stay of the decade”,"We heard they were having lots of teething problems when it opened, so we waited a few months, and finally stayed last year but the experience was appalling. From airport pickup to getting a cab back to the airport after check out, our 3D2N stay was the worst experience I've ever had in Singapore. The pickup at the airport did not arrive, then we were checked in at the VIP lane where a trainee was working and it took so long for her to process, we missed our lunch, they've even forgot to offer us champagne (while other waiting guests were getting a glass). On the in-house TV channel they advertised Breakfast at the top floor starting from 10am. When we got there at 10:15, they told us they close at 10am! Nobody seem to be aware about the In house channel's incorrect opening hours, and nobody seemed to care! They could not accommodate us, despite it was their mistake, and told us they were busy in preparing for lunch. When I walked passed the restaurant around lunch time, there were less than 10 people dining. There was odor coming from the toilet, and the bath tub would not drain. I called maintenance around 10pm, and they came at 2am!! This is not Singapore standards that we were used to. When we mentioned this to the Front Manager politely, all they did was give us a comment form and they responded with a typical email standard apology note. Gee, I'm so touched of just how sincere they are. Definitely NOT staying there again. Just see the place, but not worth staying. They cater you in thousands, and will treat you like cattle.",463
MBS,2,“long way to go before it's worth the 5 stars”,"a lot of people talk about this magnificent hotel, with stunning view and a wonderful swimming pool on the roof.potentially, this hotel could be a very good one. in reality, it's not.starting from the fact that you have a shuttle bus which drops you off in the basement of the hotel, in a parking lot (noisy and dusty, as a parking lot is) where NOBODY helps you with the luggage and you have to find your way up to the reception, following the signs. wouldn't be nicer to have a side entrance of the hotel, for guests who arrive with the shuttle bus?the hall is beautifully decorated with big vases and flowers and plants everywhere, so you take a deep breath and smile again. until you reach the reception desk. then the smile disappears.the staff is not trained enough to deal with so many people. they work like robots: asking you the same questions, in the same order, with the same tone and the same answers to each and every client. no eye contact, unless when they wait for you to hand out your passport.I happen to have 2 rows of receptionists: one dealing with you directly and one standing on their back, whispering the answer if \row number one\"" was not able to give you the information requested.the concierge took t-w-e-n-t-y-f-i-v-e minutes to give us the ticket for a show in the theater inside the hotel and she also gave us the wrong plan to choose the seats from...on the restaurant sky 57 the view is nice and the buffet breakfast is vary and good.but, then again, on a three days stay, one day it took us 3 requests to have an espresso (long way to be a good one) and every day the tablecloths were stained. better have just the -cleaned- glass table with nice linen napkins, don't you think?and the kitchen door was open all the time. no, not an open kitchen. just the usual kitchen, but with the door opened to the room where you are supposed to have a quiet breakfast.the rooms are comfortable and spacious and the bathroom clean and with all the amenities.the swimming pool on top floor is nice, but packed with people from the morning to the evening. as it's not a proper deep pool: people don't swim, but just bathe and take pictures of the view. there is no way to have a spot unless you go there at 7am. but, apparently, a lot of people do.I guess that with 2500 guest rooms you cannot expect to be better than this.accurate and personal service is always much more appreciated. the beauty of singapore is also a walk in the botanic garden and not spending many hours in the casino... we're not in LV.""",206
MBS,2,“Luxurious doesn't mean PERFECT!”,"Stayed period : Oct 2010Room Type : Premier RoomCheck in : Thats a long q for check in and a smelly face receptionist is doing our check in procedures.Room : Its a big room with huge bath tub and well facilities and TWG tea leaves is awesome!Something i've to mentioned is u will get a surprise when u switch on the tv, ur name will appear on the tv screen!Pool : the pool is awesome indeed! but... too crowded!!!!!!!!! u dont even have a chance to swimming for more then 2 feet!Food : We order room service from front desk, the food were serves after 30 mins with well presentation. but the taste is sucks!!!! Services : 5 stars hotel with 1 stars services, they will hint u for tips and their body full of tobacco smells. one thing i cant bear is, i take lift up to the swimming pool with a server and he never help to press the open door button for me and he blck my way out of lift.Breakfast buffet : crowded and lousy service again. We have to q before entry our restaurant and thats really waste our romantic time.So i think i will never go to the MBS again.",106
MBS,3,“To big to enjoy”,Spent 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands and while the room was above expectations the whole place is just to big. Breakfast in the main restaurant was pricey and like standing in line at your local cafeteria.By the time you got back to the table the meal was cold.Even though there was more staff on the floor than i have seen in other hotels it was still hard to get a coffee or tea refill.The pool is truly amazing but i question whether it is the difference between paying top dollar here or going to another hotel that provides service and attention to the details.,75
MBS,3,“Sumptuous breakfast”,"The place is new and very commercial. Had stayed there for a week with my parents while we were holidaying. It's comfortable and seems all new, has a great view but lacks that charm that I found in a couple of other places in Singapore in previous visits. The complimentary breakfast is really good, no seriously don't miss the buffet breakfast. All-in-all it's conveniently located and has all the modern comforts you could ask for.",240
MBS,3,“The pool is amazing but it feels like staying at a shopping mall”,"I had no pretensions when booking in at MBS, after reading reviews I know I wasn't getting genuine class and luxury - like many people I wanted to see the pool and the view. The check-in procedure is pretty hectic and the worst of it all was that our room was not ready and we had to wait another 2 hours after a flight. They say that check-in is at 3pm, yet it wasn't till 6pm that we got into a room. The lobby feels like a airport or shopping mall and the staff just seem overwhelmed. When paying $450 per night, the one thing you don't expect is to have to wait to be in your room. There are also issues with the plumbing - I've read this elsewhere, there are sometimes blocked sinks and funky smells coming from the shower. I will say that staff are very friendly and helpful when you ask them but mostly they are too busy to ask you, not their fault but just the sheer scale of people going through the doors. There is no personal touch here. If you're after a genuine feel of class and luxury, I'd skip the MBS. It's only worth the experience of swimming in the pool which is breathtaking. I don't know whether I'd do it again - definitely not at those high prices. Breakfast was too $$$ - you'd expect free breakfast when paying so much.",150
MBS,3,“Interesting place”,"MBS is a large hotel consisting of three large towers. The architecture is very cool but unless you are interested in a very busy hotel with lots of kids I wouldn't return. There are many great dining choices in the mall that is connected and the suite that I had was very clean and the service was not as bad as I had read about. With all that being said, the place is simply a mad house, the pool area which is spectacular is completely loaded with young kids and noisy and they badly need an adult only pool. I went for 15 minutes and left.All in all this place is fine if you are there for a convention, want to gamble or there with your family but there are simply too many other places to stay in Singapore if you are there on biz, romance or just to relax",473
MBS,1,"“Beautiful on the outside, rotten in the inside...”","Just returned from Singapore where i stayed for the first time at the marina Bay Sands hotel: the biggest Circus you will ever experience !! it's a mall, it's an airport, it's a train station, it's a football field... All this combined, it ends up being a zoo :) Being a hotelier, i was shocked at the level of service and the lack of standards applied in that property. The room was very basic, to the standard of a 3 star hotel. Furnitures chipped, bathroom amenities pathetic, TV channels limited, no welcome amenities, no welcome letter, no turndown amenities...This hotel clearly could not care less who you are and how much you are paying to stay in this \so called\"" iconic place : THE supposedly \""place\"" in Singapore....Well, think twice ! The service at reception and bell desk has been nothing but irritating. I will spare you the details as it would take numerous pages. Asked for the General manager to call me, I was told there was NO General Manager, only a Hotel Manager. Fine as long as he or she calls...Up to today, and after my return, i still do not know whether the hotel manager is a \""he\"" or a \""she\"" as i am yet to have received any calls...Well done for \""customer satisfaction\"".. Oh, and remember : you need to be OUT by 11 am. Their check in time is 3pm...4 hours to turn over a room is a very \""productive\"" number...NOT ! Too bad the hotels were all full in Singapore due to conferences, as i wanted to check out and leave. also, your room key does not need to be inserted in order to access your floor. Just go in with someone else and press the floor you would like to get to...as simple as that ! my key would access all floors and all towers. I then decided to check on the new Ku De Ta and the \""talk of the town\"" swimming pool. Wow, the most crowded area of the hotel with A VIEW !! Thank God there was a view or i would have wasted my 3 minutes in the elevator all the way to the 57th floor. Overall, a highly overrated hotel and probably the poorest value for money that i ever encountered in Singapore. This is really sad and i would never recommend for anyone to stay there. I travel to Singapore once a month, and will ensure i stay at recognized branded hotels at cheaper prices yet amazing standards. Guess you cant go wrong ! Don't know why i stayed there at the first place. I guess that as a hotelier, it is always good to see what's out there...This stay was definitely an \""experience to remember\"". YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!!! On a positive note, the food was excellent !!""",300
MBS,2,"“All hype....probably the best pool view, that's it..”","I was there because I had my Board Meeting at the Convention Centre across. The shopping was great, the Casino I cannot comment cause I did not have the time to visit. But for the hotel? The lobby was too simple, as like many casino resorts, they want to move people as fast as possible which means many would be waiting their fathers/mothers to check in...NO SEATING AREA....if you have kids like I do...you're screwed. Check-in was strictly 3pm....if you're nosy enough...you may get your room after 2pm....They expect you to roam through the exclusive shopping area. they took your luggage which was a plus.Breakfast was SGD30++.....not recommendedRoom was small for the price paid....but then again Singapore hotel rates is the highest in South East Asia anyway... No kids centre, as guests u get to go to the viewing deck for free and use the pool. The pool was amazing ....But everybody seems to be here for the pool , so not enough deck chairs....The jacuzzi was only for 16 and above.... so I can't get in with my 10 year old daughter...No newspaper in the morning....the mini bar is triggered, if you move an item, its automatically charged, No space even for your own stuff....I have a 2 year old son...not even space for his milk...room wifi is free which is good but ventilation of the wc is very bad...Yes its not meant for a family hotel it seems but I do have business to attend to and I don't think they welcome children.....My meetings was at Angsana rooms at the Convention Centre, but none of the staff, even at the reception know or even heard of the Angsana rooms.... My opinion?? Its just the hype of marketing....unless you are really into the amazing infinity pool facing the city...",278
MBS,3,“Still not impressed”,"It was my second stay at the MBS. First experience was unpleasant and I thought I'd never be back again. My husband was given a free night redeemed from the club rewards, so I thought \why not, the hotel might have gotten their act together after operating for some time now\"".Check in took less than 15 minutes, a tremendous improvement compared to my first stay. We went to our room and there were a few suitcases which didn't belong to us. Called out to the housekeeper who happened to be outside our room and asked her to check, who paged for the supervisor, who then paged for front desk to send someone up. We waited outside the room for at least 15 minutes while they finally sorted out it's probably a wrong delivery, removed the suitcases and we finally got our room.I called express service to check on the dining outlets which allows us to redeem our reward dollars. I was put on hold for 10 mins (!) and the next person to answer the phone did not know what I had asked for and I had to repeat my question.The Premier room is very spacious with a sitting area and coffee table. The bathroom is comfortably spacious and clean. Overall, the room is very nice, except the pillows are too soft (that's just my personal preference). We went up to the pool and it wasn't as crowded as the first time (maybe because it's a weekday). But at least it doesn't feel like a public area now. Buffet dinner at Rise was good but nothing to rave about and I don't think the spread is worth $68++.""",141
MBS,3,“Way overpriced for what you get”,"We booked an Orchid Suite and paid almost SD 1,000 per night. When checking in, we didn't feel like we were treated as someone who pays so much for a room. There was no one showing us where to go. The view of the room was not nice, it was located on the fourth floor. The room itself was nice, spacious, clean and a very nice bathroom. Since the hotel was fully booked we couldn't move to a higher floor, but the next day we could. The other room was located on the 45th floor, the view was much nicer, but the room much smaller. The pool at the rooftop was very crowded, way too many people if you ask me. Breakfast was ok, but not spectacular. All in all, the rooms were nice, staff regular, but price far too high.",423
MBS,2,“Tourist Attraction - nothing more”,"Unfortunately had to stay here again as I was accompanying my brother on a visit to family in Singapore and he wanted to stay there (plus a coule of days were a pressie from my other bro who lives in Singapore). It was so sad that he got disallusioned so quickly. Firstly checkin - we were early (12pm) but they said that our room was now available. All good so far, until I was shown what was going to be debited to my credit card account. Expecting the usual $500 credit card deposit, it was nearly $2500.00. When I asked what was going on, they said it was to pay for my room. It then took nearly two hours and 5 staff to convince them that my room had been prepaid. I showed them my voucher, my receipt from them, my credit card statement when I paid the accommodation in full etc etc. But they still would not beleive me. Luckily I then found an old email from their guest relations manager confirming my booking, payment, specific room request etc etc. This manager was located and quickly verified on their booking system that i had paid in full. Yet 4 other staff could not locate the same detail?Things then went from bad to worse when we were escorted to a deluxe room instead of Premier deluxe - luckily I knew the difference. Was then told no premier deluxe rooms available. I went straight downstairs again to the guest relations manager and told her that the hotel had buggered me around already, now they were trying to downgrade me? Demanded they either give us what we had paid for (nearly twice) or refund immediately in full as we would be going elsewhere immediately (i would have preferred if they had done that). A premier deluxe room was found pretty darned quick after that.From that point on usual hotel experience where the hotel is big, impersonal, totally crowded with onlookers etc. I will stil give cudos to their buffet tho - it is a wonderful experience.I hate complaining. I believe that suggestions work better, but when you have no other avenue but complaint, I try to remain cool and calm. But as far as Marina Bay Sands goes, my calmness deserted me and put a bitter taste on the stay. I am so very happy that I will never ever have to return - even as a favour to someone else who wants to stay there. Give me the Four Seasons or Mandarin any day.",231
MBS,2,“Thank God It's Got A View!!!”,"If this utterly exuberant hotel wasn't topped with an amazing pool and a view over the beautiful Singapore to die for I assume it would be empty day after day.From check in to check out you feel like a bead on their accountants abacus. Be prepared for an extremely impersonal check in with a solemn faced employee, who is obviously wishing they were atop the hotel having a swim and sun bake, because they seem to not enjoy smiling, eye contact or interacting with guests.The Rooms on the highway side had a large amount of road noise day and night. The Air Con was too loud to sleep with going and crying babies in adjacent rooms were easily heard.The odd few guest of the hotel who are able to get somewhere to sit by the pool and sip ridiculously expensive beverages are few and far between. Most of the deckchairs in the Skypark had been \shot-gunned\"" by the early risers, whom i'm almost certain leave a wet towel on there deckchair while exploring Singapore all day.The TV worked for half of our stay and then we waited for the \""Technician\"" to come and repair, I assume the next guest might be still waiting!Great idea, poor execution!!I would suggest a trip to the Skypark for a quick look and a few photos before heading back to any other of Singapore's Great Hotels!!""",62

Everything other aspect of the hotel is a nightmare. Everything they could possibly get wrong they did - e.g. they put us in a smaller room than we'd pay for, our keys didn't work on 5 occasions, they couldn't find our ferry transfers which meant we had to pay twice, breakfast is like feeding time at the zoo, the staff are unhelpful and many do not speak English, and the place is massive, impersonal and chaotic. It's also ridiculously overpriced.",114
MBS,2,“Looks good but it don't work”,"Glitzy new and a landmark for Singapore , I seen it get constructed from scratch, for a treat me and my daughter booked 6 nights as we thought we would be 5 star, rooms were standard interior decor was shady, forget a wifi or even a phone signal if your high up in the towers, air con is set on one setting ice cold and noisy, pool at the tops impressive and the view very nice, as is Singapore is overcrowded and queuing to get booked in your room that isn't ready so we wait a few hr's and queue again. From the outside it shows it's pride from the inside it doesn't work",343
MBS,3,“Overrated!!”,"It was our first time booking at this hotel, and we were really looking forward in staying here.The hotel architecture designs is nice, beds are comfortable, great view facing the ocean (especially at night...perfect!!), free Wi-Fi, as expected…the pool is amazing and the location is very convenient via MRT.However, we encountered some problems with the room facilities such as the toilet flush and the plug from the bathroom sink is stuck. We called up the hotel operator, and 10 mins later the technician was up to rectify the problems. He managed to fix the bathroom sink, but unable to do anything about the flushing, and the only solution he gave us is to wait for 1 mins for the water to build up before we flush (which we didn't even bother, since the water continually flowed).Besides the upset, this hotel do provide free airport shuttle service for every 1/2 hour from6AM to 10PM. We've reached there and queued up in order to wait for the 6PM shuttle to airport.When it's our turn to hop on the bus, there's a guy there told us that the bus is already full and we have to wait for 30 mins for another shuttle to pick us up (which we can't accept as we're not late for the scheduled time and we do have a flight to catch up). We asked a different guy whether there's another way which they can help us, and he was so adamant and said NO! we have to wait, and then he just walk away, which is very rude. Luckily, here's come our savior \Gino\"", who's a very polite guy and someone that can made decision, he knows of our situation and efficiently arranged another bus to pick up the rest of the passengers to the airport. We're so grateful to Gino and thank you very much!As a conclusion, the hotel is definitely overrated. Besides the view, pool & Gino, the rest is just like any other hotels in Singapore.

Rooms were upto standard but there was no furniture at all on the balconies again really sterile. The pool area is impressive, but just way to busy to actually relax and way to crowded - There are shops every where in the hotel and you really are in a shopping complex, no intimacy at all, I think this is a cool Hotel to stay at but i feel that many people will just do this one once - lot better hotels in Singapore that have better value for money - my opinion misses the mark !",201
MBS,3,"“Pretentious, poor service but amazing view”","It is a given that the view is the wow factor. Both sides of the Skypark gives a view of everything around Singapore and a view that I have never experienced before. Almost everything else about the hotel is a let down except maybe the taste of the cocktails... The cost of drinks and food is simply ridiculous, the staff are impersonal and impolite and only one place to hang your towel (if you were like me and didn't know that a little switch is automatically on do not disturb and not please clean then you will have wet towels)! Back to the skypark... There are probably enough seats for less than half of the people staying at the hotel so it's a bit of a mission to find seats for a group of four. The good thing is a third of the pool is off limits to children. The rooms are not very sound proof and you can here the people in the next room. All in all there are much nicer, more friendly hotels in Singapore than the Marina Bay Sands. Maybe it's worth staying at this hotel for a night or two to experience the pool and view.",224
MBS,2,“All hype but doesn't deliver”,"Was really looking forward in staying here... During my travels I have been watching this hotel being built and made sure I would stay as soon as I could.We arrived very early in the morning (way before check in) ... So they kindly too our bags so we could walk around and look at the hotel. We had some breakfast which was horrendous. People were pushing and tables were cramped in. Food quality was like a school canteen... And over priced.. Very very disappointing.We made our way up to the sky deck where the pool is. The view is absolutely beautiful. The pool has two areas. One for families and one where children are not allowed. I thought this was a nice touch for couples looking for relaxation. Lots of places to sit in or out of the sun.Our room had the worlds most comfortable bed a lovely view of the ocean... BUT.... The air conditioning didn't work for a while and the room service was soooooo over priced (bowl of chips $20 Singapore dollars) This hotel is so large that it's hard to get personal service, really, you feel like just a number here.. So I would only suggest you stay for the experience of swimming in the pool....you can get better service and quality for half the price elsewhere. Very very average.",426
MBS,3,“Shame about the service - amazing pool though.”,"We stayed at MBS for 1 night coming from Europe on our way to Thailand in December 2011. We are 2 adults and 3 children, 10, 7 and 3 years old. Already the booking was quite an experience - we booked in April to make sure to have a large enough room with 2 extra beds for the older kids. At the time, reservation told us that they cannot guarantee extra beds as they depend \upon availability\"" - when we asked where our kids were supposed to sleep should there be no extra beds available, they could not give an answer. We found that ridiculous- surely when you reserve months in advance they should be able to get hold of 2 extra beds?Still, we decided to go ahead and try our luck, as we had fallen in love with a picture of the infinity pool and observation deck in a magazine. We used the shuttle from the airport which was convenient. The hotel is huuuge - although we knew it was big - make no mistake, this is a factory. The check in took at least one hour, during which they managed to \""loose\"" our luggage which reappeard hours later. the kids were obviously tired after a long flight, but there is no seating in this huge lobby, and unless you are happy to go to the restaurant there and pay for a full meal, all you can do is stand and wait.Then we were shown our room, which was nice enough - we had taken one of the rooms situated ont he lower floors, biut I am sure that the ones higher up are even nicer - and - surprise - there were no extra beds. So we started an endless round of calls about the beds etc - this and the wait for the luggage took ages and was really annoying as all we wanted to do was to go up and have a swim in the pool. No extra beds were provided after all, and not enough bedding, so we shared pillows and duvets, one son slept on the floor and the other one in our bed. Not what you would expect for that price.The only redeeming feature is the truly magnificent observation deck and pool. This is really good fun and the kids loved it. The view of the skyline is amazing, so we did not regret staying after all, but won't be coming back. I guess - or hope - the service is better when you book a really expensive suite!""",95
MBS,2,“Horrible service”,"I have never been treated as bad as I was in Marina Bay Sands. The service was mostly plain rude, was given a wrong room (and they made us wait for 5 hours for the new one!) and overall the hotel is way overrated. However, the rooftop lounge for suite quests was very nice and the service there was excellent. Also the rooftop pool is awesome and suite rooms are nice and offer a breathtaking city view. (Normal rooms not recommended at all, you get much better value in other 5 star hotels in Singapore).",236
MBS,1,“Total disappointment to what the hotel claim in advertisement”,"I do hope that this email wl reached someone who are seriously enough to make Marina Sands to live up to the prx you are charging, and the reputuation you are claiming over the advertisement, as I am not seeing any of this in this hotel from my 3 days 2 nights stay in the hotel !first reception staff, Victor (on the 3rd tower on 5th Apr at 5.05pm ) is very rude and disrespectful to guest. I was than put in a room that filty ! floors are stained, chairs are stained and even the cover on TV table is with cup stains !! I have photos which i wl put on the internet to show u.Checkin out on the 7th Apr is just as bad....Michelle (who had called herself as Duty manager) on the 3rd tower, at 12.30pm, very lazy and literally \pointed\"" me with her fingers to the reception counter when i said i wanted to checked out. She clearly ignore me on this and simply pointed me other way, just wondeirng if this atitude of hers is because i am wearing aTshirt and a pair of jeans and being a chinese ?? as when the nxt european couples comeout, shes all keen to check them in. the decoration of this hotel is really dull and very old China style hotel which i have seen 10 years ago along with their standards !!!""",495
MBS,3,“Great views but overpriced”,"If you like huge, crowded, glitzy, to be seen – then the Marina Bay Sands is for you. It has an enormous entrance hall resembling an airport terminal with high ceilings, three different places to check in, and tons of shops and cafes. You will get quite a bit of exercise walking form one place to the next while dodging the crowds. Getting to the observation deck on top involves taking two different elevators and the whole place feels like there is a constant coming and going. If you’ve come for world class shopping, this is the place to be, as the adjacent shopping centre (there is also a casino) offer pretty much everything you could wish for, and more.However, I can’t whole-heartedly recommend it. For the kind of service you’re getting, it is overpriced. We are from Africa and spoiled by stays at warm, cozy, luxury game lodges in the bush, where a total of sixteen guests at any one time guarantees lots of individual attention and personalized service. Granted, you can’t compare the two, but the service at the Marina Bay Sands was nothing more than average. You didn’t get any turn-down service, for instance, and we also didn’t like the way we were nickled-and-dimed in such an exclusive place. Like having to pay for the water taxi to take you across the bay, or an early check-in. Or the fact that they still found a way to wring more money out of you by cordoning off a section at the Sky Bar, where the nice comfortable sofas were, and only allowing you in if you purchased two entire bottles of spirits (standing room only for the “regular folk”). We had club level rooms and I have to say the club level breakfast wasn't all that great. Not bad but just not good enough for all the hype and the price tag.The most striking two features of the Marina Bay Sands hotel are the look of it from across the bay and the view from the top looking at the magnificent Singapore skyline. Both can be had for free or a very modest fee, so why not go there for the view and stay somewhere else? Get a day pass to the observation deck on the 57th floor for S$19 to take in the view, or have lunch at Ku De Ta or the Sky Bar. Or you could come up specifically for the nightly chocolate bar in the club lounge. All this can be had without paying what I consider to be a ghastly overpriced room rate. You won’t get to lounge by the (admittedly spectacular) infinity pool as part of that, but still it will be very worthwhile. Whether you end up staying at the Marina Bay Sands or just visit the Skypark for the day, one thing is true: You won’t get such a nice breeze anywhere else in Singapore!Longer article and pictures can be viewed on Joburg Expat http://www.joburgexpat.com/2012/04/hotel-with-view.html.",63
MBS,2,“Mass but not Class”,"Spend a few days in march with some friends,we expected 5 star service,but we got a poor service for a lot of money.House kepping and the rest of hotel staff uneducated and mostly unhelpfull.Sky park is the only thing which is to be recomeded in this hotel,rest is more or less not to be recomended.This hotel is def MASS but defenetlly not CLASS",88
MBS,3,“Big Enough but Room for Improvement”,"Just stayed few days there. I took their hotel bus at the airport. The hotel staff registered my details once. I arrived hotel and went to their ASK counter for room keys. Then the staff brought me to another counter for check in procedures again. So what for the first registration at the bus?Their sign is not clear. There is no sign at cross point.The hotel is big in size. However, the decoration and equipment are not as good as the Sands Hotel Macao.The Skypark is good indeed.",82
MBS,3,“Wonderful building but normal service”,"The building is wonderful and the concept of sky pool is fantastic as well..Room is comfortable and clean, location was great as it attached with high end shopping mall and easy access by cab. probably one or two years later, it's even accessible with MRT which is now in progress....The only thing is the service provided is terrible, queuing for more than 15 minutes for check in and seems like the receptionist have limited knowledge on the room service.No second stay please.",99
MBS,3,"“Casino hotel, Sky pool saves the day.....”","Been to casino hotel previous in vegas, but I would not give this hotel anothery try because it is just too expensive. For the price we should breakfast included but unfortunately the room I booked was \special\"" rate already......so breakfast wasn't included...Room was acceptable. Huge and roomy. Location was average, actually I wanted to give two stars as I was forced to walk from car park, to the shoppes and then took a huge detour before I reached the hotel lobby......pool was great addition, if not I think this hotel will have much lower ratings.....Sorry, no return for more.""",312
MBS,3,“Don't dream 5 star service”,"We have been there between 25-28 March and stayed at Grand room.I've read the comments about the lack of service on TA before going to there but as I stayed there before and I was going mostly because of the casino I still wanted to stay there.Honestly,they were much better than before during check in(it took just a few minutes,maybe as it was not crowded and we got our luggage to the room in 10-15 minutes)But... although the receptionist guy was helpful,he needs an immediate training about how to talk to the guests.While he was checking our room I asked \on which floor will the room be\""and he answered \""can you give me a break,I am checking???!!!!????I would love to give him a break if my mom was not in the rush for the casino.Anyway,after we checked in I was again disappointed when we reached the room because during my booking I mentioned 2 times that it will my girl friends birthday and it would be nice if they prepare something for her...but not even a note!Everybody knows their amazing pool 200 meters above the ground but you should also know that its impossible to swim there as there are 2500 rooms and as a result hundreds of people and kids are using that one pool.The room was nice.On the 27th floor not so noisy.Once, we asked the concierge how to go to Sentosa Island and he gave us the map and mentioned about the shuttle bus which we missed and I asked for a taxi(for me a 5 star hotel concierge should tell you all the options for anywhere you want to visit,especially it its Singapore which is not a big city)Finally,very nice,interesting architecture...but not a good service according what you pay.I guess,I will stay at another marina hotel for my next visit which are mostly walking distance to the casino.""",387
MBS,2,“5 stars price 3 stars check-in service”,"i've stay in Marina Bay Sands Hotel quite many times, but still facing the same problem. Check-in! I booked the room via website at it's stated there check-in at 3pm. The very first time I came to the hotel, I reached at 2pm and wish to get the room at 3pm since it's stated everywhere in the website. But the very first time i'm facing is the room is not available and the front desk has asked me to wait until 5pm to get the room. So they give me the room card and let me go to the skypark. After resting for few hours on the skypark, i went downstair to get my room at 5pm but in the end the room is still not available! End up i have to wait another hour to get my room. Since i've booked and paid online why should i need to wait for my room? if i dont check-in will Marina Bay Sands Hotel dont charge on my credit card? it's impossible! The second time i stay a night at Marina Bay Sands also facing the same problem. I reach there at 12 noon to get my room checked in and yes they are right i should come back to the front desk before 3pm to get the key card and i will get my room at 3pm. So i waited, nearly 3pm i reach the front desk, they told me the room is not ready yet, have to wait for house keeping to do the cleaning! Lastly i get my room at 4.15pm! the third time i stayed, i purposely called before 3pm and try to check-in via telephone which i make payment online and i stay in the city for a while and will be back after 3pm to get my room (hopefully), ending up i still have to wait another 2 hours which the front desk person who promised me to call me without calling me! finally i get my room at 6pm. The fourth time is the worst, i called to Marina Bay Sands hotel telling all my informations and they confirmed, and they promised me to get my room at 3pm. but ending up i get my roon at 7pm! They are facing too many room reservations dispute which made unconvienece to us!",149
MBS,2,"“Sensational, but no 5 stars”","We made our reservation 4 months before. At check in at 18:15 we were told that the room was not ready yet. On my reply there for I wanted a late check-out, the receptionist suddenly was able to find a room.Only this room was on the second floor, all you could see were palm trees, but the more you could hear. The motorway is about 50 meter from the building, without any structure to reduce the traffic noise (no double windows, no sound screen along the road) I wonder till which floor this traffic noise will be troublesome.But for the rest the personal is very good and pleasant and the whole complex is sensational; the roof of course, but also the shopping maal and the art museum ( with very nice Andy Warhol exposition at the moment). Plus a light art show around the inner lake during this month.",46
MBS,3,“Impersonal service - Great pool”,The hotel seems to be just an addendum to the casino for Sands. Its run like a massive plant and the service is accordingly quite impersonal. The Infiniti pool is probably the only reason I would advice locals of Singapore to spend a relaxing day here,410
MBS,2,“Great pool does not make up for everything else!”,"I have always wanted to stay a Marina Bay Sands and on a recent one night stopover in Singapore I got my chance. Having booked into a Premium City View room I could not wait to the get to my room after a delayed flight resulted in a 3am check in. We are taken to our room by a porter who stands there waiting to be tipped. After he leaves I go out onto the balcony to quickly take in the view before going to bed & see that I am on the wrong side of the hotel, our room is facing the ocean, not the city. I ring reception who tells me that I did not book a city view. Luckily I had a printed copy of my reservation which clearly stated Premium City View & insisted that we be moved to the room we had booked. The guy on the phone didn’t seem to care less and tells me that all the city view rooms are all booked anyhow. I ask to be reimbursed the difference as we were now staying in a lesser room & was told that this is impossible as we had booked through a third party website. The best he could do was give us a $100 food voucher to make up the difference. I was told I can use it in certain restaurants and it the charge would be taken off my bill. Finally getting to sleep at 4am, we wake in the morning to rush downstairs to use our $100 food voucher before having to check out. Breakfast for two pretty much covered the $100. We then quickly went up to the 57th floor to check out the pool then had to head straight back to our room to get packed and out of there for check out. Upon checkout we had to wait in line for ever as everyone before us seemed to be arguing about their bills. When we finally got served, our breakfast was still on our bill we were told that they had to record of us being offered a $100 food voucher. By this point I was beyond livid. Another 20mins later and we are finally told begrudgingly that we are free to go without paying for the overpriced breakfast.Will not stay here again & will not recommend it to friends. Great pool.... yes, but rooms are average & service is unforgivable at the price they charge!",170
MBS,1,“The worst 5 star hotel in Singapore”,"A very poorly designed hotel despite spending over 3 billion dollars on the construction it falls well short on basics. The light switches are poorly placed, there is a severe lack of power points and the hot/cold water tap adjustment is extremely poor and difficult to alter once your hand is wet. The cupboards are poorly laid out. In general it falls well short of other 5 star hotels and is grossly over priced. They have spared no expense on the stone used in the bathrooms and lobby but the actual construction work is very poor, paint over the stone, the over use of silastic, poor grouting and the quality of the paint work is what you would expect from a 15 year old Indian 3 star hotel. There is a major shortage of breakfast restaurants meaning that the breakfast service is poor and highly disorganised. The staff are to zealous and remove plates while you are still eating. Overall a hotel best avoided unless you are a casino junky.",744
MBS,3,“The room was big enough for a family”,"Despite the horror stories on Tripadvisor there was only one couple ahead of us in the check-in queue when we arrived on a Monday afternoon in late August. It turned out that the access cards given to us did not work, which was actually lucky: we booked and paid in advance for a Premiere room on a high floor, but we were given a room on a low floor. I realized this only while returning to the reception to complain about the non-functional key. After I complained about this they upgraded us without any fuss to a Grand room in the correct zone - I guess no such Premier rooms were available. The Grand room was really nice. There was a large double bed, a couch that could be opened up to be a double bed for the kids, plenty of space, a huge TV, and a view to the sea. The nicest surprise was the large bathroom which had a bathtub, a separate shower cubicle, and after fiddling with all the switches it turned out that there was also a really nice view directly to the Merlion once the motor had rolled up the curtain. My only complaint is that the actual bathroom does not have any drains on the floor, so things got a bit messy when our youngest child decided that also Daddy should get wet when I was giving him a bath. :-oAs we had expected, the hotel restaurants and bars were shockingly expensive for a family man, so we ended up eating all our meals elsewhere. We had all breakfasts in the food court of the shopping mall located across the road, which possibility had been a big factor when we were selecting the hotel. Access was convenient through a tunnel, although the route was rather twisty.The rooftop swimming pool was quite nice. However, it was not deep while being quite busy with people enjoying the view. The pool is not that convenient if you are focused on swimming as exercise. Early mornings might be different, though. Our room provided bathrobes and slippers, so you could change in the room and take the lift to the pool. There is a security check when the enter the roof, since it is an attraction for which entrance tickets are sold to people who are not hotel customers. Towels were provided in the pool area. There are deck chairs for sunbathers, but the number is extremely limited compared to the size of the hotel. However, I suspect most people come to the hotel to do something else than improving their suntan. In the middle of the roof is a restaurant reserved for guests staying in the Club rooms - the public restaurants are at the ends of the roof.I could not see any ATMs inside the hotel. There were a few Bank of China cash machines in the tunnel connecting the hotel to the casino and the shopping mall. There were also very few shops inside the hotel. My wife bought some cookies from the delicatessen, and interestingly enough there was a booth were you could buy a short tour of the Singapore streets in a Ferrari - with a driver or with yourself at the wheel, if you paid more.The hotel is not really convenient for the MRT. The Promenade station is almost 1 kilometre away, although you can reach it easily enough by taking the bridge across the bay and following then the footpaths. We ended up using a taxi, since it was the overwhelmingly convenient option with two young children. The taxi drivers crank up quite a few mysterious extras into the meter on top of the basic fee. I believe they were for the toll roads required to access the area. Overall, our hotel experience was actually \very good\"", but only due to the free upgrade to a better class of room. Otherwise it would have been quite mediocre, but I will still consider this hotel if I'm looking for family accommodation in Singapore. At least over the Internet is was hard to find hotels that would have been as classy and cheaper while providing in a single room enough space for a family of four. If your main objective is not gambling at the casino, or if you do not need a room for more than two persons, then it will be quite easy to find better accommodation even at a cheaper price somewhere else in Singapore.""",99
MBS,2,"“Great property, horrible service”","As such the property is quite iconic and beautiful It really had all the ingredients for success! A great casino, superm rooms, excellent shopping, myriad of restaurants in the hotel tower and in the shopping boulevard just opposite, magnificient infinity pool, Ku De Ta lounge, the list is endless. However, the service was pathetic, we had to carry our own luggage from the hotel transport that picked us up at the airport. We were so disappointed that we did not extend our stay and checked out after one night and stayed in a different property.I stayed in March 2011",162
MBS,3,“A very impersonal stay - disappointed”,"I had been looking forward to my stay at the Marina Bay Sands for the 2 weeks of holidays preceding.The check-in was very impersonal, and we had to wait in a queue behind others (which I haven't had to do before in a 5 star hotel). We had a deluxe city view in Tower One and the view was amazing. The room itself was nothing to rave about very basic and to be honest not that good again for such a fancy hotel. The breakfast buffet was absolute madness and so was the pool - but thank goodness they had an adults only area to escape the screaming children. You must go up for the view. It was nice being so close to the shops and the theater you could stay in the one spot and do everything but overall I was disappointed in the Marina Bay - I would not likely go back there esp with the high prices of rooms.",34
MBS,3,“Ok stay - could definitely find more comfortable hotels at similar price”,"Room smelled quite smoky although it's a non smoking room. Pillows not very good (way too soft and flimsy) compared to similar priced hotels. Other than that, pretty satisfying stay, and very convenient location.",180
MBS,3,"“Great views, but poor service”","The pool and view was fantastic!!! Now, onto the problem with service. Pool Staff - Both times I went to the pool the guys would grut and would want to see the room card a second time. Check In - Really! I have to wait in line behind three people? This never happens at any other hotel. My room was not ready and there was a room to change, etc. This was such a nice concept, but the room was so dirty! The door where you could take a shower did not fully shut. There was no bottled water available and trash everywhere.Check out - The system was down and the staff member had no idea what to really do. He had to run after me to sign something.Plus, there were many signs stating that anything stolen was not the hotels fault and then my hotel safe did not work! How do you call a staff member to fix this? They might steal something when they come to fix it. Come and enjoy the pool, but only stay one night!",609
MBS,3,“Beware ! Double bed is a Large Single”,"Stayed here for one night this month, for 2 adults & 2 children, taking up the promotion that the hotels is offering for month of march & april 2012.Booked a deluxe room with 2 double beds. Was charged S$100 extra, presumely for extra guest.Arrived early around 1:30pm, wife checked in was told that our room is too small for 2 adults & 2 children. wanted to upgrade but was told that superior is full. (s$ 30 more than a deluxe), was told to wait till 3pm to collect key.After a long walk from the car park, i arrived at the hotel, was not happy at all after been told that double beds means large singles. Why dont they call a spade - a spade instead of calling a spoon, a spade. Talked to a different guy at the check in counter, he apologies for this \problem\"" they have with their room reservations and checked us in immediately in to a bigger room with a large sofa bed. We have deliberately check in to this hotel to stay in one of the most iconic hotels in the world but must say I did not like it.1. SKY PARK - first look was very impressive but after 20 minutes I really start to dislike it and starts to see the flaws in it. It is always crowded, 2 feet away from you there is always a person on the deck. The only time it is nice is between 6:45 till 8am, after which the crowds will return. It seems like fake plants were used on the Sky Park. Tore one piece of leaf and rub it in my palm and it doesnt feels right.2. Security - We were in tower 3 which is the lift access to the sky park, there is so many non house guest sneaking in using the lift and the key card once you have touch it allows you to access all the floors. Anyone could have followed me to my floor and room. Imagine if you have just hit a jackpot ! Tower 3 feels like a public hostel and you are in your bath robes coming down fr the pool and sharing lift like some non house guest who are in full battle gear.3. Carpark - the carpark entrance near tower 3 brings you all the way across the road in to the mall parking. It is a very long walk from there to the hotel. Luckily they offer valet parking at the rate of S$12 per 24 hours, mutiple entry. But the valet area was chaotic at times. Saw one of the valet hitting (gently) on to one of the guest who have just alight from a taxi. 4. Ambience - there isnt any. Its crowded, full of people in lobby, in lift, on sky park, in restaurants. Feels like a giant processing plant and the hotel staff is always busy onto something. There isnt a relax atmosphere to it.5. Advance service kiosk - web check in suppose to help you for a smooth check in and was told to check in at the ASK after we have done our web check in the night before but we were ASK to use the normal check in counter. There seems to be a disparity between what the web says and what has been implemented in the hotel operations.The only thing I like is the act of the chap who has given us a room that has a large sofa bed which was kind.Would l come back? No, only if the rates drop to below S$ 150 per room night for 2 adults & 2 children.""",977
MBS,3,“5* Pool and view 3* for everything else!”,"Marina Bay Sands - well it has been an experience!!To give you some context I spent 13 weeks out of 52 in hotels last year and when on business I'm used to 4*/5* hotels, when on personal travel I tend to stay in the lower end of the market! My boyfriend and I have been on a 2 week holiday starting in Singapore then on to Malaysia and then back, I decided as a treat and an end to our holiday I would spend some of my air miles and book this hotel - like others I was enchanted by the infinity pool and architecture of the hotel. We initially booked one night although ended up being in Singapore for an extra night, we couldn't get an additional night at the Marina Bay Hotel and ended up staying at the holiday inn - Orchard City three times less in price ten times better for service!!What was good about the stay?The rooms are big, even our crappy motorway running through it room (more on that later)Fantastic amenities you could leave your toiletries at home and you have everything you need. Free wifi!!!!THE POOL IS AMAZING the views breath taking and plenty of awesome photo opportunities - even when the storm came in this gave us some fantastic photos with the heavy clouds and contrast of the sun!We didn't queue for check in, I guess we got lucky as we did see lots of queuing going on especially after 4pm.Now this is where my good list ends and my what isn't great about this place starts!We arrived early since we had to check out of the holiday inn at 12 we figured we would try our luck and worst case store our luggage and do some shopping. We were greeted speedily and told there was no room available but we could still access the pool and we would be contacted as soon as a room become available - I was impressed, this is great service I thought and we headed off......well I continually checked my phone, no call it got to 3:30pm (check in advertised as 3pm) still no call we went back to the desk and were informed we have a room for you (why didn't they call us) we were at the lobby in tower 1 so dragged our luggage to tower 3 (our choice from the reviews I didn't want to wait 40mins for our luggage I wanted go go swimming)The lobby is rammed with people and a description I read of it being like a bus station with better toilets is accurate, there is no personality, I've had better service at other huge conference/exhibition hotels this hotel could learn a lot from the Westin!We arrived at our 2nd floor room in the third tower I have to admit I was gutted and knew our view would be terrible but sucked it up since we were insistent we checked in, as we made our way to our room we realized it was still being cleaned, I can not stress enough how polite, efficient and friendly the cleaner was, she apologized a hundred times and speedily finished up so we could move in. This was a better prospect than trudging back to the check in desk through the lobby again!Our room was big but the view was of the motorway running parallel to the hotel, lorries, buses, cars all day and ALL night the window sound proofing is not adequate AT ALL!! We had no sleep not only because of the 24 7 traffic but because the pillows sink to nothing once you lie on them we don't fly until 11pm and we are shattered already and sleep deprived and I paid a lot for this privilege!We spent a lovely afternoon around the pool, if you are looking to relax this isn't the place for you, whilst the view is breathtaking there is a constant stream of guests coming and going taking photos etc we were like tourists so I'm not complaining about this but worth knowing if you want a chilled out private stay.Dress code is strict here and I was constantly confused about what is/isn't allowed where they are trying to set a \standard\"" yet there are tourists  everywhere and it is enforced inconsistently.I called the priority line to check where we could eat our breakfast I was told the club on the 57th floor - I was concerned about dress code so called again to be told I was not able to eat there I needed to eat in RISE in the lobby in tower 1, either was fine with me, however this demonstrates previous reviews about lack of staff knowledge, training and inconsistent service. We headed to RISE I can only describe this as a rugby scrum breakfast experience. If you're lucky enough to not need GPRS to find your table then look forward to constant traffic around your table. There is no refresh of coffee or tea, long lines for eggs, my partners beans, sausage and hash brown were cold. We had a better choice and better quality at the holiday inn the day before. Not enough staff to clear and serve, our dirty plates were left on our tables, this is the worst buffet I have experienced in all the hotels and countries I've stayed in!TV choices are rubbish - no Star TV mainly news channels, no DVD player or iPod docking station so you can plug and play movies!I've written so much and still have so much I could say that is wrong with this hotel and we haven't even checked out yet! But my final bullets are these:This is a Vegas style hotel trying to be a 5* luxury hotel if you want luxury, decadence and service DO NOT STAY here if you want to experience the pool then you will have to!""",379
MBS,3,“Could have been excellent but there is serious invasion of privacy”,"Stayed at the grand room on a Friday night, which offered a spectacular view of the city. It was great to wake up to a beautiful view of the city. The room amenities were mostly great, but the pillow was way too soft for a really good nights' rest. I went with my cousins, and some of us woke up several times in the night.Our bathroom was huge and had a view of the scenary outside. So we had a good soak in the tub, while enjoying the scenary. What a relaxing bath (or so we thought). On our way back to our hotel after breakfast the next day, guess what we saw? Our bathtub is totally visible from the corridor (see pictures)! (My room was the corner unit) We were totally shocked at the poor and inconsiderate design of the hotel! Most importantly, people could have seen us when we were happily soaking in the tub! This is ridiculous! What is the point of designing such a bathroom when there is totally no privacy? Best of all, when we were totally oblivious to the invasion of privacy because we couldnt see the corridor from the bathroom. From the corridor, we could also view the bathroom that was 1 level below us. OMG... How did they get awarded 5 stars???The facilities were supposedly good. The infinity pool, gym etc. But the pool especially, was way too crowded and looked more like a public pool and there was no way that you can swim. But I cannot deny that it offers a really good view of the city, and lying at the beach chairs to read, suntan, or just to enjoy the breeze is really enjoyable, except that most of the chairs are taken up anyway.In short, it's a good place with nice facilities but the crowd makes it less enjoyable. And we left the place feeling pretty troubled about being seen from the corridor, because each of us soaked in the bath for quite long. I think MBS needs to review on their infrastructure and service to address the problems faced by myself and some of the reviewers here, if they want to strive for excellence. Otherwise, there are really nicer and more value for money hotels in Singapore.",209
MBS,2,“Be careful that they don't overcharge you!”,"The hotel is nice and new, lots of facilities, rooms are large by Singapore standards and of course it is convenient for the Casino and associated restaurants. Views from the top are superb.But on my last trip the hotel overcharged me - due to long lines at the check-out desk (a common problem by the way) I was advised that the bill would be sent on to me by e-mail. It was .....and on reviewing it.... it was obvious that I was overcharged by Marina Bay Sands by almost S$ 300-. This needed explaining to them via an e-mail and a lengthy phone call to Marina Bay Sands. My credit card account was re-imbursed a few weeks later but without any interest or recognition of the costs I had incurred because of MBS's error - this despite the delay in reimburing me. The overcharging was really sloppy and had I not detected it I very much doubt the hotel would have picked it up.My advice? Check your bill carefully when checking out at MBS. And don't accept their advice to have the bill sent on by e-mail if there are long check-out lines; if MBS overcharge you it isn't straight forward to get them to accept and correct this.",171
MBS,2,“Does not deserve 5 stars”,"I just spend a night at MBS and I am VERY disappointed.The room was nice, but when we went on the roof terrace to eat, we couldn't have dinner. We were said there was a party. In a five star hotel, people should be warned when they will not be able to eat in the sky garden (the reason why we booked at this hotel). If we had been warned we would not be abble to eat on the sky garden, we would have booked somewhere else.So we had dinner in our room. It was cold and the food was very bad (dry meat).I had written two emails because it was my husband 40th's birthday. But the hotel didn't do anything, not a single word or even a candle on our desserts.The pool upstairs : amazing view but very crowded. To summarize, MBS is more like a production line than a 5 star hotel providing personnal service to its customers - which one could expect, regarding the price of the room.",317
MBS,3,“I had been transferred 5 times when calling this hotel.”,"I was given a recommendation to view the promotional rates shown on their hotel website.It was quite a good deal so I decided to contact them by phone all the way from Japan.Reservation line picked up and I inquired about their package deal on whether the rooms are available on the dates I'll be in Singapore. I got transferred to the next person, so I repeated my query. Got transferred again, repeated myself again. This had repeated to the 5th line till I lost my patience and told them off that they're wasting my time and phone call. Then they told me that the room is not available for that rate. Even if that is promotional price, the rate is still pretty ridiculous to me. You can get much better hotel services with that price.I then booked my room through Agoda since that was available. Upon check in, I made my complaint to the Front Desk and they apologized. They upgraded my room to a junior suite which was better than I expected. That very evening, when I came back from dinner, and slipped my hotel card in, all the lights went off. No power! I called the hotel to get someone to come and get the power back on. We waiting for 40mins. 2 guys came and got the power back on but not all the lights were working. They told me if they wanted to troubleshoot, it will take probably the whole night. This would be a waste of time for us but at least it would be nice if the hotel can change our room. I guess that was not on their mind. Though room and facilities are fantastic, service is not 5 star hotel standard unfortunately. Being transferred 5 times is a big disappointment for me. This is the first and last time I will be staying in this hotel with my family.",447
MBS,3,“Be sure this hotel is what you want from Sinapore.”,"We stayed at this hotel in November 2011, just got round to writing his review.First of all we love Singapore, been 3 times before , is my favourite city in all the world.Favourite for many reasons of safety, lots of things to see and to do. Exceptionally clean!!!!Buzzing city and wonderful skyline. Has gone expensive over the years especially alcohol.Since we last went the whole of the marina bay area has been developed. The Marina Bay sands hotel is a hug part of this development. An amazing building, very spectacular to seeand encompasses a huge casino, very vagas style. Look on line to see the hotel and the amazing structure that dominates the whole bay area We were on floor 42 and had amazing views. On the top floor is this amazing infinity pool, bars and restaurants which again is a spectacular sight to see.The cons ..... This is one busy hotel, huge huge lobby with soooo many people there, if not resident they were coming to look, as I say an impressive building.Because of all these people it was very very busy, unorganised and to me felt like an airport departure gate!, The hotel seemed to be struggling and the whole thing was a free for all.This is a 5 star hotel but to me is nowhere near it. Long queues at check in, even longer queue s at breakfast and again like sow sort of a scrum. Not what you would expect from this standard of hotel. Very noisy, and sooo many Chinese people keen on gambling and the casino was full, gosh the money transactions in there were frightening.We didn't eat other restaurants there, mainly as the settings were all wrong.The infinity pool was amazing, but the general public can go up to have a look and that would have been enough as it's impossible ro enjoy a swim of any sort there as it is FULL of people a creaming and shouting and cameras everywhere , just chaos!,, a visit would have been enough for me.Then we tried the bar at the top of the hotel a few rimes and were rolls it was for a private function!,, Having stayed at 3 other hotels in Singapore, the mandarin, raffles, and Shang ri la, the marina bay sands is just no where near those places in terms of service and hospitality and all that is expected from a 5star hotel and the exceptional management that is recognised world wide from Singapore. Marina Bay is busy and brash and casino indulging , if this is what you want then ok, but you will share this hotel with what seamed like half of the Chinese world!,,,",56
MBS,3,“Highly over priced but terrace pool is some spectacle”,I wanted to visit this property since really long and finally managed last december.Must say loved the terrace pool and the time we spent there. It feels awesome on the top but difficult to stay during evening hours.But I would think twice before staying next time as i found it very overpriced. One time is must.,117
MBS,3,“Average for the price that you pay”,Nothing special other thn the pool. We celebrated my birthday here. Even though they know its y birthday. they dont seem to have perks of me. I mean even a low-class restaurant have offers for birthdays. The pool is always tooooooo cold. I was shivering all the time. The attendants are mostly talking to each other. I think they lack training. The room interior is spectacular. But pls be mindful of the fridge. once you take out anything from it..you will be automatically charged. I was charged for that juice that i did not drink. There was a warning sign on the fridge which was not very noticeable. Even the receptionist did not warn us about it.,198
MBS,3,“Over-priced”,"My family tried the premier room for a night. They initially put us on the 5th floor which was then moved to 10th floor upon my request but I was really hoping for even higher floor for the view. The hotel lobby was really crowded with guests. The premier room was average in standard. The 2 double beds provided were barely adequate for 2 adults and 2 children. The beds were also not as comfortable as they seemed to be. The only consolation was the large bathroom but the amenities were short and had to be requested. The Sky Park's infinity pool is one of its kind for the breath-taking view and certainly worth a visit. The pool was again crowded with guests and the pool water was really chilled for some reason. Swim board was not allowed so my son couldn't enjoy the pool much. Breakfast was included and we picked the Chinese restaurant. The food quality was average and it was rather warm with the morning sun shining on our table. Overall it's not a family friendly hotel. For the S$400 (~US$320) charged for one night, I would rather spend it some where else next time.",228
MBS,3,“First time visitor”,"It was our first time visit to the hotel. High expectations were abound. I called a day earlier to have an early check in if possible. At the check in desk we were told that we were to be upgraded from the Grand Room to the Orchid Suite. We were excited and accepted the upgrade not knowing anything about the room location. To our disappointment when we we got to the suite it was located on the third floor and facing the highway. Even with the windows closed and curtains drawn you can still hear the traffic noise. The view itself was not spectacular. We called to ask about a room change and they say they will try to accommodate. Till the point we were about to check out no calls we made to tell us about the situation with our request. The only saving grace with this visit is the swimming pool on the 57th floor. It was an experienced. To those who visit the hotel in the future be wary of upgraded room. Be sure to ask the level the room is at and if you are facing the sea, ask whether you can still hear the traffic noise. All not bad with the hotel, the shuttle service was fantastic, friendly drivers with smile on their faces and the Sweet Spot had fabulous cakes and breads.",163
MBS,3,“Staycation at Marina Bay Sands”,"We had a two-night staycation at the hotel. The impression that my family gets is that the hotel generally lacks the personal touch that smaller hotels tend to be able to provide. The checkin was quite fast despite hearing many complaints about it. So I guess the hotel management must have made improvements in that aspect. The staff in general are polite but you do not get the feeling that they will go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. The housekeeping staff, however, are more professional. Response was faster and they try their best to please. The view from our room which overlooks the bay was good and of course the view from the skypark is not to be missed. As a Singaporean, I do hope MBS can be a favourite hotel of travellers. Hope the management will see that the staff especially those at the checkin counter are better trained and that they are sincere to all customers including locals.",357
MBS,1,“BEWARE OF THE ROOM DEPOSIT CHARGE!!”,"I booked 2 rooms at the Marina Bay Sand in January 2012 when I visited Singapore in January with my wife and parents. We stayed for 2 nights. When we checked in I was asked to pay a deposit for the 2 rooms, the deposit was the same amount as the total charge for the 2 rooms for 2 nights. I paid by AE card and I was reassured by the staff that the deposit will be refunded upon check out. On the day when we checked out, there was a long queue at the check out counter. While we were queuing a female front counter staff approached me and told me that she could assist me in an \express check out\"", she asked me to hand over the rooms' keycards and she assured me that the deposit will be refunded into my AE card. We were in a hurry and she looked trustworthy so we gave her the keycards and left. I waited for 2 months for the refund and sure enough it didn't come. I made a long distance phone call from Australia and a front counter staff told me that she wound look into it and confirmed with me by email, the email didn't come. I called again after 2 days and another front counter staff promised to check and return by call, she didn't. At the end I was so worked up that I had to escalate the matter to the manager and yell over the phone to get a proper response. I was then told that it might take up to 2-3 weeks for the process to finalise. By this time I was so dejected I wasn't sure I could trust any of the staff anymore. I am so disappointed with this Hotel. The staff are so unreliable and I was let down repeatedly. I felt utterly helpless and angry with all the \""lies\"". I wish to report this in as many social media as possible to caution fellow travellers, beware when you are asked to pay a deposit for your room in this hotel, you may never get it back again....""",167
MBS,2,“Incapable to manage changes”,"Me and my parents booked a room for 3 (a double room with an extra bed), and it's incredible how much they could mess up because of the extra 1. At first when we arrive there were no extra bed, and all the itens (robe to the pool, flip flops and shampoo kit were only for two - I complain because they charge extra for it). And call the service so we could have the robe to go to the pool, after 30 minutes waiting (30 minutes for a robe), we gave up and asked for a guy in the corridor, to solve the problem he gave me a dirty robe (probably the first one he found). And the fact that it charges a lot for internet and breakfast, althought already quite expensive, make it looks stingy. Wifi are usually free in most of cheaper hostels. But we stayed there for one night because we wanted to swim in the pool and we want to experience it.",82
MBS,3,“it is an amazingly big hotel!”,"having money does not mean that person has manners. that's what happened in the children pool. some people washed their child crocs sandal and spit. the hotel is not cheap, so having money is not everything. however, the club is perfect! so i have a mix reviews. one is good and one is so-so. and the spa is marvelous! must say their signature package is one of the best that i have had, and i am a spa junkies. it is recommended.",150
MBS,3,“Much Too Crowded...”,"It is all about the building itself and the famous infinite pool. But this is a really crowded place. REALLY CROWDED. Fun wears out after a while when trying to relax at the pool (cold! Better have your dip during the evening when the crowds go away). During the day the pool area is noisy, cramped, full of people just wandering around taking pictures, no way to get any peaceful time there. Breakfast is another crazy experience. Industrial scale.Check-in and check-out were very efficient despite the huge queues. Overall I had some fun there with my wife but would not do it again. You can do much better in Singapore. Besides, the only thing you can't do at MBS while staying in another hotel is swimming on the pool, all the rest is open and you can visit the Skypark and dine at KuDeTa anyday even if not a guest.",96
MBS,3,"“Spectacular Pool, mediocre room cleaning”","This is the perfect example of a well thought out hotel: it has a nice design, gorgeous rooms, it is connected to conference centers and a huge shopping mall, it has a great location. And the pool is the most awsome i've ever seenThe only downside we've experienced was the room cleaning service. In 2 days out of the 5 we spent there, they hadn't showed up to clean our room not even at 5PM!!! And even when they cleaned the room, it was probably the worst cleaning of all 5 star hotels we've been at.",45
MBS,3,"“all in here, a city of its own, but rooms are very... standard”","It's a nice huge complex where you can get everything from a concert or play to Hainan chicken rice, to Prada to GAP. The restaurant has a nice buffet dinner and lunch. the pool is AMAZING. but the room is shockingly small and very... standard.",177
MBS,3,“Double Celebration/Nightmare”,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4days last 2010 for a double celebration, his birthday and our 25th wedding anniversary. I booked the Orchid Suite and a pick-up limo service from them. Lo and behold upon arriving at the airport, there's no one at the MBS reception desk, no limo service, so we took a taxi going to the hotel and upon checking-in they gave us a room to which i presumed was the Orchid Suite. The room is big but the balcony is dirty, the lounge chair inside the bedroom has seen better days. I can't complain at that time so as not to spoil the reason why we were there in the first place. Good thing the hotel staff were polite and courteous. Server at the Skyroom was great, their bellhop and housekeeping at the 17th flr. And BTW, upon checking their website the room they gave us was not Orchid Suite and they charged me for an Orchid Suite..FYI.. I did complained, but fell on deaf ears..no actions/compensation taken.. too bad..",156
MBS,3,“fairly expensive hotel with impressive building”,"if only I staying one night in MBS that was enough to give an assessment of this hotel. Quite expensive. located on the edge of the harbor. If you want to get a good view there is an additional price for this, and so-called panoramic room. Ordinary room .. not as expected. Rooms are very simple to 5 * standard hotel with a shower without a bathtub, not suitable for children. Just as entertaining hotel.Only for business as it comes casino hotel.The architecture was amazing, with a gallery below features the famous brand goods.Breakfast is very poor to 5 * standard hotel, because there is not much options.Staying in a hotel with a price of USD. 360 more, then this is a once only experience. More to enjoy the beauty and amenities offered better pay $ 20 only, if no other purposes or just want to know.The rest is nothing special as far away from anywhere.",1282
MBS,3,“Not that great”,"My visit to this hotel did not get off to the best of starts. Arriving tired with a 4 year old and my husband following the next day on a different flight I was greeted with 'You can't check in because the booking is in your husbands name and your name hasn't been included'. When asked what I should do I was informed 'You'll need to contact him and have the booking ammended to include your name'... Errrrm not exactly a practical solution. When I persisted stating I was in possession of the booking confirmation e-mail and as he would be arriving the next day I couldn't really see a legimate reason for not letting me check in another member of staff finally intercepted stating I could. After going through the check in formalities I was then informed a room wouldn't be available for 3hrs. No offer of stowing luggage was made or suggestions as to how we could pass the time. I asked if we could use the restaurant at the pool level. I was then given a complimentary lift pass but no instructions how to get there. I was starting to get seriously exasperated ( probably because of fatigue) asking on what floor was the pool, where were the lifts, can I ???? etc. on getting into the lift with a stroller, luggage etc I found the lift card didn't work arrgggh. Fortunately another client very kindly assisted me to the pool and security were nice enough to give me access to the pool area which is strictly reserved for guests with working access cards. The pool has been described as the best hotel swimming pool in the world personally I think that's an unfair accolade it's a one of a kind pool. It is located on the 57th floor which means you are so high up you have an unobstructed view of the cityline but the pool itself is a pretty average infinity pool. If you take away the view it's long, narrow and if busy very crowded due to the lack of space.The staff at the pool were very accomodating on our arrival which made me feel a lot better. They readily helped with our belongings getting myself and my daughter settled. We had lunch there which I thought was very good, quickly served and more reasonably priced than I was expecting. I was however concerned by the life guards supposedly on duty. In the 3 hrs we spent at the pool neither one of them actually did any life guard duties. I counted 15 toddlers in the pool at one time and neither one of them had a clue as they were more intent on talking to what appeared to be a lone single female. That said the next day there was a life guard on duty who took his resposibilities a more seriously and did pay attention to what was going on and enforced pool regulations appropriately.When we returned back to reception to get our room the procedure was pretty quick, again however I would have to point out no one offered to assist getting our belongings to the room ... Not exactly a 5* service. The room itself was spacious, contempary and well equipped with free wi fi. My only critism of the room really was that there was only a shower in the bathroom, the wi fi had a tendency to go offline and house keeping had failed to remove two pairs of dirty socks left on the balcony by one of its previous occupants but I considered these minor things.I e-mailed my husband to let him know of the difficulties we had experienced checking in and unknown to me he contacted the hotel directly and spoke to the duty manager. I later received a message stating that as an apology we had been offered a complimentary breakfast the next day... A small gesture but an acknowledgement that maybe things could have been handled a little better.I called to check where we would be able to have breakfast the next morning only to be told but your package doesn't include breakfast madam.... Even after trying to explain that the duty manager had supposedly updated the records to state one was included I couldn't get anything other than I'm sorry madam. Later it transpired that the manager had credited a $100 food and beverage voucher for me to use at the hotel. Sadly by the time I found out it was too late for me to really benefit from it as I had been paying rather than signing in the outlets. I had a continental breakfast for $12 by the pool which I considered great value. It included a hot drink, a fresh fruit juice and 3 bakery items. It was a busy morning however and the service wasn't close to what we had experienced the day before. The drinks arrived and 20 mins later after asking I was still waiting for the bakery items. I thought the breakfast really suited adults but not so much my daughter so I asked if it was possible to get something from the pool menu or pool restaurant for my her . I had hoped to hear something along the lines of course or as least I can't promise but I'll ask if it's possible. Instead I was very bluntly told no the menu isn't available until later and the restaurant food isn't served in the pool area. When I insisted that they at least ask before declining my request they agreed... Apparently it wasn't possible but they did bring two complimentary croissants for my daughter.After breakfast we returned to our room to find the key card not working. Rather than going all the way to the lobby I called reception on the house phone and asked if they could assist. I was asked to wait outside our room and someone would come. Some twenty minutes later I was still waiting so I went looking to ask a member of house keeping to assist. After confirming our details we were let in the room. Another 20 mins later whilst in the shower I could hear the door bell ringing and someone shouting security. In the end I had to get out of the shower and go to the door because it was evident they weren't going away and I was pretty sure they were going to enter the room.The location is in a part of town I really love. I'm not a huge fan of spending time on Orchard Road. I think if you spend a day there you've done it so to speak. I prefer to be close to the water where there is easy access by foot to The Esplanade, Suntec, Marina Bay, Millenium Walk, Raffles City, Boat Quay, CBD, If you don't want to go to these places and prefer to be on Orchard maybe it's worth staying a night or two out of your trip to experience the casino and the luxury shopping/restaurants at Marina Bay Sands before going somewhere else.Rating this hotel is difficult for me. I think there has been so much hype about this place that you'd expect everything to be perfect and it isn't. The rooms,location,food are 4/5* but the overall service is inconsistent. The service by the pool was excellent one day but when busy not so great the next. My dealings with reception even on check out left me with little desire to ever return. I'd like to believe I was unfortunate in my experience but for the money I paid I know I can stay in other hotels where I will get CONSISTANT service and better value.",159
MBS,2,“Double charged for half the room.”,"Last January 2012 I decided to treat my family with a stay at this hotel, so I did the booking online from the hotel's website for a quadruple room, that was advertised as twin queen beds, enough for my wife and 2 kids.Then I received the credit card charges alert on my mobile, twice!I called immediately to Visa and they confirmed that the charges were done by the hotel.Then I called the hotel, they didn't show much concern, and after insisting many times they promised to credit back in \one or two weeks\"".It's been already a month and nothing happened. I sent numerous emails, called them, but at no avail.Also, when we arrived, the provided us with twin super-single beds, barely enough to accomodate us. Whe I complained, they just said what it is advertised is on best effort basis.It is really annoying and dissapointing that a so called landmark for Singapore shows so little respect for their customers.""",347
MBS,1,“What they dont tell you in the brochure”,"have Just spent a weekend at marina bay sands, one word to describe it awful there are far better hotels in singapore where they appreciate your custom without going here, the infinity pool is fantastic you can't take that away from them , also the service at the pool and the gym are excellent but thats where it ends, We stayed two nights in a deluxe room, parked under neath the hotel, which is miles to walk to the reception certainley no good for disabled or elderley persons, which they ahd the audacity to charge 52 dollars for parking there all this and after paying over 1600 dollars withjout breakfast fro two nights in a sub standard room, aklso the bar on the 57th floor at the evening you have to pay to enter even though your staying at the hotel, breakfast on the first morning was totally spoiled by a waitress asking if we would share our table not once but three times again that is not included in the price it was 89 dollars, the sghops are fantastic but not assosciated with the hotel, the show wicked was brilliant but at 800 dollars for tickets i would expect this again on the Sunday night this was empty, so on the Sunday night by the tiome we got back from the show and arrived at the Sky bar which you did not have to pay to enter ( note we did not have to pay to enter the Ku de tak bar either on the Sunday but declined) there were tables reserved with no one sitting at them, so we stood enquired about food told there was none, so we jumped in a taxi went to clarke key where the drink was half the price and we got exellent food, if money is no object t4ry the Copthorne, the fullerton or the pan apcific all hotels where i ahve recieved first class service as the Marina bay sands does not want your custom, sorry they do wnat your custom but want to provide nothing for it",302
MBS,3,“Beautiful but not value for money”,"Got a room last Saturday to celebrate wife's birthday. Both of us are busy during weekdays so I thought a one night stay at MBS would be a treat for her. Supposed to checked in at 3 pm, and at 4 pm our Deluxe City View room was still not ready, despite them hurrrying the housekeeping department a few times. Upon expressing my displeasure, the clerk offered to give me dining credits of $100 and a late check out till 1 pm instead of 11 am the next day. At almost 4.45 pm the room was still not ready. We were both very upset. By the time we checked in, it will be evening and we wlll have to check out even before we had a chance to explore the premises! One of the staff then offered to upgrade us to a Premium Deluxe City View room. The room is beautiful and the view of the city skyline, simply gorgeous. We made our way up to the sky park. It is stunning. However, any chance of swimming in the Infinity Pool at the top of the sky park was dashed. The pool was extremely crowded. We did not bother to return with our swimming attire.Besides these and the casino (which we don't frequent), the entertainment options are a little bit limited. The Shoppes are beautiful but on the high end side. A few train rides away and one can get much more for far less at any of the city's mega malls. I paid more than $550 for a night stay and they do not even throw in complimentary breakfasts! Overall, it is a mixed feeling our stay. It was meant to be a luxurious 'staycation' for my wife and me. But I suppose we got off on a wrong footing. Pity.",260
MBS,3,"“Amazing hotel, however it is easy to fall through the cracks”","My wife and I were in Singapore on a 24hr layover and since it happened to be my birthday we decided to splurge a little by staying at the Marina Bay Sands in one of their Premier City View rooms with dinner at Ku De Ta. We took the very convenient airport shuttle they offer (highly recommended) to the hotel and upon arrival were unable to receive help with our bags. No big deal. We got our luggage up the escalator and arrived in their massive reception hall, it was impossible to determine where to exactly check in. With two large suitcases and two backpacks in tow we walked around the hall a bit until a friendly concierge from one of their many restaurants pointed us in the right direction. Once we managed to check in, they had our bags brought up; at no point did anyone explain the various amenities of the hotel. Fortunately the hotel has a 24hr hotline you can call with any questions (i.e.: how do I get to the roof deck pool, are reservations necessary for breakfast?). In the U.S. I would call this experience typical, however having stayed at several upscale hotels in Asia I'd call this service sub-par. It is easy to see how one can fall through the service cracks at a large place such as this, it is simply too large to take care of each guest! That said, the room itself was majestic - everything about it. We quickly forgot about the service and admired the view of the city!",399
MBS,1,"“HORRIBLE - THE WORST PLACE, WORST VALUE FOR MONEY,”","Don't eat by the pool, unless you want to get FOOD POISONING!!! The worst hotel ever. After less than 2 hrs at the hotel (while eating a salmon wrap by the famous infinity pool on the 58th floor), I got a horrible food poisoning. This ruined my entire holiday - my one night in Singapore - which I spent in my room, sick as a dog. The hotel staff, while some were helpful, did not admit the hotels fault (and at first tried to suggest that I got food poisoning from food other than theirs - which is not true, since my friends and I had exactly the same breakfast the morning before we arrived to Marina Bay sands). They then, did not want to admit or take responsibility, because my doctor diagnosed gastro (which is caused by poor food handling). He gave me a shot, to reverse food poisoning though. When I said I wanted to complain, I got 100s of explanations of why they can't admit their fault etc, so I hung up. I got a complimentary room service - which included asian dishes with chilli and other stuff which you can't eat when you had food poisoning. I got fed up, and asked for Gatorade (because I needed electrolytes) and toast - they took 40 minutes to get that, and called me to let me know that they \ESPECIALLY\"" went out to buy the Gatorade for me (to show that they cared. I did not at this stage).If you want to waste your money - then go to this hotel. the only thing to see is the pool. But try not to eat there. They said they have 2 food hygienist to oversee all the food, however, I don't see how its possible to oversee all the food in the hotel which caters for over 5000 people! Also, the Ku De Ta restaurant at the top is v.overrated. My friends who visited it (I had to stay in the room, because I was sick), did not like it. Hence, choose OTHER hotels to stay in Singapore. This place is too big, inefficient, impersonal. The check-in/check-out takes ages, because of the cues. The rooms are very basic. There are no lights on the balcony (there is a hole for it but no lights). No seats or table on the balcony. It feels like its still under construction.""",169
MBS,3,“Fine but just a bit 'meh'...”,"I stayed her last spring with my fiance and we both agreed that in the future we'd rather stay at the Fullerton as we have been in the past.There isn't really anything wrong with the hotel as such; we were 'upgraded' to a junior suite which was all right; the gym was good; the views were fantastic and the pool was amazing. However; the hotel is just too big and impersonal for it to work. The check-in was lengthy but not disastrously so, the food was okay but with the plethora of excellent food outlets in Singapore there is no reason to spend ones money in the hotel and the pool-side drinks were extortionate. Ultimately our stay was blighted by a doorman on the pool deck mistaking me for a prostitute when arriving for a night cap with my fiance and my future mother in law in tow! The offense! We complained and received an apology from the management but, needless to say, we won't be back after that...",404
MBS,3,“Disappointed experience”,"During a short trip to Singapore, I had the chance to stay at Marina Bay Sands.In my opinion, there is no second chance for a first impression and the check-in was a disaster.I had my reservation made through a travel agent. At the reception counter, we have to wait due to the queue. I do understand that I have to queue when this hotel accommodates 2000 rooms. But, there is a but, I was unlucky with the receptionist which was the worst in all my traveling experience. It was all messy, the communication not clear. Then she told me it was fully booked that they have to change my room type which I don't mind so I wait 10 minutes, then she told me no sir u don't have to change coz we got your room. I said fine, after typing for 15 minutes more on the computer she told me again sorry we cannot find your room. Its almost 45 minutes that I was in front of her. I asked if I could talk to a manager, because I was tired, and want to rest. she told me sorry sir the manager is not here for the moment. I just had a quick look at the reception and I noticed that other staff with different uniform where standing behind the counter and to me were managers. I asked her who are those people there? She even didn't reply.I was really upset and I couldn't talk to her anymore and let my friend handle this check-in.At the end ( 1hour 25 minutes) i got the room that I had reserved. Tower 3, 6th floor the worst room location, not the tower location the room itself. Close to the other side of the building where you can 24hours car traffic. I was so happy to staying and it turn as a nightmare.I was expecting that in such establishment promoting themselves all around the world as the \place to be\"" in Singapore would do something. Nothing. Have been traveling a lot in asia, worst service ever, even guest houses have better service in Singapore.Either recruitment is a problem or the management, I won't blame this young receptionist that seems to not receive any training.Room was ok, I found some hair in the bathrooms and mini bar.I hope that my next month stay over there will give them the chance to change my mind regarding that place.""",169
MBS,3,“Second rate at best”,"We decided to have a staycation while in Singapore and booked a night at the hotel after seeing the wonderful views from the swimming pool on the top floor. The service was far from what we were expecting considering the huge cost of stay per night. Just checking us into our rooms took a good 45 minutes and the room we had was smaller than what we had been expecting after seeing pictures of the place. The room was also not up to our standards of cleanliness, with stains both on the carpet and on the couch. The view from the top deck of the hotel was everything we imagined and more, however what really spoiled it for us was the huge number of people in the pool and people walking along the deck of the pool watching us like something out of seaworld. In short I think that the hotel is definitely over hyped and over priced and don’t think we will be coming back any time soon.",197
MBS,3,“Beautiful Hotel - but average service”,"This hotel is truly enormous and while the ground floor lobby area felt like a busy train station, the rooms were well appointed and fitted out to a high standard. In particular the bathroom was first class with lovely large shower, and thick bathrobes provided. The pool on the roof is superb, and was perfect for a refreshing sunrise swim before starting the day. (Note it's not heated, so can be pretty chilly)However, I found the service wanting given it is a 5* hotel. I was travelling for business purposes and after a long flight arriving early in the morning I wanted to check-in, drop my bags and have a quick shower and go to the office. I arrived early, so it was fine that my room wasn't ready. But this process took almost 2 hours and I didn't get any shower as the queue to use the day showers was too long. There were not enough staff on the check-in desk and there seemed to be problems with every guest. On returning after my days work, I had to queue for a further 20 minutes to get a porter to bring my bags out from storage.",207
MBS,2,“Average and avoidable”,"A well below expectations experience. The myth around the MBS had built anticipation for the experience which reality belied. Check-in was a disaster with me being asked to wait 1-2 hours for my room despite the hotel having been informed of flight times etc 2 weeks in advance of arrival. The room was ordinary with stained carpets (probably coffee/tea or wine stains around the fridge area and the desk. The food was less than average quality and hugely over-priced in restaurants. One restaurant had a cover charge of S$100/- with no reason for it ... the food is awful and the service atrocious. This last was the clincher for me ... I have never stayed in an upmarket hotel with worse service than the MBS. The staff are rude and speak poor English with no interest to serve customers. They seem to be imports because in all likelihood Singaporeans are over qualified for service level jobs. It was a nightmare get the room cleaned or extra water placed in the room. The redeeming feature was the gym but the spa was again a disaster -- dirty towels strewn around, showers not functioning, overflowing urinals ... simply ghastly. Singapore offers better options. Suggest you take them. I will.",435
MBS,3,“OVERPRICED AND VERY IMPERSONAL”,"Stayed here for 3 nights in February 2012.We booked our Club City View room direct with the hotel.AIRPORT TRANSFER - We were collected from the airport by hotel limo, which was not there when we arrived. We had to wait nearly an hour at the airport, very bad start.CHECK IN - Arrived at the hotel at 19-00 where we had our bags taken from us and told to make our way to the check in desk. This was very, very busy, but no problem as we had VIP check in lounge access, so we headed there. Our room was supposed to be ready for 15-00 hours but the receptionist couldn't find our room and it was not ready at 7pm!!! After 15 minutes checking in we were given our key card and told of our room. Very poor check in and collection.ROOM - Our room was on the 49th floor out of 57 in tower 2. The room cost nearly £500 per night and was large with superb views of the harbor. But it had no style and the interior was modern with no finesse.SWIMMING POOL ON 57TH FLOOR - WOW!!! Absolutely amazing.HOTEL LOBBY - Like Billy Smarts Circus. Talk about chaotic, it was pure madness, like being in a shopping center over xmas.HOTEL BARS - We used the hotel bar located opposite tower 2. For 2 draft beers and 2 diet cokes it cost nearly £20 UK money. Rip off or what!!FACILITIES - The hotel has a museum (Titanic exhibition), Theater, exhibition center, shopping mall, food courts etc etc. It is truly massive.OVERALL - I was disappointed with this hotel because it lacked any personal touches. It just seemed like every person through the door was looked upon as a cash machine and the hotel did everything it could to encourage spending rather than making sure the customer was happy. The hotel is a great concept but just went a bit too far.TRANSFER FROM AIRPORT - I was told at the hotel reception that I would receive my 120 SD back because the car should have been there to meet us and we had to wait nearly one hour. I have paid this 120 SD on my card and am waiting for it to be refunded. At the time of writing this review I am still waiting for my refund which I was told I would get.Would I stay here again? - NO, I would rather stay in the nearby Manderin Oriental, Fullerton or even the Pan Pacific.Tip for the hotel management - Improve your customer service and be more personal to your customers.",179
MBS,3,“If you are into gambling and shopping for luxurious item this place is for you.”,"As the title mentioned aboved. This hotel is non-targeted for business stay at all despite being a 5 Star and well known hotel. The service is really dissapointing, for instance:1. I booked the Clubroom which suppose to come with a Nespresso machine. I called them to ask where is the machine. Their answer was it is only available to \Suites Room\"". And guess what? I later found the machine hidden in the cupboard that is with the safe. Their information is totally unreliable.2. I called them to help me collect the Hotel postcard from my room to post it. They told me they can't estimate the price to post the card because of the measurement? They don't know their own Hotel Postcard measurement???3. Check in time is totally terrible.If you are looking for a hotel that provide great service, this hotel will not be for you.If you are looking for a hotel for the convenience for gambling and shop for luxurious goods, then this is for you. Lastly, I will definitely not stay nor recommend this hotel to anyone.""",630
MBS,3,“Urbanathlon weekend”,"Just returned from 2 nights stay at MBS, was there to participate in the Menshealth Urbanathlon race and wanted to try MBS. From previous reviews, have read that sues can be long for checkin and breakfast etc.., service not personal, compared to other hotels... so tried the club room with Bay view... when we arrived on Friday night, at about 9PM, went to the counter for checkin. no sue, so was quite relieved. Lady receptionist checked us in, but never really identified that we were club guests....(the day after, i saw there was another VIP lounge for Club or Suite guests). Took awhile for the receptionist to find the room.... told us room wasn't ready, another 15-30mins..... NOT ready at 9PM???? So, i insisted for her to find me another room, which she eventually did.We had the room on the 45th floor which was huge and beautiful indeed... very impressed, and the view is one to experience. No complaints on the room and internet was free and quite fast. The amenities was quite weird though, very chinese influenced, probably to cater for the thousands of chinese tourists.... but to be honest, looks cheap compared to other aspects of the room. And the shower head was also cheap looking compared to other Hotels i have stayed in.Every morning, didn't receive any newspapers.... for a paying club guest, one would expect newspapers to be includedbreakfast was at The Club, on 57th floor. As expected, the view at the top was beautiful and services at the lounge was good and staff were very helpful. Couldn't rate the breakfast downstairs and wouldn't want to assume that services there would be bad, so wouldn't comment.Swimming up at the top is an experience to have at least once... but would recommend to come early, as its packed after 8am...the great thing about staying at the club floor is also easy access to the Sky park at anytime... so good for spending time up there. Ku De Ta restaurant is quite nice; it was our second visit and great ambience for a lovely dinner. the Salmon main dish is delicious!The worst experience while staying there would be the \priority service\"" button available to call. So, i tried it to ask if MBS had a box for packing;First try calling at night, was put on hold..... waited forever... decided to hang up. NO ONE returned my call.SECOND call the morning after, tried again... after speaking to a lady, was told it was from the Business centre. I asked what are the sizes available, and she said \""SMALL\""... didn't give me dimensions. So, i said if someone can send it up for me to see... so she said she will send someone up...... waited again forever... so i decided to call for the THIRD time. eventually was informed that they were TOO BUSY to send the box up... great service indeed.Eventually i ended up going down myself to look at the box. after paying for it, i asked if someone could send the box up, as we were going out.... was told they couldn't. whatever.. i told myself.All in all, staying here is an experience one must try, but because of the sheer size of the property, personal service is very much lacking and do expect to wait a while for requests. That is why i rate the service at 2 stars considering the magnificence of the property itself... i could get a lot better, personal service at our usual Hotel choice in Singapore at half the price. Apart from the service standards, I had a wonderful time spending the weekend with my dear wife and also the great race! Would i stay here again.... yes, but only to bring my children once for them to experience it too...""",97
MBS,3,“Beautiful infrastructure but one of the worst service quality in town”,"I love Singapore and visited it hundreds of times but it's the first time that I stopped at this hotel. And the last one. It's quite sad that such an amazing infrastructure deserves such low level quality in terms of service level : it starts with a long queue at the reception desk, very slow check in, and ends up with no professional staff at the bar upstairs, on the \main deck\"" of this vessel-designed terrace (\""sky park\""). The hotel is worth a visit but other five star deluxe downtown offer a much better service. A pity.""",190
MBS,1,“5 Star hardware with 2.5 Star software...”,"What a magnificent statement of architecture although it looks like 3 monoliths of tombstones to the Chinese. What were the designers thinking??? To top it off, the Chinese restaurant in the lobby have 3 gigantic white pillars shaped like Chinese lanterns which coincides with the colour of death or funeral for the Chinese. The main lobby felt like a station terminal rather than a luxurious hotel. Just felt short of 'class'.Apart from that, the service was way below par and ill-fitting uniforms made it worse. The Coffee House Rise could be renamed as Fallen as food was mediocre at best with many dishes not replenished. Staff were overworked with not a smile on most faces.For a brand name like Sands, the room looked plush initially but very soon, simple practicalities such as proper plug points were missing. For example, the kettle was there without any socket to plug into.Although the double doorway into the bathroom was nice, it meant knocking and blocking against the shower door just behind... Again, what were the designers thinking???For almost S$700 a night, there are far better hotels in Singapore around the Marina Bay area.",73
MBS,3,“Dont Understand all the Hype”,"OK the architecture is impressive but the lobby has the feel of a bus or train station, there is absolutely no where to sit whilst you wait for your room. The rooms are nice but very very noisy so sleep quality quite frankly was terrible. Overall it is just not worth the money. It seems like it is set up purely for the groups of gamblers and everything else is just a compromise.",78
MBS,3,“One & only attraction: 57th Floor Borderless Pool”,"My family spent approximately SGD840 (USD633) for 1 night stay at this hotel during school holiday. No breakfast, poor customer service for Asian guests, ordinary hotel room, no bathtubs, MRT station not ready in operation.One & only attraction is the borderless swimming pool located at roof (57th floor) which is extremely nice to swim at night (close at 11pm) and early morning (open 7am) whilst watching the morning & night cityview of Singapore.Frankly speaking, not worth for value.",351
MBS,1,"“Great building, but poor service”","It was one year ago we stayed at Marina Bay Sand, and this hotel becomes a topic when we talk about \good hotel\"" and \""bad hotel\""; unfortunately this is the \""bad hotel\"", and the \""worst hotel\"" we every stayed. Having said that, the hotel facility was new and nice. Yes, the view was fantastic too. What bad about this hotel was service and how they structure. The bad experience start from the moment of arrival at the airport. The hotel provided the free shuttle service from the airport. It took us more than 1 1/2 hour to go to hotel as the shuttle stopped every single terminal to wait for other guests, whilte it took us only 1/2 hr when we took the cab to the airport. The shuttle bus dropped us off at the basement carpark. We had no idea where to go, no staff or signs to direct us. When we managed to find the check-in floor, there were such a terrible human traffic; they were the tourits who came to visit the hotel for shopping and the swimming pool on the top floor. No porters were provided, and we had to drag our huge luggages, looking for the check-in counter. We finally found the check-in counter at the tower 1. Check-in was done, but then our room was appointed Tower 3! The lady at the check-in counter even did not ask us for porter service. Again, we had to fight in the trafic with carrying huge laggages all the way to Tower 3... We were so exhausted that we did not want to communicate with any staff....The swimming pool was great, but I would not want to swim there as the place has become a tourits atraction with lots of non residence taking photos.The hotel provide great view, and shopping area. However, they do not provide the type of service I would expect from this level of hotel. It is not worh the money to stay. You can just visit the hotel as a visitor to experience the view and shopping.... I hope something has improved since then...""",329
MBS,3,“A mass-producing hotel with no soul or spirit”,"Everything about this hotel is big: the 3 buildings are big, the lobby is big, the nearby Shoppes mall is big, the rooms are big, bathrooms too, and of course, the infinite pool on the 59th floor is also big. But, I was not impressed at all. On the contrary, it felt more like a hotel for the masses and with little interest or care in the individual guest. With more than 2000 (2500?) rooms, this place is really meant for mass-production (Casino guests I presume). The rooms are gigantic, but with very boring colors and already dated furniture. It somehow just appears cheap, everyting. Especially the lighting above the writing desk provided a very awkward lightning, and added hereto an armchair which fit more into a living room than in an office, thus, impossible for any business traveller to spend meaningfull time for work here. But, admittedly, the bathrooms are great and spacious. But, the main attraction of this hotel is without doubt the infinity swimmingpool on the 59th floor. And yes, as you step out the elevator, you do feel overwhelmed by the stunning views of Singapore and the ingenuity of this pool terrace. The pool water, though, was chilling cold, so fast laps were required! Overall, I left this hotel with a feeling of \now I have tried it\"" but will most likely not return. The free airport shuttle bus (every 30mins) is a nice feature, but the impersonality of this place makes me prefer other establishments in Singapore. I noticed how slow the check-in process was, luckily we had no long waiting lines, but example our request to have late check-out was granted with just an additional hour from 11am to12pm! The connected Shoppes mall offers dining possibilities in an impersonal foodcourt environment down in the basement. If you want a taste of Singapore at your hotel stay here, chose a different place (my favourites are Mandarin Oriental or Hilton on Orchard Road -great location).""",334
MBS,1,“5 star ???? more like 3 star experience”,"I've shopped around MBS and I must say the area appears very luxurious and so I'd wanted to stay in the hotel to experience it further. But after paying for more than a 5 star price tag on a hotel room in MBS, I was totally disappointed. Firstly you arrived at the lobby with no staff at the door, so with bags and luggage, I'd to push open the huge glass door by myself. and to my horror, there were a long snake of queues for check-in. Apparently there were a lot of tourists, and mostly chinese and taiwanese tourists, looked like a group package tour, the whole lobby looks like you'd just arrived to a typical 3-4 star package group hotel. there were lack of staff, and long long wait for a room. finally got a room at 4pm!!! staff were very rude... we went to the roof top swimming pool, and the staff rudely asked for our passes to enter. a \Welcome\"" would be nice. instead of a \""you cannot enter if you don't have a pass\"" look. the toilets in the pool area are horrible. it's ok if it is labeled a 3 star hotel but it's not! the door looks worn out and \""cheap\"", and the architecture is weird, you gotta walk a long corridor to reach the toilets. and the stairways to the toilet were abit steep and not steady, with wet carpets. it all look like some cheap hotel with no staff cleaning and maintaining the place. Anyway, the swimming pool experience isn't any where nice... but that's not the hotel's problem.. more a cultural shock. The group of chinese tourists spit into the pool water and around the seats. Last but not least, the breakfast buffet is also below standard. a simple roti prata was full of flour , thick and oily. the whole presentation looks like you just enter 3 star hotel , again. I'm so sorry MBS, that you do not take pride in yourself.""",75
MBS,3,“Overrated”,"Marina Bay Sands is a spectacular looking hotel with fantastic infinity pool on 57 floor. great city view from the room to singapore skylines.free airport shuttle and free internet. thats about it. Nothing special. No greeting and smile in check-in and check-on. staffs are helpless,soulless, arrogant attitude. Go stay there for 1 night for the experience. There are lots of hotel in Singapore which is 10 times better than MBS and cheaper. St.Regis, for example.",75
MBS,3,“Overrated & Expensive”,"I stayed here in January 2012. I was interested to know what's all the hype and buzz about MBS Hotel. It's pretty overrated and expensive. It's worth the stay only for one night but for the room rate, you could get a better deal with great facilities elsewhere. Reception was not friendly. Stiff and no smiles. However, I have to say that being able to stay on such a high floor, the view was amazing!",110
MBS,3,“Overrated and overpriced”,"I stayed here during my honeymoon for 2 nights. For the price paid you would expect a very high level of service. Check-in time was long and staff were generally not friendly or helpful ( although they have a bunch of standard learned phrases which they say to appear helpful...) we felt like another number. Our non-smoking room stunk of smoke, which was 'solved' by the friendly staff by installing an 'ionizer machine' which really was a placebo. The pool is unique, and the spas were excellent on 57th floor. Not relaxing though as there are so many people about. It's a 3 star hotel with a 5 star pool.",242
MBS,3,“Overcrowded Hotel”,"My colleagues and I visited Singapore last year and stayed in two hotels over the week-long trip, one of which was the Marina Bay Sands. We stayed here just for one night , just wanted to get the feel of staying in a luxurious property. Our booking was for a premier room but we were given the deluxe room instead. We only realised this after returning home.Well, the hotel was spectacular from the outside and the infinity pool was exciting and made good photos at the sunsetting time and night time when the city lights came on.But the queue for check-in was horrible, we waited for nearly an hour and were told to come back to get our room number because no room was ready yet for us. Somehow our booking got mixed up and we ended up with the deluxe room.There was not much of a service at the hotel, basically you have got to help yourselves. We didn't get any help from the Chinese ( I mean, mainland Chinese) housekeeping maid when we could'nt get into our room. She just told her that we had to go downstairs to the reception counter to have our problem solved. When we went downstairs to try talking to one of the reception staff he told us to go stand in the line.It was a good experience to be staying in a property of this scale and standard but that was just about it.",1015
MBS,3,"“Huge, crowded, happening...don't forget your camera when you go to the roof”","I just stayed here for 2 nights in one of their deluxe rooms, with the city view. I was on a conference so paid SGD300 for a \special rate\"". My \""special treatment\"" (read on) was probably a result of this.I was initially told when I reached the hotel at 11am (checkin time is at 3pm) that I would get a \""full sea-view\"" and that they would try their best to get me a \""higher floor\""; when I got back at 4pm to get my room, I was given the one facing the city, on the 18th floor. The hotel has about 55 floors or so. So neither condition was fulfilled. I took consolation from the fact that the sea-facing view is actually not very nice - the sea is a little bit of a distance and the intervening space is taken up by construction of the new marina area. On the sea itself, you have the view of container ships. The city view is a lot nicer and dynamic, though busy for the eyes. And apparently, I was \""upgraded\"" to a city view since they told me they charge more for that view.The room was huge, well-appointed and modern - curtains (both day and blackout) opena dn close at the touch of buttons. Usual flat-screen tv, huge king-sized bed (that I had asked for - so I guess I did get one thing that I asked for). The bed was comfortable. The room had its own coffee tea facilities, iron and board, sitting area with a divan and work table. All expected at this sort of a hotel. bathroom was huge but no bath tub, just a shower area. It surprised me there was no rain shower and just a head extending out of the wall. The hot water regulator was tight and would probably require you to have significant muscle mass to turn. The usual \""Paiza\"" amenities were available. So, in summary nothing special.The breakfast was crowded; first time in my life I actually had to queue up to get a table. But to their credit, they have an army of hostesses who will take you to your table. The spread was ok - both local and international fare. Service crisp. Cappucino ok. Freshly squeezed juices. Forget about the hot eggs line...you could probably lay an egg yourself waiting for your turn. In summary, nothing special. If you really want to eat something nice, take a walk over to the foodcourt in the convention centre across the road where I was told the food is good (and a lot cheaper!).The hotel complex (it's 3 towers) is huge, busy and buzzing. There are at least 3 ways to get to the other side (the Casino, Convention Hall and Mall). The closest is from Tower 1 - where you can just walk out and cross the road. The other ways are underground - slightly longer walk. In case you take the train (MRT) to the hotel from the airport, there's a station right underneath the hotel - so very convenient. It enters the hotel between Towers 1 & 2. Taxi lines - outside Towers 1 & 3, with the former being the busiest. Tip - if you have booked in Tower 3, no need to get off at Tower 1 and check-in. You can get off in Tower 3 and check-in there, though the counter is smaller and lines likely to be longer. The walk between Towers 1 and 3 is say...150m. It takes 3-5mins.The star attraction is of course the top deck (known as the Skypark). There are some lifts that go direct to the 57th floor and others you can change/transfer on floor 34. Access is by key card once you reach the top i.e. for hotel guests only. It wan't as crowded as I thought it would be. It does take your breath away the first time you see the infinity pool, seemingly disappearing over the top of the building, with a view over the Singapore skyline. The pool is long - it stretches over almost all of the 3 towers so there's ample room. It's open from 6am - 11pm. The other side of the building has heated jacuzzis looking out over the sea and the sunset. There's a children's pool above Tower 1. Some eating options although you need reservations - I went on a Monday night at 8pm and they were turning people away. Tip - go at sundown and sunrise to get some really scenic views of Singapore's skyline...but be aware the pool is not heated so it can get a little cold at that time.Would I stay here again - I might. It's really not my kind of hotel. It's big, busy and you can never seem to get anything done without getting into a queue. However, just for the infinity pool and views, I would recommend a night's stay; it seemed a lot of people and tour groups had the same idea. On another note, their key cards were super-sensitive and kept getting de-magnetised. And every time I had to get them re-done, I would get 2 or 3 in return (i.e. the staff knew the problem with the key cards). In short, I now have the largest collection of key cards from a single hotel ever. Tip - you can also get your key card re-done from the business centre (there was one in Tower 3 where I stayed) which had nobody...as opposed to getting in line behind 15 people at the checkin/checkout counter.The staff - really nothing great at all. There was one guy who very helpful when I checked out - he came to help with my bags. He showed me how to check-out using the TV remote in 2 simple steps. (Yay! I skipped the queue downstairs!!) Of course you need your credit card to be registered with them and be comfortable with the bill coming in on email (which it did immediately). Other than this guy, other staff seemed \""busy\"". I suppose they could not help it.Hope the review was helpful :)""",110
MBS,3,“Disappointing!”,The hotel is architecturally very interesting. The Skypark is well worth visiting: great all round view of Singapore and the infinity pool is very special. But this is not a luxury hotel: $500/nt is way overpriced. The rooms have very standard run-of-the-mill type of furniture and furnishings: not luxurious and certianly not 5-star quality. The sofa sags and the upholstery is worn. The carpet can do with a steam clean. The hotel is geared to tour groups: no personal service to speak of. Even the public spaces are unimpressive: the interior designers could have done better: may be they were restricted by a budget restraint? Will not stay there again.,90
MBS,2,“Beautiful hotel to visit....poor service”,"Well...it is a big beautiful hotel with enough restaurants and mall areas. I admit pool area is just fantastic. We were in a big group with children but all the rooms were on different floors and different wings. Surprisingly, floors on the same wings need different elevators to connect which became a pain to coordinate to say the least. Food is very expensive. Service is hopeless and room service could take hours to arrive. Regret spending the money there. Smaller boutique hotel would have been a better option for sure.",532
MBS,2,“Maybe if they get it right”,"I had heard many nice things about the hotel, and my wife was in Singapore on business, and decided to to extend the stay over the weekend.. should have extended the stay , but at another hotel.. check in was a nightmare, I had booked two nights, however they had split the reservation into two records, telling me that one night i was going to stay in one room, and have to move the next day, not happening I told them, after 20 minutes, it was resolved, and we were off to the room. A very nice size room, but that was about it, an Orchid Suite, based on the hotels description and the price, was expecting more, the room was dirty, no water kettle, no iPad docking station as promised, no clock, basically nothing but some standard hotel furniture and some dust bunnies in the closet. The SkyPArk is nice, but dirty, very very dirty, no care is taken into the upkeep of the area, and if you want a glass of water, forget it, $6 SGD will get you a bottle of the hotel distilled tap water, while on the subject, water will cost you everywhere, if you stay in a suite, you are entitled to breakfast at SKY57, when we asked for water, we were told that we had to purchase it, purchase a glass of water, to take two aspirin, yet the ice coffee and tea were on the house, does not make a lot of sense. When we went to the Chinese restaurant in the lobby, we were charged for water also. tap water, not bottled water... The hotel boasts Celebrity dining, not worth the effort, nor the price, the hotel is too big, staff does not care, partly because they can not communicate, or have not been trained properly. From the first night of our stay , to the morning we were checking out, someone on our floor had placed garbage from their room in the hallway near the elevators, so for nearly two days, not a sole had bothered to remove it from the hallway, it just sat there. It took two and a half days to get a manager to talk to about these problems, but in the end, she was the nicest person i had spoken to, however, basically, unable to do anything other than to tell me things will be better next time.. funny, the bellman told us most guests are very unhappy with the service, and many of the same issues, and so did the taxi driver, oh yes, the taxi driver, the hotel offered a hotel car, however we waited 15 minutes outside the hotel for the mystery car that we were told was on its way, we could not wait anymore, so we took a cab, however as we pulled away , there was the car the whole time , just not were it was supposed to be, as out taxi driver said, it was maybe a 6 star hotel, but i have stayed in Hilton Garden inn's which were cleaner, and more friendly.. maybe they are making so much money in the Casino, they just do not care.",623
MBS,2,“Extremely Disappointing and Overpriced!”,"I have traveled all over the world, and even though I only got a deluxe room, it is the most expensive room that I had paid for. As a birthday gift to my mother, I wanted her to stay in what was supposedly the best hotel in Singapore. That being said, it was EXTREMELY disappointing to find the room as ORDINARY. I have paid for better quality hotel rooms in Europe for less than a third of the price. Even their sister hotel The Venetian Macao was leaps and bounds better at a much lower price. The room even had a vandalized desk which had not been cleaned, and the hot shower handle was difficult to manage. The pluses were the soft beddings and pillows, and of course the use of the infinity pool and the views. But since I can get the views by paying entrance fees to the Skypark, that would still not justify the cost of an ordinary room.But what I am truly shocked was their low level of customer service for such a pricey hotel. I have stayed in some hotels with less (but still) overpriced rooms, yet they made up for it with excellent customer service. Marina Bay Sands did no such thing. I had made it a point to email my preference for separate beds way beforehand, because as an adult male I did not want to share a king bed with my mother. I know such preference is still subject to availability, but upon check-in the front desk representative said that my booking was still lodged under a king bed -- which meant my previous correspondence with them was totally disregarded. They tried to put us in a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed, and just transfer us next day, which I declined due to the inconvenience. To be fair to them, they did offer to upgrade us to a suite -- but still with a king bed and a sofa bed. Some might think I'm stupid for refusing, but at 2am I did not want to have paid that much to sleep on (and possibly even assemble) a sofa bed. Then voila! -- miraculously there was an available deluxe room with separate beds -- which made me wonder why they made us undergo such a hassle in the first place. They must have found my email the next day, because they tried to compensate by leaving a birthday cake in our room. But the damage to our holiday was already done, and the cost of the cake does not in any way compensate for the hassle during check-in and the overpricing.Moreover, their free shuttle from the airport was also problematic. There were no signs regarding its pick-up location. The information counter people at the Budget Terminal had conflicting info on where it was (in fact, a number of airport personnel didn't even know where it was or if there was one), so we barely missed the hourly shuttle. And to top it off, the next shuttle was even late. We noticed that it did not wait more than a couple of minutes for passengers, so it will pick you up only if you are there EXACTLY at the irregular time when it passes by. Also, I guess late check-in guests do not get complimentary drinks the same way as during the daytime.When you pay that much money for a room, you expect to get a really good experience (and not just rely on the views and the pool) -- which is something my mother and I did not get, even though I had notified them beforehand about her special occasion. I recommend that they spend more on upgrading their customer service training.",136
MBS,2,“Bling Bling”,"OK everyone is enticed in by the pool ontop of the hotel - which is stunning. But guess what - extremely busy! The hotel was obviously set out to impress and it does. However it struggles to deal with the masses. Issues: 1. Room given - not as advertised. Whilst complaining, noted that we werent the only unhappy customers. That said, management relented and we had a huge room with stunning view. 2. Breakfast location bit of a frenzy - be prepd!3. Checkout - chaos!!That said - pros: 1. Pool!2. Underground shopping - very convenient. 3. Staff all very helpful. Overall. 1st impressions count Im afraid - when we told local friends where we were staying - they rolled their eyes!! Nuf said! Stay somewhere quieter and come for a swim - although not at sunset!",287
MBS,3,“Overrated”,"Did not have to wait long for a room during check in at 3 pm. However, staff were not friendly. We had booked and requested for a double bed deluxe room but were informed that there were none available. She told us that a club room was available but only with a king size bed. She could obviously see that there were 3 of us; 2 adults and 1 13 year old yet she said that there were no extra beds and her attitude was take it or leave it ;saying that its an upgrade already but no club benefits are included. What is really annoying is that we did not ask for the upgrade and yet we are subjected to this condesending attitude. Why bother to upgrade and tell u that u are entitled to nothing and did not even offer to see if she cld get us the extra bed for our following 2 nights ? The king size in the club room was only a standard king size and we spent an uncomfortable night squashed together, in the end one of us slept on the sofa. The pool was too cold to swim in even though it was really quite breathtaking. Hotel was perpetually crowded and there were no seats in the lobby for you to wait for friends. We were told by the concierge that there was no need to book for the evening buffet but it was full when we arrived at 7pm. Room size was adequate but not one would expect for a club room. It is totally unlike the luxury one would expect for a Sands hotel. It is just very ordinary. I would say that we were quite disappointed.",331
MBS,3,"“Top view and spacious room, forgett about the rest”","We went here in January 2012 because of the pool and skypark. Check in took 10 minutes and we were leaded to our room, all neeed information was give to us, so far so good. he view from our room above the skyline wa brilliant and the room very big. This was all OK. Trouble started in the next morning when we went to breakfest. There is a dining area in the first floor ( lobby hall ) of the hotel, first of all you have to wait untill a place is free and then you get seated somewhere in an area which is the total opposite of being cosy, it is horrible and not suitable for a 5*-Hotel at all. If you go there I would take my breakfest elsewhere. It is expensive and ... as I said forget about it. The Skypark and the pool on the 57th floor offers a stunning view over the city, but thats it, food at the resaurants is overpriced and the pool over crowded which is no wonder as the hotel has 2000 rooms ( as far as I know ) so again it is more mass tourism than a 5star-feeling. Now to the very anoing point: the rooms are - even if the hotel is very new - already shaby and the building materials used are cheap, they only look good on the first view, the rooms are not cleaned properly, we found sauce on magazings in the room, the carpet was dirty and the desk full of ink, couch was dirty as well, so this is digusting. We were happy to stay here only 3 nights, this place is never a 5-star hotel, I would even not rate it 4-star. I stayed last year in the mandarin oriental and this is much better value even if the hotel is muach older than the marina bay sands.OK, the views are stunning, the rooms big, but thats it, the rest is simply unacceptable.",1098
MBS,1,“HORRIBLE check in that destroyed the overall trip”,"Visited Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights during early January. After landing at Singaore Changi Airport, we decided to take a cab to facilitate our trip to the hotel.We're a family of 4, and I was travelling with my parents and older brother. We booked 2 rooms, one king size bedroom and a two double bed bedroom.There were a lot of check in counters, everyone seemed well groomed and friendly. After a short line up we gave our hotel reservation reference and online receipts which clearly states what we have booked: 2 rooms. One with a single king size bed, and the other with two beds. For some odd reason, they couldn't find one of our rooms. It took them a good 30 minutes of 'checking the system' to finally 'find' our missing room.The first room (king size bed) was located in Tower 1, 40th floor while the second room (2 beds) was in Tower 1, 30th floor. We decided to go the the 40th floor together first to check out the magnificent view. Unfortunately, the magnetic key cards were not working. We tried both key cards, and the little light on the doorknob will just flash yellow and remain locked.We decided to use the service phone by the elevator and explain our situation. After 10 minutes, a hotel staff (hotel porter I assume) comes out of the elevator and walks us to our room. He tries our keys (and of course they weren't working), he inserts the new key and opens the door. However, he walked in with us and just stood there. I might have been extra sensitive, but the 4 of us (entire family) felt quite uncomfortable and it definitely felt like he was expecting a tip from us. There was NO WAY I was tipping for a service that was originally the hotel's fault for giving us faulty keys! If anything, I would have expected the hotel staff to apologize on behalf of the hotel for causing us this trouble and wait time!The room itself was nice, surrounded by brown and beige tones. All amenities were fully equipped (a digital locker, complimentary coffee and tea, bathrobes, plenty of towels, all bathrooms amenities full. etc). The bed was cleaned and even though the carpet (being light brown) looked a little dirty, complimentary sandals were provided.We then head down to the 30th floor to check our second room. This time the magnetic keys worked, BUT it was somehow locked from the inside!!! What could this mean??? The only explanation we had was that there was already somebody in our room!!! Confused and upset, we walked over to the service phone by the elevator and explained our situation. The person on the phone asked if he could send someone upstairs to do an ID check. I was baffled by this, since this will not solve anything! She checked the room reservation and of course the names didn't match, meaning that there was probably a mistake by the check in staff where they gave us an already occupied room! I was getting quite frustrated by now and extremely tired since I traveled over 10 hours prior to landing at Singapore. The phone staff tells us to go down to the check in counter again. I was perplexed as to the level of inefficiency this Hotel has. I asked if there was somebody in specific we should talk to, but was told to explain the WHOLE story again to the check in staff. Seriously?!?!Fine. We go down again, and of course the lady who checked us in was off duty. We explained our situation to a new lady and after 10 minutes of 'checking the system', she could not give us any explanation of what exactly happened! Not even a 'sorry'!!! She then tells us that there are no more rooms in tower 1 and she could check us in at Tower 2. We explained how this will cause an incontinent, since we wanted to travel together as a family and our parents room are in Tower 1. She couldn't help us with that and just waited for us to agree to take a Tower 2 room.Fine, reluctantly we accepted since I was mad furious and deadly tired. All I wanted to do was to lie down. We receive the key and guess what? Our room is now on the 13th floor! From 30th to 13th! We walked in and realized that the room size is the same as my parents' 40th floor, but when we opened the window, all we could see was the mall's rooftop from across the street. Horrible view.While I was about to drink some water (they had 2 complimentary bottles), I realized that there was a half empty bottle of water on the desk with a different brand. I asked my brother if it was his, and he said no. This could only mean that the housekeeping staff 'forgot' to take away an open bottled of water and left it right in the middle of the desk! Upon further inspection, the cabinet sliding door where the digital locker was located was damaged and it would not open and close properly.I called the hotel again and asked them 'why is there a open bottle of water left by the previous occupants in our room?' I also made sure that they knew the sliding door was broken, so they wouldn't charge it on us as damaged room fee.How could a hotel of this caliber miss on so many level??? check in staff was unfriendly and unapologetic. They were extremely inefficient and could not accommodate us in the simplest terms. Housekeeping staff leaving used bottle of waters behind. Phone operator also extremely inefficient. Hotel service staff showing attitude for a service that should be tipped free and apologetic towards.The hotel itself looked marvelous. The hotel amenities were superb (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, food courts, shopping, casino). But PERSONALLY when I pay this amount of money for a room in a hotel, the most important factor is the room and where we will sleep. The rest (swimming pools, viewing deck, restaurants, shopping) are extras that makes the hotel even better, they are secondary issues to reinforce what a comfortable environment they have to provide us with a care free, comfortable night rest. This point was entirely missed by the hotel so no matter how great their secondary and supportive activities and amenities were, the entire feeling of Marina Sands Bay Singapore was simply terrible. Just terrible.And yes, this might sound cliche, but first impressions are THAT important.",169
MBS,3,“Spectacular architecture and public spaces”,"We stayed 2 nights at the end of a 10 day Singaporean and Phuket family holiday with the intention of finishing our holiday in a spectacular setting. With over a thousand rooms everything can't run in the clockwork fashion as stated but our in room dining was quicksand efficient , beds were comfortableand and the bathroom in our superior room was large and clean. Housekeeping didn 't change or clean used cups and our room smelt of cigarette smoke: we weren't offered a choice of non smoking at check in. We had also requested a two queen option when booking on line as we travelled a ten year old child, but the beds in the room were clearly doubles. The rooftop skyPark and infinity pool are as drop dead amazing as anticipated and the banyon tree health club has excellent views also. Clearly, the reason for booking here is to experience the amazing architecture and engineering: on this scale intimacy and personal room satisfaction would be an amazing bonus.",99
MBS,2,"“At this Price you would Expect something classy, don't!!!”","Check-in Procedure took ages and you have to be on the right Tower. Staff was very friendly during this 30 min.Concierge is very Helpful and quick as well.The questions Start when you get to the room. Why was it built so cheap???The bathroom Door doesn't have a proper stopper and the Door may get open again on the worst Moment.The Airconditioning is the noisiest i ever had, Worse than than the Oldest Hotel in And by the Way, if you wanna enjoy the Pool, wait for Rain....otherwise Good luck!!,Really Not impressed Even if the staff is trading his best.",167
MBS,2,"“Do Not spend money for Club Rooms, Poor Service”","I booked 2 rooms over Xmas, Club rooms about $900/night EACH for 6 nights. Architectural Marvel, but appears to be like a fish market, Noisy. Took me 1hr and 30 min to check in despite checking at the Executive lounge. Rooms were good, Beds OK.The infinity Pool Fantastic but Crowded as. The Club lounge is not a lounge at All. Alcohol served from 5-7PM ( Not allowed a Beer in the daytime!!), then you stand in a queue for half an hour or more and at 7 Pm Asked to leave!!!!. Not a lounge at all but a cheap restaurant with chairs and table only. Cannot relax here, cannot take a drink to the pool - 5m Away. Total ripoff. Took me over an hour to check out, busy period I know , but put more staff on.This is a Gambling joint, so It wont matter what anyone writes, But very disappointed. Checked out after 3 nights went to the Ritz Carlton to a real club lounge......",95
MBS,2,“best to look for other hotels”,"This hotel is alright if you just looking to stay for a night.I booked a high floor city view room.Entering the hotel, I find that it was more of a zoo, with so many people around, hotel guests and non guests.Per room there are only 2 bottles of water, and when you ask for more complimentary water, they dont give you,and reason given is that, per room is entitled to 2 bottles.The only thing I liked was the view from Ku De Ta.I would rather splurge on staying at Ritz, Pan Pacific or other hotels.",292
MBS,3,“The pool on the 57th floor is Extraordinary but the service is 2 star”,"We were anticipating our stay at the Marina Bay for 3 months due to us seeing it on the Discovery channel. When we arrived there was chaos and we were unsure where to go. It felt like entering a shopping mall then entering a hotel. We were so unsure where to check in we had to ask several different people before we were led to the reception counter which had at least 30 people in front of us which is very annoying when you are travelling with kids. After around an hour we checked in to our room. The receptionist is very irritated as they can’t handle the volumes of people. The rooms are very well planned and very welcoming. The amenities are standard. However the concierge is excellent as they are very helpful and will help you in any way. In the hotel there are volumes of people so you can never get a personal touch. The rooms never get cleaned unless you call the housekeeping. There is no turn down service, this is not the norm when staying at a 5 star Hotel. The 57th floor is definitely a wow and it has a surreal feeling. When we checked out at 9pm which we had paid for, The receptionist was very rude in saying just remember you will be charged for the night which we were aware of. The receptionist never bothered to ask” Did you enjoy your stay at marina Bay Hotel”. They don’t understand the basis rules of service, “ Look at the customer when speaking to them” . The service is really standard for being 5 star. From all the 5 star hotels I’ve stayed at, this must be the worst ever when it comes to service",57
MBS,3,"“Good architects, average on service”","(+) Stayed there for 3 nights, beautiful & magnificent. (+) Lot of things to do there like shopping, casino, spa, theater, sky lounge pubs etc.(-) Guest have to be on queue for morning breakfast.(-) Too big and commercial, lack friendliness. (-) Not very central, (-) No smoking room available (-) Feeling of staying in a shopping Mall.",309
MBS,3,"“\Good hotel- but .......”""","Completely agree with RONBONW and his review. We stayed at the MBS for 5 nights from 8th-13th of Jan 2012.Yes.. it was a spectacular hotel. The staff at breakfast do their best but with hundreds of people to serve at the same time,sometimes when you were looking for a coffee there was no one in sight.The breakfast menu was extensive and always fresh.It IS a tourist attraction in its own right so if you are looking for a relaxing, quiet place to stay...dont bother...we knew what to expect, but were still blown away by all the people walking through taking photos of you eating breakfast!!Our checkin was not the best experience either. Yes..it was 1am however a smile and general welcome would have been nice. At first our booking could not be found then,we were given no information about breakfast..we rang information and they apoligised....we also questioned the room as we had payed for a horizon PREMIER room and were taken to tower 3 which we believed only accomodates deluxe rooms. On questioning this we were told that there are premier rooms here to. We did not think any thing of this as we had a city view and the room was nice albiet marks on cushions and pen drawings on the desk!!On our arrival home i was shocked when i looked on the web to discover we were NOT given the room we payed for it was not over 40sq and did not have a bath!!! WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!!!!The view from Sands Sky Park is fantastic ..but pay to do this dont stay at this hotel.What a shame as we over all enjoyed our stay here but not worth money..walls thin you can hear next door showering, and some staff need to be more friendly..we had just come from Malaysia where service and hospitality was excellent.",464
MBS,2,“Bad service -will not go again- EVER!”,"I want there with a corporate price, and we waited almost 30 min for we arrive at 4pm which was way pass checked in time hence the queue was not pretty bad compared to what I heard some people waited for 2 hours. Obviously i stayed around October 2011 and only have the time to write the review now...I wouldnt go back to that hotel again ever.The staffs werent friendly at all. Upon checked in, I actually find the hotel lobby so huge that we dont know which way to head up. After check in we headed to the left side of the lobby asking for help and without finishing my question, the \Front Office\"" guy I would say would just point me to find help to the person next to him. I find it very rude, as all i was asking was where are some ATM that I can withdraw from?WHen I was checked in to the room-finally, I found out that the fridge couldnt be opened, hence I phone the operator to check it out. I was told nicely that it will be fixed in 5 minutes...after 10 minutes i called again as it was still couldnt be open and the telephone operator promised to send someone over which obviously noone came. The next morning we went for breakfast, and were wearing our ITB tags, the waitress at the breakfast area told us \""Mam, your ITB colleagues were at the lounge at the back, if you want to join them.\"" then I replied \""nope its ok, as im a hotel guest and I want to dine privately here\"" then she came replied\"" thats fine, then your friends will be at our lounge and you will have to charge to eat here\"". I was like, my accommodation was included with breakfast! I assume she would have my room numbers ready to be called and just cross off our names! Its really unprofessional! The good points are, the hotel views is good and the bell boys were really friendly. The front office person were really terrible! I complained to my friends whom then told me what do we expect, where they are a casino hotel where they only pay attention to players who pay much more than us. I was treated badly there, all the complains I had was not new to the taxi drivers whenever I got to suntec and back. I would say the locations is not that good, we wanted to experience MBS at least once and we ended up taking more taxis more than ever just to get to places to shop and dine. I would have chose other better hotels, its was a bad experience and choice! I have recommended all my friends not to go and stay there!""",276
MBS,3,“No service but great rooms and pool.”,"Stayed here for 5 nights and must say the rooms are nice with great views of the marina, or the sea. The pool area is very nice and the views must be seen Go up there just before sun set and see the city lights come on. Sky bar is also very good, and you can see the water and laser show up there if you can get a table near the side. The mall can be accessed via the underground link found within the hotel lobby. On the down side this is a casino based hotel. Therefore, a lot of people coming in and out, no staff will smile or say hello to you, let alone address you. Check in staff I had were very poor and so were the bell boys. Short staffed i would say for the amount of people. My bedsheets were stanied and that put me off this hotel big time. Good link to the MRT now that Bayfront is open, buy a pre-paid card for $12 at the station as this will save you money on top ups and each journey is cheaper than singles each time, there is however a $5 non-deposit included in the price so only get if you will be travelling more than 4 return journeys during your stay. The wait for the Taxi’s can be long, so make sure that you tell the door staff that you’re a customer, local people also use the taxi queue, the door staff will bump you up the queue. Get out of this place and see the real Singapore as this is very western with branded shops after shops...",85
MBS,3,"“Good, shame about the check in!!!”","first impression was great hotel until i went to check in & waited 1/2hr only to be advised i had to check in at another tower! Smaller queue here but still a considerable wait. After finally checking in we then had to wait for our baggage to be delivered!!!That said, delux room was fantastic, great views, inifinity pool was great & drinks on the rooftop in the evening overlooking Singapore was a highlight.

MBS,3,"“It's an Airport, no, it's a train station, no, it's a...hotel?”","What a nightmare! Hundreds of people milling around, queues for everything, it takes hours to check-in, hours to get the lift, etc. How this hotel could have 5 stars is beyond me! The rooms are ok, bathrooms were lovely(very big) and the room service was good but the level of service checking-in is nothing short of disasterous. We had booked 2 rooms and the second was not ready until 9pm! We are a family of 5 with three small children, they wanted to put us on different floors because they couldn't find the second room(booked well in advance) but in a hotel this size different floors equals different hotels! I would have left immediately but for various reasons could not, but we did leave the following morning(had booked for 5 days) -thankfully!!!!",135
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands.”,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sanda Hotel in Singapore for 6 days, for a short shopping Vacation during 2011. The Lobby was dreadfully crowded and our room was not ready for us. This was at midnight, after a long plane trip, we were ready to shower and go to bed.The Staff were courteous and did try to accommodate us. We were given a food voucher and asked to wait, it would be 1 hour before our room was vacated and cleaned. Fortunately for us, another room was found for us within the hour.This Hotel is very over rated and quite a distance from the shopping malls, especially when it is too hot to walk anywhere. .The bar and pool on the roof was fun, great for a one time only experience. Way too expensive.",990
MBS,1,“Honest But Lengthy Review”,"HONEST BUT LENGTHY REVIEWUnfortunately this hotel was far from our expectations and this is what was endured during our stay.On our arrival we were very surprised to find that there were no electric doors or doormen at the entrance, you had to manually push thick heavy glass doors which we found very difficult.At check in there is no seating for other guests of your travelling party to sit, people just standing around everywhere and certainly there is not enough staff at these counters.I had made my booking for check in the previous day to my arrival as we were travelling all night and wanted our room to be available on our arrival at 8.30am the following day. Check in staff did not check the documents properly and advised me check in would not be available until 3pm it took 3 times to show them the booking for her to understand and an e-mail conversation with the booking company advising our request.The booking was made 6 months prior to our stay and being a smoker I requested a smoking room, I understand this is a request only and not all requests can be met but making my booking so far in advance I thought this would have been met. I am sure other guests that had a smoking room did not book 6 months or more in advance. We had to wait an extra hour or more for this type of room to be available. With this happening we were each given a $50 voucher to use in certain areas of the hotel but we still did not think this was acceptable nor did we use the vouchers.In our package breakfast was included so in waiting for our room we had breakfast and again showing the staff the documentation that check in date was actually the day before we still had problems with them understanding our booking and later that evening we noted this breakfast was charged for. The following morning when we went to breakfast and advised what had happened and the Manager in this section was really good, he understood the situation gave me his card, went to check in and this charge was reversed.The breakfast was fantastic, the quality and quantity of food was amazing and all the staff were very polite, friendly and worked very hard. The first morning we had breakfast as it was a little later in the morning we sat in a bar area and it was a bit difficult in eating as the tables only came to knee height. Although the restaurant was very nice there are a large number of guests at one time for breakfast and everyone talking it gave the feel as more of a cafeteria.In your room the mini bar is weight sensitive so as soon as you take anything from the mini bar you are charged, this is the first time I have ever come across this and I was quite disappointed that the fridge was full to maximum quantity so there was no room to put your complimentary bottles of water to get them cold, we could not buy fruit and keep refrigerated, this is a way of them making more money as you cannot but drinks outside of the hotel and put in the fridge. It was also disappointing that a hotel of this calibre only supplied coffee mate as a milk substitute instead of long life milk, can’t think of anything more disgusting to use and again couldn’t even buy fresh milk to put in the fridge as there was no room.Each time you arrived from the lift it was noisy and once in the foyer it felt like being in a Mall, at times we had to wait 10 minutes or more for a taxi and again entering or returning having to push the thick glass doors. As we were so tired on our arrival we were glad just to get our room but we found the following faults and looking around our room the next day we were totally shocked to what we foundAir conditioner was noisyDesk chair squeaks everytime you moveThe other thing we found annoying was the bathroom light was near the door entrance and the side lamp switches were behind the side draws which were difficult to get to at timesThere was dust everywhere, and this was not just daily dust this was weeks if not months of dust and fluff on the TV side board lip side, glass shelves with mini bar menu and vase, desk mirror frame, window seal.Vinyl on the writing desk drawn onRound table had a burn mark1 side table had a wood missingThe most disgusting thing of all that we found that there were stains on the valances of both beds (pictures attached) all I can say is I was glad we were checking out that day.As I write a review on all hotels that I stay in and this room standard not being acceptable I thought it would be appropriate to advise the hotel of these conditions. I requested for a senior member of housekeeping to inspect this room but no one was available until I advised about my report, after this a member was sent to the room within 15 minutes. I showed her all the dust & fluff & especially the stains on the valances and no commitment was made but on each instance all she advised was sorry Maam and advised this would be passed onto Management. Shortly before checkout a member of Management did contact me but she did not come to inspect the room while we were still there and no type of discount or refund was offered. We were however offered transportation to the airport and again I declined as I just wanted to checkout and arrange my own transport. I have stayed in 3* hotels which are cleaner than this.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",356
MBS,2,“bad check-in experience but nice views”,"We stayed at the hotel for 1 night on 7th Jan. Arrived at 2 plus pm. Thought we could check in at 3pm as indicated by the hotel but was told by the check in staff that the room will not be available for another one and a half hours. However, she said we could check in first and come back for the key later.When we came back one and a half hours later at 4pm, we were again told by another stoned faced check in officer that the room was not ready. We complained that the previous officer had already said the room would be ready by 4pm. It was after much prodding that she called up the housekeeping department to ask. The housekeeping said they need another half an hour more. That means a check in of almost 5pm as it was already 4plus at that time. After a frustrating wait, we finally got a call at around 520pm saying that the room is ready. That is when another hiccup occurred. When I went to collect the room keys, the second check in officer insisted that I have not paid the deposit for the room. My partner had done the check in so I thought that she have not paid that deposit yet. When I paid that deposit and joined her at a nearby restaurant, she said that she had paid when checking in.After checking with the check in officer, they discovered that we indeed paid that deposit when we checked in earlier, except that the previous officer did not key into the system!We finally checked in at 6pm. This was the worst check in experience we ever encountered, had to experience this from a 5 Star hotel is totally unacceptable. There was a crowd at the lobby and the check in staff seemed unable to cope with the crowd. Having said this, to their credit, they agreed to extend our check out time to 3pm. We also enjoyed the facilities and views from our room and the sky deck. But the check in experience had already left a sour taste in our mouth.",19
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands”,"nice hotel, nice amenities, but lousy response from time of call to actual delivery of amenities to hotel room",179
MBS,3,"“MBS, A Grand Hotel but . . .”","Marina Bay Sand is definitely a huge hotel - it's new and stunning. Because of its size, it cannot give you a personalized service. We booked a premiere non-smoking room on-line. The MBS hotel receptionist gave us a room after we presented our on-line booking form. Getting in the room assigned to us, it was obviously a smoking room - there was an ashtray beside the TV and we can smell the cigarette smoke right when we entered the room. (The bellboy was insisting that it was a non-smoking room!) When we checked the room further, we noticed that it was smaller than the one that we got several months ago. Back to the hotel reception area, we were given another room (non-smoking) and the premiere room (bigger than the previous one!). So lesson for the travellers - you must be sure that you are getting what you paid for. Otherwise, you might be shortchanged.The lobby of the hotel is always full of people that you feel that you are in a department store. Lobby is often very crowded.",484
MBS,3,“Overated for a 5 star hotel”,"This was our 6th visit to Singapore and decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights between 3rd and 7th January 2012. We booked the premium room with city views, but when we checked in we were offered a larger room with a separate bedroom and living area (i think it was the orchard suite), but the room was on level 5 and facing the expressway. Since we were a family with 3 children (12, 6 and 3 yo), we agreed to take the larger room even though i was hesitant following reviews on Tripadvisor about the noise from the expressway,When we arrived at the room ti had a very strong smell of cigarette smoke, like someone had just had a smoke in the room. We called reception and they organised for the room to be ionised, but we had to be out of the room for 30-45 minutes. So we went for a walk to the shops and had dinner. When we came back, the room still had a cigarette smoke smell, just not as bad. Nevertheless, we requested to move to another room.We moved to another room on level 6 (one level above), which was the same type of room. This room did not smell, so we were happy....for the moment. Now when everyone went to bed, the reviews came true, the traffic noise was crazy. We could not sleep and the kids stayed up until 3am!!! Next morning we requested another room change to a higher level. We were given a new room, but not a suite, a premium room with city view - our original booking. That was ok with us, as long as there was no more traffic noise and no smoke smell. There was a sofa bed, which was good and the views were great.This was not the end of our problems! My wife had a shower that night, grabbed the towel and after drying herself she realised that there was fish oil on the towel and her body and hair smelt like fish so she had to have another shower!Finally, we had problems with our room keycards, after the room was madeup, we went back to the room and could not open it with the keycards, so had to go downstairs to the checkin counter to get the cards replaced. Had to battle the crowds and wait in line, which took about 15 minutes before I was served.However, not everything was doom and gloom. The skypark pool was amazing and the fitness centre is well equipped.Overall, it was a disappointing stay, given that this is a 5 star hotel and considered as one of the top hotels in Singapore. A bit overrated in my opinion.Not sure if we would stay at this hotel again. Can get the same accommodation elsewhere for much less, or get a better room elsewhere for the same price .",29

MBS,3,“MBS Experience is like gaming in their Casino”,"Just checked out today of an Orchid Suite. And I think after almost 2 years, it is fair for me to finally write a review.Stay just once to experience Marina Bay Sands as Singapore's latest icon. It is a must! But for future stay, there is more value for money in other hotels like Fullerton.Its a massive place and there is too much to write. Bad experience or not, you have to check in to experience it all for yourself. Words alone aren't enough. Just don't have too high expectations or you will be disappointed. Who knows, you may be surprised, the MBS Experience is just like gaming in their Casino.I had 2 excellent stays with MBS and 2 nasty ones.The check in queue system has improved dramatically since. The service standards during hotel opening was excellent but dipped and now has picked up again. The front desk staff are making alot of effort but I can see they are physically drained. I know most hotels use Opera and it seems a breeze but the agents seemed to be having system issues. This disadvantage doesn't allow the staff to focus on the guest but on the system. This is the greatest downfall of MBS as front desk is every guests' first and lasting impression/experience. I really commend them for their effort to please a guest.FUNFACT: Check in on your birthday, they may do something nice for you!Their rooms are generally all bigger compared to most hotels. Bathroom carry a full range of amenities so you can leave home with just a change of clothes. Internet is now free! Finally! However cleanliness standards may be a tad bit low. Sofas look worned out. Carpets need shampooing. Looks like the hotel is 3 times older than it is. Saving grace, the mattress is of top notch quality.FUNFACT: If you are planning a trip after July, ask for Garden View facing to experience The Gardens By The Bay as well as ocean view. If not, request for City View facing at a charge of $50 more.For the best infinity pool experience, go early in the morning or late at night. Spend your afternoon elsewhere! The swimming pool is opened from 6am to 11pm. For the camera shy, bring your shades, everyone is equipped with a camera there!FUNFACT: Only plastic \glasses & cups\"" are allowed in the Sky Park.Even if you don't stay at MBS, visit the Art Science Musuem for TITANIC Exhibition. Its worth every penny especially for the romantic at heart. They hand out a \""passport & ticket\"" to start of the journey to re-live the moments of the Titanic passengers.FUNFACT: All the artifects are retrieved from the shipwreck and find out why the exhibition space smells of perfume!Good luck with your gamble!""",143
MBS,3,“It´s a place that you have to visit at least once if you are staying in Singapore”,"Agree the hotel is huge and always full of people (similar to one of the big hotels in Las Vegas), agree that service is ok but not the most outstanding service in Singapore or similar hotels in Asia (probably because the amount of people in this hotel is amazing) and agree that the pool is always full of people and it is not fully enjoyable............but it is the kind of hotel you have to visit and where you have to stay at least once if you are visiting Singapore!However the hotel is pricy (as everything in Singapore) and they are obviously taking advantage of the fact that you can only access the swimming pool if you are staying in the hotel (you can access the top floor even when you are not staying in the hotel, but you cannot enter the swimming-pool part).",120
MBS,1,“Poor customer service; dont let the pool persuade you”,Travelling to singapore on business. I expect a reasonable standard of service for a hotel offering business services.1. Checkin was spectacularily slow2. Booked room was unavailable as they were overbooked; and they downgraded me! Every other hotel would upgrade you in this scenario!?3. Room was noisy from both the street and lobby guests well into the night.4. Had to then change rooms as my booked room was made available the next day. They couldnt hold both rooms even though it was their fault so i had to essentially check out and check in again. I'm here on business I dont want to be faffing around with the hotel.Back to Starwood properties for me!. No more stays at Marina bay sands!,1353
MBS,1,"“MBS - Poor service, worms & mould in room”","Firstly I must state that I rarely complain as nobody is perfect in this world, but in this particular case I was disappointed with the service to the extent our stay/holiday was essentially ruined and I now feel compelled to share my experience so that management can see their issues at hand.We arrived a few days after some family members. Our family had booked 6 rooms through a friend that is a VIP and Sands have flown them back on their private 747 from Vegas in the past!We stayed from 29th-1st in our room.Upon check in there was no record of our booking, a quick call to the friend who called the manager sorted this situation out however as it was last minute 27th Dec 2011 there was not enough club rooms (which is understandable to some extent)We arrived from our flight at 10pm, got to our club room on level 40+. The rooms are spacious, views are great and fittings were also nice except the sofa bed was out.As there were many issues ill note them accordingly below:1) Sofa bedWe called on the club priority line at 10pm + and asked that the bed not be made and be converted back to a sofa. They wanted to send housekeeping then to sort it out which was nice but quite late and with a baby we just asked if it could be done the next day.The next day it wasn’t made up, but still out.On the 31st morning I called priority line again and went to reception on our way out to sort out the issue and they confirmed it would be done (again)That afternoon we encountered another issue and when the service manager came up to view it AFTER housekeeping had been through we again complained about the sofa bed, so house keeping was immediately called to rectify it.The sofa bed was made but the of the 3 back cushions the middle was placed correctly and the two others were placed on the armrest, with pillows placed where the seat cushions should have been.The service manager didn’t even pick this up... Where is the commonsense & training?Also there was a used tissue under the sofa bed after they folded it up which I had to pickup.Refer to pictures of setup... 2) Baby bathNot a big issue, but might as well highlight it.Called priority line on the 30th morning requesting if they had a baby bath available, the person on the phone stated yes they do but they will check on availability and get back to us. We waited sometime 1 hour+ and called back. The person who picked up this time asked if anybody had called us back? Well obviously not otherwise I wouldn’t be calling right? They said they were all unavailable and we would be put on a wait list. No issues, but it would have been nice if they followed it up rather than us have to. We never got one throughout our stay.3) WORMSDuring and after the shower we noticed small black things around the tiles. On closer inspection they were wriggling and were worms, i counted in excess of 20, they were coming out of the gap between the shower floor tiles.Rather than call and complain I decided to go to reception and mention it as the phone staff are obviously useless.They said they would have it fixed during the day.We return back in the afternoon, there are still at least 6 dead ones lying on the floor!I call the priority line again ask for the manager as this is unacceptable. One of the service managers came up to inspect it, took some pictures and so we complained about the sofa bed so she organised housekeeping to fix the sofa and tiles.She said unfortunately the hotel was fully booked so couldn’t transfer our room.They used a sealer to cover the place where the worms were coming from which made the room smell quite bad, and there is no window for the fumes to escape so we just had to get a high on them.The service manager said its their 2nd NYE and hotel was running at full capacity. My question is, how can you be a manager with such low attention to detail in such a hotel, and moreover if you can’t cope at 100% then why do it???Refer to pictures & video.4) Mouldy accessory boxOn the last night after all these issues, we went to use a cotton bud so opened the box and reached to the bottom where they were, the box was lined with mould...Nice, I mean aren’t these things meant to be hygienic?5) CarpetsNot a big issue but since I’m doing this I may as well mention it. Sitting at the desk I noticed a long hair on the carpet (not ours) as it had been there from day 1, maybe the vacuum isn’t he best but for whatever reason it was there from check in to check out, I was wondering if it would be cleaned but wasn’t holding my breath.6) House staffNow its a known fact that all hotels use foreign labour as its cheaper and Singaporeans won’t do it. When the hotel is running at full capacity during NYE you would expect no less from a hotel of this calibre, but we overheard the cleaner come out of the room on her mobile calling a colleague saying in Mardarin \where are you I have nothing to do\"" Nothing to do????? really??? I can think of something for you to do!These rooms were not cheap at Singapore $450 a night!The communication between staff is utterly miserable, its been mentioned before and its obviously the same.The Sky Park is nice, Club rooms get breakfast on the Skypark, other guests can’t even pay to eat there WOW! But the food selection is 1/4 of that available to all patrons downstairs.Hot food was eggs cooked to order, tomato, beans, bacon, sausages and congee. They had some cereal, toast, ham, salmon, salad and 2 fruits.On the last day 1st Jan I went down to reception and demanded to see the duty manager, I brought up all these issues, and armed with pictures and video went to show her. She initially declined with a disgusted face! I said if i had to live in it then the least you can do is watch it! I asked her if this was a hotel or a camping ground? At $450 a night I don’t expect these issues to surface, i doubt they would even happen in Hotel 81!She seemed very understanding and remorseful on the hotels behalf and gave us 30% off and asked us to try the breakfast downstairs on the hotel.Later in the morning we had another call, I assume from a manager asking if all issues had been resolved. At the same time his mobile was ringing and you could obviously tell he was distracted from the conversation as he had to stop talking to see who was calling.At this stage I had literally had enough of this and said \""yes\"".Seriously I know its not easy to manage a hotel of this size, but if you’re going to put the \""Sands\"" name on the hotel you should protect your goodwill with the same level of service!The communication of this hotel is utterly pathetic, and our NYE was tarnished by the series of events that happened.During one of the conversations to the priority line after the worm issue had been \""cleaned\"" the first time I said if you don’t send the manager up ill post it on tripadvisor, to which I was told \""everybody has a right to express their opinion!\"" so MBS management here it is! I have been truthful and factual, as it stands during peak times your hotel is hopeless!I do not blame individuals but essentially this hotel is poorly managed, I have never ever encountered issues with any hotels at the lower or high end that have compelled me to the extent to write such an extensive list of issues. Hopefully this will highlight the hotel deficiencies and they can do better.""",87
MBS,1,“Pompous without any Character”,Let´s be Honest this is an amazing Property but if it wasn´t for the Skypark on the 57th Floor this is nothing. The Hotel has nothing to Offer except a large Casino and a shopping Mall that has the same shops you anywhere on Orchard Road in Singapore. The Pool on the Roof is really the only amazing thing about Marina Bay Sands but stay at The Mandarin or Four Season and be treated as a Guests should be treated. This hotel is not worth the Money.,70
MBS,2,“Stayed two times but no good impression”,"Was in the Tower 3 in May 2011, low service level. difficult to get a table for breakfast. The city view room is very ordinary. Not worth at all. My second stay was in Oct 2011 in Tower 1. The room is nicer but service was as usually very bad. Waited 30 minutes for my bags to send to my room. Only positive is the visit to the sky Park.",141
MBS,2,“Way below expectations”,"First impressions was boarding the free airport coach, driver said nothing at all not even a quick Hello, on arrival at the Hotel - still nothing said. I had to find my own way upstairs, looked for signs to reception, nothing, eventually found a reception - waited too long and then finanly chekced in. The rooms seem more like 5 years old than brand new. The pool on the roof is certainly great but does not make up for the rest of the Hotel. I had a problem with my TV that took 3 days to fix, I even suggested that my room be chanegd but instead they sent another technician whoudl could not fix it - just to let you know, TV was fixed 1 hour before my check out. There are definately better options for better hotels in Singapoore.",135
MBS,2,"“No Charm, No Class - a waste of time and Money”","I was supposed to stay 5 nights, and only stayed 2 as I found this hotel too unpersonal, with low quality services and very uggly rooms.Ok rooms are very spacious, I was staying on a City view suite on the 54th floor, but they are incredibly baddly decorated... And when I say decorated, I believe they haven't had enought money to buy furniture, paintings and objects. Just a huge suite, with one king size bed, one sofa, one table... and that is almost everything.ABSOLUTLY NO CHARMYes the lobby, and the roof terrace is a unique experience... but no need to stay in the hotel to experience that. Save money, as you won't get more.And I forgot, the worst is that during breakfast I discovered a metalic screw within my muffin... NO do avoid this hotel.",18
MBS,2,“Not a good experience”,"This hotel, Marina Bay Sands is NOT worth the money. Don't ever stay here.U will waste ur money.",366
MBS,3,"“Marina Bay Sands, looks good, however!!!!!”","Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands over New Year 2011/12. Owned by the guy who owns the Venetian Hotel in Vegas, this hotel reflects the Vegas ideology, impersonal and clinical. It is a complex of shops/restaurants/bars and even a theatre. Don't expect personal or attentive service. Breakfast times at the three restaurants are manic, bring sharp elbows. It is architecturally stunning, I agree with other comments re the infinity pool/sky park. The views over Singapore are stunning, Beware of the prices in the Ku De Ta bar adjacent to the pool they are double (£11.00) for a lager) than that at the pool bar. Also we waited 40mins for a club sandwich and Caesar Salad at the pool bar despite asking several times, This is a 2500+ hotel and I appreciate a busy time of year. This was my wife's 50th birthday and had communicated this to the hotel requesting 'city views' which would have overlooked the firework display on New Years Eve. On check in despite our protestations we were allocated a 'sea view; (hotel full)'. Beware!!! the sea views also overlook a 5 lane motorway. The area designated as a patio was filthy, no chair or tables and in any case anything below the 40th floor you were unable to communicate outdoors due to the noise from the traffic below and we were on the 13th floor. The double glazed patio eliminated most of the noise into the room. The room itself frankly for a hotel barely 18 mths old looked tired with numerous marks on tables, chairs and carpets. Also there was a distinct smell of cigarette smoke prevalent and cigarette butts in the window boxes on the patio. It was obvious some people were smoking in their rooms which despite this being (I think) a non smoking hotel and the fact that we had requested a non smoking room just in case. We were booked B&B. Every day we checked our bill and they had charged us for breakfast!!. Every day we told them and every day they charged us again. Please make sure you check your bills. Summary - stunning views, looks good on outside, but fails to deliver on service.",705
MBS,2,“Essentially a $400 pool visit.”,"I wasn't as impressed as I was with this hotel - honestly I've stayed in hotels quarter the price and the stay has been better.Shortly after we arrived, my partner went into the bathroom to go to the toilet, only to find half the bathroom area completely flooded with toilet water overflowing from the bowl, and the previous guests business presumably floating at the top. Completely horrified, we immediately rang the front desk services to get the issue sorted out. My partner told the man on the other end of the phone that we had a dinner date we had to attend so unfortunately we wouldn't be present while they attended our room, to which he was told \No, you must be present in the room while it is attended to\"" - which we found extremely rude and unnecessary considering we had prior arrangement and a booking at a restaurant we didn't want to be late to. The man on the other end said someone would be at our room in 10 minutes at which we would be able to leave. So while my partner waited, I quickly ran down to the restaurant in the MBS shopping complex to tell the friends we were meeting that we'd be a bit late. I returned to the room and my partner was STILL waiting there. By the time I had returned, 45 minutes had passed and NO one had arrived to sort the problem out, and by this point the bathroom and some of the room was smelling putrid. I was so angry I rang the front desk and told the woman on the other end (who could barely speak English) that we had been waiting longer than double the time specified for someone to arrive, and that it was ridiculous that we were told that WE had to wait all this time, let alone at ALL. She then laughed and said that we should just leave and muttered something incoherent and hung up on me.When we returned from our dinner - which we were an hour late to, we returned to the room thankfully fixed. The bathroom unfortunately still smelled terrible. Something else that enraged me is that a note was left which said:\""Dear guest, We came by at 17:25 to attend to your request. Your request has been attended to while you were away.\""What really annoyed me is that it stated that the request was \""attended\"" to at 17:25. I know for a fact that it was NOT attended to at this time due to the fact that this was at the point where my boyfriend was waiting in the room and when I was running around telling my friends and the restaurant what was happening.I resent being lied to by staff who want to make out that they were diligent enough to attend to our request (which was completely reasonable in the first place!)..I have no idea when or how the problem was fixed or why it even happened in the first place - but things like overflowing toilets that aren't attended to shouldn't be happening in a 5 star hotel. I've stayed in $50/night hotels that have had better functioning facilities and more diligent staff. On a better note, the SkyPark is worth visiting. We enjoyed the Infinity Pool and jacuzzis on the roof and the atmosphere on top of the hotel. The restaurants/bars up there are too expensive to bother with.Honestly, the only reason we wanted to stay at this hotel was because of the SkyPark/Infinity Pool and the Casino. My boyfriend (who is an avid poker player) was disappointed that there was no poker at the Casino but found the staff in the place very attentive and pleasant to deal with. While I understand that guests at the hotel should be granted access of the pool - it is disappointing that MBS doesn't designate even one day in which the public are able to visit and have a swim - because essentially most people stay here to have a swim at the pool and to pay at LEAST $400 for one day of that is completely ridiculous considering the rest of the hotel experience is far from being up to scratch.""",123
MBS,2,“Not Queen size beds”,"My husband, myself and our two children travelled to Singapore in July 2011 and stayed here for 5 nights. Our room was supposed to have two queen size beds in it as our travel agent was lead to believe when boooking it for us. When we arrived we found that in fact the room had two king singles not queens, as two pillows side by side didn't even fit across the bed. My husband spoke to the reception several times and they were extremely rude. They said it was all that they had available. They reluctantly supplied a roll away bed but I still cannot get over how rude the staff were at such a prestegious hotel. Would I come here again? Never.",337
MBS,3,“NOT A REAL SINGAPORE EXPERIENCE”,"There's no doubt the architecture is quite unique. Much of this you can experience without staying at the hotel of course. I had to stay here to for the sake of it but my reality is it is over priced and I can see the rates falling once the novelty wears off. In my opinion there are way way better hotels available for the price they are charging. I am rating it as average for a 5 Star hotel.Staying in Singapore I have much better preferences in the 5 star category. Smaller hotels that have a way higher level of service, experience and a genuine Singapore hospitality. Marina Bay sounds service is cold, clinical and inexperienced. The line to check-in was in the main thoroughfare - not in a reception lobby, and it felt more like waiting in line for a low cost flight. There were 40 people ahead of me and it took well over 60 minutes. Totally unacceptable.The rooms are modern 5 star standard. The roof top pool is of course magic, but its crowded with the hundreds of people staying here. Compared to las vegas this hotel is lacking in facilites for the volume of people staying here.I loved the Titanic exhibit at the museum, but of course I didn't need to stay at the hotel to attend. The shopping mall is nice, but ridiculously overpriced. The hotel is off the beaten track, so to speak and I would rather have a hotel in another area that offered easier access to other attractions. The MRT subway in Singapore is one of the worlds best, but no station at/near the hotel.So who is this hotel attracting? People like me who will stay 1 night just to see and a few international visitors. It's main future is the Asian gambler and that's really who they are after. For anybody else seriously look at some of the other great 5 star hotels in Singapore that offer a far better location and a big step up in service.",461
MBS,3,“Nice architecture but worse service!”,"I should have listen to the other reviews and stayed away from this hotel!! I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in Dec and has booked a Premier room which cost slightly higher than the Deluxe room. The booking was made in Sept via a travel agency and both of us had requested the hotel for a higher floor room with 2 queen beds and a city view. Unlike other hotels, I received an email from Sands with a very mean reply simply saying that my request was “noted but no guarantee”.When I arrived the hotel at around 3pm, there was a long line waiting for check in and just realized that it took at least 20 minutes for each guest to check in. So when it was my turn, the lady (Cherrlynn, with a very cool look on her face without any smile) told me that there was only a room on the second floor available for me and if I want to get another room on a higher floor, I had to down grade and take a Deluxe room; if I want to get the Premier Room (this is what I paid for !!) then I need to come back in 2 hours (I overheard that other guests also needed to come back in 2 – 3 hours to get their room) and so ridiculous that Cherrlynn told me that when I came back for the room key in 2 hours, I had to wait in the check-in line all over again; she kept saying that this is the hotel policy and didn’t show any care about my complaint. So I had to spend 2 hours fooling around the hotel and finally I got a Premier room on the 18th floor, but, NO city view and NO queen beds…………(nothing I requested could be fulfilled)When I got to the room, it is pretty basic and not as nice as it shown on the website, it has a boring view overlook a development site and a loading dock. There was a small balcony in the room but the noise from the freeway below made you closed all the doors immediately. The flowerbed outside the balcony had all kind of trash there, like water bottle, tissue paper, paper bags…… The breakfast area was crowded and you had to wait in a long line to be seated. It seemed like a lot of variety but actually the taste was not that good and the hot items were either cold or just a bit warm. My colleagues from Singapore was right that Sands didn’t know how to run a hotel and they didn’t even care; they just wanna run a casino to make money ! I would never stay at this hotel again.",99
MBS,3,“maybe...if you like it big”,"The hotel is certainly interesting, rooms are nice of a normal 5* standard; service request were carried out quickly, luggage delivery and pick up was rather quick.However you need to stand in line for check-in and check-out which I just cannot consider 5*. In general the hotel is just too big to have anything personal about it and although the facilities are certainly 5* I would not return. The view from the top is great, the pool however is mostly so crowded that you don't feel like using it, more of a general attraction than a 5* hotel facility.",146
MBS,2,“Very poor service”,"While the rooms in the hotel are nice, the service is extremely poor and the prices are through the roof. The absolute minimum to be paid for breakfast is $75USD. There are several restaurants but they are all massive buffets and they are at least $75USD. There is NOWHERE to order an a la carte bowl of cereal or eggs and toast. Secondly, in the three nights I have stayed here at the hotel so far, neither my room nor my traveling companion's room have been cleaned until we spoke with management to directly request cleaning. The hotel is a MASSIVE resort with people wandering through the property at all hours. Again, the rooms are nice but the service and the pricing are ridiculous. I should say that I am by NO means cheap and I travel worldwide frequently. But $75USD for breakfast is absolutely ridiculous.",190
MBS,3,“Huge hotel”,"The hotel is huge and it was Dec thus school holidays in Malaysia and Singapore. Checking in took at least 30mins and we were not told we could check in at the VIP Lounge as we booked the Club floors. The main problem is there are so many rooms and not matching check in staff/counter and some people take longer to check in than normal.Other than that, the room is great,the housekeeping was excellent,no issue with extra towel. They has security check to go to the skypark on 57th floor which was ok with us and it is good that only room guest can go up.But the skypark was full but the view and the pool are great. The club on 57th was a very nice place, with nice food for breakfast,tea and cocktails. staff was friendly and took care of us. Only complaint is the club is small as we had to wait in line,in the rain as there were many guest. Maybe everyone turned up cos of the rain cos they couldn't go to the pool. Overall a good stay. Views from room and the skypark is great",104
MBS,2,“Disappointment.”,"1. Booked online for a Premier Room but was offered a Deluxe Room instead.2. Service personnel at the reception counter lacked professionalism, efficiency and warmth.3. Room was undoubtedly spacious but lacked the cosy factor.4. The droning of the vehicles on the highway just next to the hotel was highly disturbing. Room was not well insulated.5. Faced difficulties adjusting the temperature in the room. In fact, nothing could be done to the temperature despite the presence of the control system.6. Limited choice of channels on TV.7. Fridge space was non existent.8. Check out time at 11am was ridiculous.9. The bed was the only saving grace.",184
MBS,3,“Its a tourist spot more than a hotel”,"My family and I travel a lot, and its been quite a shock, such a contrast, transfering from conrads singapore, to marina bay sands. After the 5 star service we experienced from conrads, family and friends recommend we try marina bay sands for experience. It was really quite an experience! I guess, the crowd was no different from the well known hotels in las vegas, but the crowd is everywhere here, from restaurants, corridors, swimming pool,etc. And the ambiance did not encourage some considerations from guests, complete disregard of the privacy of guests. Everyone was doing their own thing. Talking out loud, shouting,etc. Hotel was too big, only place you dont encounter people is in your hotel room. Since we were given a room on the second floor, we could hear the cars, the noise of the people,they did not even consider using sound proof glass windows for the lower floorsIts a tourist spot, and you can have access if you have checked in. Its a good thing, we only stayed for a night. And the rates, were tooooo pricey, for such an experience.",104
MBS,2,“Over Price Hotel......”,"We stayed in the hotel on 17th December 2011 and 18th December 2011. The reason we stayed @ the hotel is because for the convenience for us to see the Wicked at the theatre. The only good about the hotel is near to the theatre and have the airport free shuttle. Basically, the room is design is simple and not luxury at all. No breakfast included. And the Infinity Pool is crowded. We went out for brunch until 11:30 am and our access card doesn't work because their check out time is strictly 11:00 am. We really feel the hotel is really over price.",192
MBS,3,"“Great pool, pity about the crowds”","The infinity pool (which we visited at sunrise at 7am) and the view from the Skypark (which we visited around 3pm) were amazing. The dinner buffet at Rise restaurant was great - wonderful seafood and yummy desserts - we'd definitely recommend it.The queue at checkout was also amazing - for its length. (We checked in at 9:30pm and were offered a room on Level 2, or alternatively the option to wait for an hour for a room above the 30th floor, which we accepted - our room (on Level 39) was nice and well proportioned - as expected.I should add that that you can go to the buffet and the skypark WITHOUT being a hotel guest, however to access the pool you DO have to be a guest.I'm happy we did it once, but we will only do it once. If you make sure you don't checkin or checkout when everyone else is trying to do the same, your stay will be much better. That being said - I don't know how they could make this process any better - there are heaps of rooms, and lots of people coming and leaving.",81

Instead of providing upgraded room for the long delay, I was ask to stay in tower 1 instead of tower 2 which are more convenience to access to The Club restaurant from tower 2.Hotel Front Desk service take too long to process the check in. Swiming in the pools is like exbition with visiter walking around looking.",140
MBS,1,“why did i bother?”,"possibly the most disappointing hotel stay ever. the first issue was the impersonal feeling you get at the hotel, it is supposed to be 5 stars but there is nobody to help you with your luggage or take it to your room (or at least there wasn't for me), there is no turn down service in the evening either. the rooms are of quite a good size but the furniture looks cheap, the toiletries wouldn't be out of place in a hostel...the swimming pool was by far the biggest disappointment, the water was extremely dirty and while the view is amazing it is just not worth it. we had lunch at the ku de ta bar and it also felt very dirty.the best bit was our trip to the Banyan Tree spa which was totally empty and had amazing facilities",694
MBS,2,“Nice..... sleep only.”,"We arrived at MBS 2.30pm, amazed by the crowd at ALL the reception area, people checking in, people checking out, and people waiting for transport to everywhere.Following the queue, well mannered service staff ask if we are checking in or out, about our room category, and told us to prepare our passport, reservation letter and relevant documents. He then led us to a shorter queue. Other staff came by and offered us some bottled mineral while we are waiting. about 20mins or so, we reach the counter staff.As she checked our reservation, she told us that only room for level 2 is ready. i made a reservation for grand horizon room, and you assigned to me a level 2 room? i believe you are famous for the \view\"" and \""service\"".... and that is what i paid for? She told us, if we want a higher floor rooms, she can make arrangements and room will be ready by 4pm, and she will call to us. 4.30pm and nobody calls, we rejoin the LONG queue again. she apologize for the inconvenience and for that, she will compensate us with late checkout. now i understand, the roll over effect all the guest had resulted in such a mess in the lobby and reception.finally i got my room key, but it led me a to WRONG tower. instead of Tower 2, receptionist had asked me to go to Tower 1. I approached a chinese house keeping lady, which has no idea where my room was. after some hassle. we found out room, and worst to come.we entered our room, and we had a feeling that \""somebody\"" is still inside. the room is not kept properly, with the room card still inserted, rubbish, half drank bottled water. I made a complaint to the \""express service line\"" but nobody appeared in 20mins. i called them again and i told them, i will leave the room now and we expect someone to housekeep it when we return.This place is over crowded anyway. if you had heard about the infinite pool, so many people is there already. they had some crowd control measures, which i feel they had done a good job already. you should experience the beautiful view from the pool and enjoy the afternoon or evening there. Ku De Ta, must go! and you don't have to pay cover charge if you enter early.Finally, we are satisfied about the room condition. I must say the room is well equipped with all necessities and all the equipments are in good condition. the curtains are power controlled, big TV, comfortable sofa and bed. and very spacious in the Grand room. We had a good undisturbed good night rest and morning service as our request. view from my \""city-skyline view\"" at 22nd floor is not great at all. i did paid for extra to get a good view, but its not what i expected. Buffet breakfast was included in our stay package and RISE is huge and overcrowded. they have a wide spread of international buffet breakfast and good quality food. Generous with their servings, so please ask for smaller portion if they serve it to you. seats turn around pretty fast so you dont have wait long to get a place for your breakfast.We did express checkout at 2pm (by dropping the keys and filled in some forms) because of the long queue at the reception. i hope they don't make a mess out of my credit card bill later. i worry because they charged a higher sum on my credit card during my check in.Generally, service staff is very polite and patient (despite the continuous non stop crowd they have to handle) but i must say they can be more efficient, or they need to employ more to handle the huge crowd. Its only the waiting time that is really bad and MUST be improved immediately.sorry, but i have to say this is not what i paid for. i will not recommend anyone to here for business trip or vacation stay. There is much better hotels around, and they can walk from them to MBS for the casinos or shopping areas.""",315
MBS,1,“Nice hotel but poor service”,"Staying at Sands because of the musical Wicked.But I am not going to stay here again.We checked in at 3pm, and asked the staff to get a room on higher level, he guaranteed to gave us one when we come back later. We got our room at 49/F at 5PM ( there's another lady helping us to check in when we came back, but she's only willing to give us a room on 4/F at first, not until we told her another staff which is next to her GUARANTEED to give us if we wait)As we have 3 people we paid for one extra bed, we did remind the lady to prepare extra bed for us. Since we were watching WICKED that night we assumed that the extra bed and the room should be ready when we back, but when we came back at 12am, there was no extra bed in the room. (nor the towel, cups, toothbrush and etc, stuff are just for 2 people...)We have to wait 30 minutes for the bed to come, and when we can go to bed it's already 1am. So we requested to have late checkout, the staff offered 1pm check out, but the extra bed is late for 7 hours finally she offered late checkout at 3pm, but during the conversation knowing our situation she didn't apologize at all.The service is terrible, the lady who helped us to check in is unfriendly, I don't mind if there is no smile on her face but I don't see she was even trying to help us to get a higher level room unless we told her another staff had made promise to us. The room itself is not bad, the pool on skypass is nice, but with poor management and staff I don't think I will stay here anymore. Especially when I stayed in Mandarin Oriental the night before.",201
MBS,3,“5 star hotel with poor of services”,"It took me a while to write review about my trip to Marina Bay Sand Hotel Singapore. I decided to book Marina Bay Sand due to some good reviews on the internet. I expected excellent services from this hotel since the hotel called itself as a 5 star hotel and the room rate is high.However, I found that the hotel is too big. Hotel staff can't provide their services to all hotel.guests. During my stay, I had no chance to see any hotel staff apart from I did check in. Hotel breakfast was pricey with varieties of food. However, the taste of hotel breakfast was so so. Moreover, I had to queue to have a breakfast since the hotel had plenty of guests and didn't manage restaurant well enough.The hotel location is too far. I only have to take a taxi to town. Moreover, I can't find any super market near by hotel at all.The only thing that I like about this hotel is the room, which is big and comfortable. However, during my stay, the music outside the room was too loud and it really bothered my husband and I.I don't think I will go back to this hotel again.",178

When checked in at 3 pm (check in was extremely busy), room was not available, and ask to come back after 1 1/2 hr. Room was then available only from 6pm....terrible start.Main hotel lobby is again too busy, more like a train station than a 5 star hotel. Overall service received was very poor compare to most 4 or 5 star hotel in Singapore...Pool view is definetely astonishing, even if most of the areas are reserved for dining in people or who stay on executives floors...Overall stay very poor with average service.",260
MBS,2,"“Bad Service, lost staffs”","I was here with some family members for a staycation and also a birthday celebration for my brother.Check-in was 3pm but we reached 320pm. By right room was supposed to be ready, but when we wanted to check-in we were told to wait for another hour for room to be available. Alot of excuses were given as to why room wasn't available. We were irritated and agitated but we negotiated to be checked in as soon as possible. They finally managed to get us a room, an upgrade to club room. By then it was almost 345pm. It was a sea-view room. We took it coz we were already out of schedule. The view kinda sucked coz we initially requested for city view room, and sea-view was facing the sea and some construction was going on. When we opened the door of the balcony, it can't be helped that we managed to breathe in dust. It was such a turn-off. Anyway other than reception and room view, room was OK...When we were checking out, I overheard some guests received complimentary check-in. It was only 12noon. I wonder if they even book first? Or maybe we are just locals so it's not a fair treatment?An advise to locals, please do not drive here, they don't have complimentary parking although we are guests. Comparing this hotel to others similarly in Singapore, I can assure other hotels have way better service than this hotel do. And u should only ask the valet counter about parking charges, reception have totally no clue about it.",217
MBS,2,“Don't be cheated by its aesthetics!!”,"1) it's such a terrible experience on entering an airport like lobby, crowds of people waiting for check-in with luggages all over. dont expect they have bell boys to take care of your luggage.2) My room is on the lower floors which is small and so noisy at night, the glass panels are also so dusty.3) They have missed my request of a baby cot which took me 2 hours to fetch for one. i am so pissed off by their management, perhaps they are still incapable of dealing with such great numbers of guests. However, hotel staff are friendly under such stressful conditions.4) Dont expect you will have 5-star toiletries, they are just as minimal as for a 3 star hotel.5) The infinity pool is just like an animal farm full of people wearing their normal outfits with shoes stepping into the pool to take photos! Kids are not allowed in the pool, they can only stay in the shallow portion where most people step into with their shoesAfterall, the hotel has nothign wrong if you only need to pay for US$100/night. It's never kids friendly too. I would definitely not come again! sorry to say that my previous stay in Fullerton which is less costly is much much more unforgettable, it's super value for money!",158
MBS,1,“5-star facilities with 1-star service”,"Booked 2 premier rooms for 3 nights each.

When we collected the keys at 4pm, they said one of the rooms wasn't available yet because the guest hasn't checked out yet. They asked us to wait until 8pm. When we came back from dinner at 9pm, the room was still not ready and were asked to wait for another hour. We at last got the key of the room that we booked after 31 HOURS!!!!! This is really unacceptable. It may be recorded in the Guiness book of records as the longest waiting hour for a hotel room after you check in.",268
MBS,3,“Getting better and yet worse in various areas.”,"Spacious rooms and bathrooms, lovely decor, comfortable beds, huge TV, great views.....I've stayed here many times and there have been many improvements since it opened till now. The service has improved by leaps so do take this into consideration when reading older reviews. They have acted on several feedback from guests which is great. What is better now. Free wi-fi to start... About time! Non-room guests are no longer allowed in the pool area so there is more privacy. The room service menu as well as pool menu is improved, but the standard of food served is inconsistent. Dishes I have enjoyed in the past disappointed when I ordered them again. This has put me off in-room dining. They have removed the minimum order surcharge for room service. Smart move. Showers have been installed at the pool. The overall service level of the staff is much better. On my first few stays, there was a shortage of staff and those present were often lacking in crucial knowledge. There were also long waiting times and mistakes made which have since decreased. What used to impress which now no longer is the standard of cleanliness in the rooms. The rooms are obviously not as well cleaned. To name a few.... The bathroom floor at the sides and corners are always dirty. The carpets are dusty. You don't want to look under the beds. Ugh. Balconies are also filthy. I just found a lipstick stain on my mug yesterday. I would not normally include these in my reviews of fewer-starred properties but one of this standard and price, I expect more.",284

(sunny weather, but the water in the pool was quiet cold)BUT...BUT...BUT: Check-in at 5pm took us 20 minutes queue, got to the room (#723) and surprisingly: it was NOT CLEAN! Although well stated on the booking we requested for a non-smoking room, upon opening the door we were blown away from the smell of cigarettes and above all: There was still an ashtray in the room with some 10 or so cigarettebutts. How can a housekeeping miss out on that? SHAME on YOU Marina Bay Sands! We didn't even bother to check the rest of the room: it was below expectations: NOT CLEAN! Back to reception...and the queue... Got another room...(#5016) we had trouble with the keycard. (which you need also for the elevator)...so back to the reception and...the queue...3 times... Remember that the roomfloors are with carpets, which in our case were quiet stained...and if you are allergic, like in my case, make sure to have some antihistamine on hand. Otherwise the room is nice, bathroom is spacious and has all necessary amenities. Forget about putting something in the minibar, the minibar is fully stocked, no open space left and remember: You touch, you pay! We stayed only one night. The ice skating rink was closed due to a special exposition, the Science museum with Titanic expo was also closed 'for a private function' (13 Dec). Due to all the trouble, queue-dirty room-key problem-closed attractions, what was to be our highlight of Singapore was a disappointment. And besides all the trouble, I still would recommend you to stay once in your life at this hotel. Overpriced, but there is a 'WOW' awaiting you...",32

MBS,2,“Don't waste your money”,"We recently spent three nights in a Club Room at the Marina Bay Sands and were so disappointed. The standard of service was poor. The non-smoking rooms smelt so bad that we had to ask to be moved (twice). Other hotels seem to get this right, why not MBS? The third room was an improvement, but still didn't smell good. Our bathroom in the third room was dirty - there was yellowish-brown slime under the seat in the shower recess and the corners in that area hadn't been adequately cleaned. We couldn't adjust the air-con.Other negatives? The staff were, on the whole, amateurish. There were no chairs in the foyer, other than in restaurants or bars.Positive points? The views from the roof and the gym were stunning, though to enjoy these we could have stayed in a less expensive room.",380
MBS,1,“Awesome hotel -until check in”,"When my wife got to Marina Bay Sands, we were blown away by the architecture of the hotel, then we got to check in. We were booked in for 3 nights which was clearly written on our ticket but the girl at reception told us we were only booked in for 2 nights. We showed her the tickets but she said the reservations department had only booked us for 2 nights. She told us that we had to call our travel agent in Australia to sort it out but we told her that we had already paid for 3 nights and that it was up to MBS to sort it out. As we were on our honeymoon, we were hoping to at least get a room on quite a high level but we didn't even get halfway up the building. We stayed on the 17th floor & the view was ok but nothing special. The rooms are nothing to rave home about, very standard hotel room. We also waited for our bags for over an hour and it wasn't until I called to find out where they were that they eventually arrived.The pool is quite spectacular but unfortunately, we were already looking forward to leaving. We had ordered room service for breakfast as we were going on tours that day, but even though it turned up on time, it was quite cold. Maybe MBS could look at not putting hot food on cold plates then onto a cold steel box?When we went to check out, we thought about doing the express check out but thought better check the bill & i'm glad we did. They tried to charge us for the extra night that we had already paid for months ago but took it off when I showed the receptionist our tickets. That was the final straw in 3 nights of incompetency from Marina Bay Sands.To finish with, we would never stay there again. It's great to go look at as it is a spectacular building but as long as you don't have to put up with the terrible service, it's fine. It has a long way to go to compete with the best hotels in the world even though it is one of the best looking buildings ever built.",211
MBS,3,“A 4* masquerading as a 5*”,"This hotel is undeniably impressive from an architectural perspective - the building is spectacular. However, it is a HUGE hotel and this means that it is not really possible for the staff to provide the level of service you would expect from a 5*. Three other things pointed up the fact it was not really a 5*: (i) we were initially allocated a room on the outside of the hotel. It was on the 3rd floor directly above an 8 carriageway road - traffic noise was audible throughout the night. If you do book, make sure you stay on a higher floor - we asked to be transferred and were given a room which was higher and quieter - apparently, the hotel depends on the \high rollers\"" who stay at the casino and they get the pick of the best rooms (ii) our room had not been cleaned properly - human hair (and a lot of it) was on the carpet and the carpet also had stain; (iii) the breakfast area is massive and has so many people it is basically like eating at a work canteen - not at all a special experience. If you do stay, make sure to visit the roof top pool - it is truly spectacular!""",250
MBS,3,"“Nice building, awful service”","We stayed here 2 nights in one of the rooms on the higher levels, actually the 50th floor. the view was amazing, the rest was poor. check in was standard, we checked in at lobby 1, our room was at lobby 3. I was 8 months pregnant, nobody offered me a drive in the golfcart. Halfway I stopped the golfcart myself. Room was spacious and pleasant. However not enough towels in the bathroom, there was a rainshower in the bathroom, however pressure was very poor, so not a pleasant shower and very slippery. Pool on top of the roof very cold.Service very slow at the pool. Next morning at breakfast there was a queue of at least 30 people. Which is not acceptable for the price you pay. The biggest disaster arrived when we ordered later that day roomservice; the bread of my caesarsalad was rotten, it was full of green stuff, which the roomservice manager tried to sell as herbs. however after tasting he agreed it was rotten. We ordered a babysitter, which cost us 160 dollar for 4 hours. Just nice to know that you pay in singapore for a fulltime helper in house 500 sgd per month ! After this stay I sent a letter of complaint, however I nver heard anything. Keeping in mind that I could have been in serious condition after eating the rotten food and being pregnant 8 months....I would recommend the hotel for the view, but that's it.

Don't expect personal attention, because you are one of 10000 guests per day. The F&B service is good, food it average. The facilities are ok (free wi-fi), but the rooms are really nothing special, except for the view, which is ok.... but e.g. any hotel would open the bathroom and place a window so that you can sit in the bathtub and look out the harbor. Here there is a wall that makes the bathroom dark and closed.",322
MBS,3,“Let Down by Its Service”,"I've watched this complex build up over the past few years. It is very impressive and in fact, for a hotel, I feelit is too large and far too busy in the main lobby. There are as many sight-seers as guests and large crowds all of the time. In the Tower 1 lifts, you could be waiting for a while because of the large numbers of people wanting to go up to the roof area - there should be a separate lift to the top. The rooms are very good and I had an excellent view of Singapore from the 37th floor. The infinity pool is quite amazing. However, while some staff provide good service, others don't and this might be due to the newness of the hotel. The check in girl at Tower 1 that I had at first was stressed for whatever reason and couldn't find my reservation after several variations on my name - she didn't even offer me a room after I said I would go over to the Ritz Carlton instead. I then went down to Tower 3 check in where the girl did find my reservation eventually. The service at breakfast is where the problems are - tables not cleared, coffee not replenished, etc and that was consistant over 5 days. The main thing they wanted to do was to give you the $44 bill for the delights of the breakfast. There are quite big queues at times both at check-in and check-out. As you would expect the prices in the hotel reflect the 5* status so do beware of the bill for your late night drink in the bar where, by the way, the service is very good. Overall, after the novelty factor, I would not stay here again because of its more distant location from the main sights/CBD of Singapore. I will stick to the other hotels on the other side of the marina.",138
MBS,2,“Falls short of top hotel standards”,It's iconic and stands out as an architectural structure. But it doesn't operate like a high end hotel at all. Booked a room in advance and gave them my room requests in writing. Guess what? They didn't bother at all and I had a shock during my check-in. Your booking is just another number to them and it's a take it or leave it attitude. What's the point of accepting a reservation when they gloss over your needs? It totally ruined the celebration plans I had for an anniversary celebration with my wife. Made a check with a local contact and ended up in a hotel a stone's throw away near Suntec City and immediately felt a world of experience in customer service like what a good hotel should provide. Lesson learnt in going to such over-rated hotels.,29

MBS,3,“Not for Business Traveller”,"Yes - awesome view on the 57th floor - looks superb. However, it's pretty average not like the building as it stand tall. Check this out - International buffee in the morning, you will be asked to seat & ask what would you like to drink - let's say coffee, they will serve tea.I couldn't check-in to my flight as the internet is extreamly horrible. I complained but no one take a notice. I found out in absense of internet, that when the capcity is not enought for the demand. So if there are more people - dont stay here in you are in business.",282
MBS,3,“Better than expected”,"Had been told by many that the Marina Bay Sands has a lot of issues and that I should avoid it. However, I found that my stay to be generally good and in fact better than expected. Maybe my expectations had been so depressed by the unanimously negative comments, but I found the rooms to be good sized and well appointed. Double glazed glass meant that you couldn't hear the major highway that is on the hotel's doorstep and you couldn't even see it from the room unless you step out onto the balcony. The rooms are well utilized and there were some signs of wear and tear on the furniture, but nothing extreme. I would say that the room compares favorably with both the Ritz Carlton and the Hyatt Hotel with not much to choose between them. The high traffic at the hotel/casino complex means that there is a good flow of taxis, although there was still a bit of a wait at peak times and when it rained. However, I felt that it was marginally better than when I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and the Hyatt.Location wise, the Marina Bay Sands is great if you are gambling or if you are attending a function at the convention center. It is also relatively close (and walking distance through the casino and mall) to the Marina Bay Financial Center complex.Service was a bit mixed as there was a long line to check in and the size of the complex means that its about as far from a personalized boutique hotel as you can get. But if that's not what you are looking for, then it's a decent option in Singapore.",481
MBS,3,“Skypark and infinity pool saved our day on Marina Bay Sands”,"Last year I visited Singapore and I saw the Marina Bay Hotel ending its construction. So I said to myself…next time I must overnight here!So, in August 2011, on my return from Lombok, I overnight in Marina Bay Sands, with my family. My expectations were too high, but it turned out not as good as I was expected. And it started on check-in…what a mess! Not proper of a 5 star hotel! First, the hotel was overbooking, we checked in at 8 pm and there were no room available for us and for our friends. We had reservations confirmed by a travel agency voucher, so they had to give us a room. And we had a small and simple room, not worthy a 390 € room we paid. My friends had a memorable experience, once in a life, and we shared it with them – a night in Presidential Suite. UAUH! But on my normal experience, after a hard check in, we were totally getting alone to go to our Tower room. No one lead us to the room. The hotel was so big and we had to ask everyone where is the Tower 3 and how to get on the lift. Finally, we get by ourselves with 2 kids to the room.Of course, on the morning, we didn’t know where to have breakfast, so needed to search it again. Breakfast was so crowded, with lot of people, lot of noise and too messy for us. There was plenty of food and for all kinds of tasty, but it was not a relaxing and enjoying meal.The skypark, the infinity pool and the Ku De Ta restaurant bar saved our day in Marina Bay Sands. When we went upstairs, we where completely amazed with that view, that we forgot the others experiences. We spend the morning on that fabulous pool, enjoying ourselves, and the lunch a snack on the KU DE TA.The rest of the day was wonderful!At night we had a truly trouble to get on our transfer. The hotel doesn’t have a proper lobby. It doesn’t have a place for people wait for their pickup. It’s a chaos! My kids where tired and they didn’t had a chair to seat, they had to seat on the floor while waiting for transfer. And most of the people must wait standing on the lobby. There was no information about the busses arrivals area, and we were waiting for a long time for our bus, getting stressed because it didn’t shown up and then It was waiting for us on their underground area. So, too crowed and tourist hotel. No information and no personal attention to its guests.It was a wonderful experience to stay on the top of the building swimming, but I’m sorry to say, but I’m not convinced to visit it again when I will pass through Singapore some other day.",112
MBS,3,“Won't be my first choice in future”,"Hotel room is quite normal. Has a huge balcony which I find is a wasted space personally. Pool is definitely beautiful and worth a visit even if you are not hotel guest. Lots of people try to get to pool floor for the bar in the evening, which i find makes it very inconvenient for hotel guest. Room service and reception staff are very helpful and friendly.Security staff at both hotel and casino has attitude problems!!! Came across 3 of them during my stay and they are the worse security I have ever come across! Should send them to Macau for training!!!! Wrote a long letter to Marina Bay Sand about it.",164
MBS,3,"“Fantastic view, average service”","The good:The view is fantastic (we were on 47th floor facing the city). Room is well equipped. Hotel staff are generally friendly. The pool view is fantastic.The bad:Check in was uncomfortable. I had a lady standing very close to me (and she's obviously not part of my group) while checking in and hotel staff made no effort to check what she wants or to advise her to stand behind in the queue if she's checking in. When I informed the hotel staff that I'm uncomfortable having someone standing so close, she just smiled at me.There was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in my room although it was supposed to be on a non-smoking floor.The pool attracted a huge crowd. Definitely not ideal if you want to have a decent swim.The pillows are too soft and not well-laundered. There was smell of sweat on the cushions.The walk from the carpark to the hotel lobby takes me 10 minutes. Now imagine doing that with luggage.",362
MBS,3,“Mass processing factory”,"MBS is the new icon of Singapore, and as a tourist attraction it is worth visiting at least once. Make no mistake: it is not a business hotel. The \integrated resort\"" functions in two ways: first, thanks to its vast offering of shops, entertainment and dining, plus its flashy architecture, it attracts large numbers of visitors; second, its 2,500 rooms can process a commensurate number of guests; the ultimate objective is to channel the masses into the casino floor, where MBS draws the bulk of its considerable revenue; the rooms can be priced very reasonably. The level of service derives from this business model. If you are a gambling VIP, I have no doubt that it must be excellent. If not, you will be competently handled, together with a few thousand others, but should not expect personal attention because the staff has no time and is not trained for it. Check-in and check-out, in particular, entail waiting in long lines. The standard rooms are modern, average in size, not particularly luxurious. The quality of the materials appears average, not sure how they will age. Bathrooms are OK, not over the top. Room service is slow and not very responsive. The views are spectacular if facing North (city skyline), boring if facing South (construction works). The most famous part of the hotel is the skypark, with its star attractions the infinity pool and the lounge/restaurant/bar Ku De Ta. The pool, reserved for hotel guests, is impressive, but one has to be prepared to swim under the gaze of the endless crowd of visitors. Ku De Ta is ostentatiously hip, but again too crowded and touristy to be really cool. Location is so-so. With so much entertainment on-site, one can easily stay in the resort and not need to go out - after all, that is the whole concept. No other attraction or point of interest is within walking distance, although that may change in the future, as the new Marina Bay CBD develops. Bottom line: a possible family destination for a couple of days, like a theme park; a no-brainer for gamblers; not a good hotel if one has other business in town.""",98
MBS,3,“A bit of a damp squib”,"When you are going to a what is a landmark hotel, I guess its okay to have high expectations. While the rooms were spacious , nice and had a lovely view of the harbour, there's a construction going on one of the sides and the balcony opens out to this view . The hotel feels very cold and antiseptic, none of the warm hospitality of the Fullerton . The only saving grace - Ku De Ta on the 57th floor and one of the best views of SG by night (and of the F1 track during the race).",66
MBS,1,“Bad Service”,"This hotel has the worst service. I got F&B credit at check in because the rooms were not ready until 5pm. But My F&B credit wasn't honored when I checked out. I email them about this. The response of the first 2 emails were that the would get back to me. But after 6 emails and a month letter, they still hadn't reply to my inquiry.",99
MBS,3,“A few flaws detracted from otherwise fine stay.”,"Hotel is large but very efficient. Room size was good and bathroom was nice but many stains on carpeting (Rm 4821 tower 3) detracted from cleanliness and appearance of room. Disappointing for only 1 year old and otherwise quality hotel.Ku de Ta was very nice but dinner at Jin Shan was horrible. Service was terrible. A table of 4 waited nearly 45 min for food to arrive after ordering and watched several other tables arrive, eat, and leave. Servers seemed to be avoiding us as we had to find them to ask about order. Food was average at best.",80
MBS,3,"“Great pool and view, now entirely worth it.”","Novel is the best way to describe MBS. I have stayed, swam in the pool, now I will stay somewhere else. I have stayed here several times and every time I leave, I feel like its not fully worth it. I find the restaurants lacking and some of the most expensive for what they offer. The rooms, while fine is size and offering, are nothing overly special. So I am left wondering why they are the most expensive in town.",303
MBS,1,“Poor Service”,"Stayed there for two nights on a business trip. Service there was horrendous.1) I was in the lift and asked a hotel staff if I was in the right tower, he told me he doesnt work in the hotel department and asked me to ask someone else.2) Next, I tried to get some laundry done. Someone came to my room to pick it up. I asked her how to pay for it and she completely didn't understand what I was saying. Eventually she just shaked her head and left.3) The WORST experience I had was with the concierge. It was a Sunday night and it was pouring outside. The queue for the taxi stand was too long and I was running late for a meeting. I asked the concierge if he could book me a taxi urgently. He tried for about 2 minutes and then he got back to me saying he couldnt get through to the taxi company and suggested I wait in line. The gentleman was wearing Les Clef d'Or (the Golden Keys) on his jacket lapels. It is my understanding that this is the pinnacle of service standards. Those who wear the golden keys are generally able to achieve the impossible, but yet he was unable to book me a taxi! I was utterly disappointed. The concierge definitely does not deserve to wear the golden keys, it is an absolute disgrace! In the end I had to run out to the main street in the rain wearing a suit and carrying my luggage. By the time I reached my destination, I was drenched and sweating profusely and very late.I strongly recommend the Ritz Carlton to anyone looking for better service. They never say no, and ALL their staff are extremely well trained.Definitely not staying at the Marina Bay Sands again!",212
MBS,3,“Size does matter”,"Impressive to look at, rooms were really nice, food and beverage outlets good but just too big to have any level of personality and the typical over the top security with a rule book that is inflexible and plain unhelpful. By way of example, we arrived at 10am, expecting our room would not be ready till 2pm but fully expecting to be able to use the rooftop pool and liesure area while we waited...but NO. Because we did not have a room key, we could not access the roof top?? Despite the fact we were, in essence, paying for 48 hours we really only got 36 hours of \product\"" and the lack of any understanding of this, all the way to head of security was plain dumb. Surely a \""day pass\"" or some system of allowing guests access while waiting for their room to be ready would be an easy fix. Just one example of a heap of \""silly little things\"" which took the edge off the experience, particularly as we had transferred from another much better hotel to this one. Do yourself a favour, for about the same money, stay at Mandarin Oriental. The best hotel I have ever stayed in.....and it has a fantastic view of Marina Bay Sands hotel""",100
MBS,1,“Nice...but service is horrible!!!”,"The level of service in this hotel is unacceptable! There are not enough people, they are badly trained and the level of confusion is immense. It is not worth the price paid!! Today I was told that my room would be changed (as requested)...and that I could go for dinner and get the keys later...what happened was that I got back...stayed in the queue for ages (as there was just one lady in the check in desk) only to be told that...they have given my room to someone else..!It is VERY disappointing!! Come here to visit...but stay in another hotel!!",125
MBS,3,“Wouldn't Stay There Again”,Have just stayed 2 nights & whilst the place is amazing I would not stay there again. Basically its just way too big and very impersonal. From the moment we arrived to check in I was regretting it as there was people everywhere. The room itself was lovely but we found the Skypark so overcrowded it was hard to even find a chair to sit on. Breakfast was very average and considering we payed more to stay there then our previous hotel which was much better we were really disappointed. My advice would be to stay elsewhere and buy a day pass for the Skypark or just take the lift up and have a drink at the Skypark restaurant so you get to see it.,60
MBS,3,“A mixed bag”,"I have stayed at MBS a few times, for business and pleasure. There are some great things - the pool on top is outstanding, the Rise lounge has great food. There are some poor things; room service slow and the internet is incredibly temperamental. There are better hotels in Singapore to stay in (although stay once, for the pool :))",143
MBS,3,“Yet to keep up with the influx of travellers”,"Stayed there for 1 night in Grand Room with city views as a birthday treat. The room itself was huge (79 square meters according to the official website), really felt like a suite. The ceiling-to-floor french windows lent an amazing view to beauty of Singapore, day and night. Even the bathroom offered some views to the construction land behind the hotel (interesting to see while sitting in the bath). There is nothing to complain about this well appointed room but the service was poor. The hotel seemed overwhelmed by the number of guests and severely understaffed. Check-in queue was already a 20-min waiting time. Room service was almost non-existent. Any calls to the housekeeping were answered and serviced after an hour. The rooftop infinity pool is overrated - just too small! just too crowded! I was glad it was only for one night.",53
MBS,3,“the marina bay sands”,"this is one of the good hotels of the Singapore with great exterior, but not that good interior. the hotel has 2500 rooms and just around 800 staff which results into not so good serivice. the room are not that good according to the tariff, but the ultimate experience is the sky deck.",214
MBS,3,“Be aware of room options”,"The hotel is a nice huge hotel with casino in the basement, a huge infinity pool on 57th floor overlooking the city, is connected with a huge mall, and has a number of restaurants (from celebrity chefs to 24hr. food court). The pool atmosphere is family oriented, and the overall atmosphere is a mix of business folks and tourist, mostly staying a few days in Singapore while off to somewhere else. This is an international hotel with not discernible cultural influence.The one thing that disappointed me was the room situation. They originally gave me a \grand\"" room. It was an open suite that was very large, and had nice little touches, like an instant coffee machine with pods, and a full set of toiletries in the bathroom, etc. The downside was that it overlooked the highway and the noise kept me awake. I asked to move to a higher room, but they insisted on downgrading me to a \""deluxe\"" room. I asked many times to keep the \""grand\"" but was denied. The second room was much smaller, as expected, and lacked the coffee machine, the full set of toiletries, and had a noisy air conditioner. I guess you need to choose between a nice noisy room, or a less nice room without highway noise.""",273
MBS,3,“amazing view less personal service”,"We stayed in Marina bay sands hotel last june 2011 together with my colleagues, a very huge and overwhelming hotel, spectacular architecture and designs. rooms with automatic curtains, adequately lighted room,flat tv, though the bathroom shower door has no designed lock, and since im staying with colleagues we made rules on how to determine if someone is using the bathroom. very noticeable, since its a very huge hotel with high occupancy rates, the service is less personal. we decided to took a dip in their infinity pool were called in room service for bathrobes and we waited for ages, so my friend and I decided to just go ahead with swimsuits and shorts and we went ahead. no concierge to take your luggages, so you need to bring your luggages yourself, with a big hotel, the elevator are so small, and the corridor where the elevator are situated are very narrow. though the elevator are high speed such that no line piling up on the elevator. With crowded place i must admit, lobby area no available sofas for sitting. we were not allowed to check in earlier, though we left our luggages in the hotel concierge, to kill time we spent walking aimlessly in the shopping mall area with our laptop and valuables waiting for our check in time which was already 6pm. we haven't rested yet, since we were touring with a group, and we have schedules to follow. i was not able to rest before our next schedule which I should have been done upon arrival but since allowed check in time was late, i was rushing for the scheduled activity.",13
MBS,2,“Bad View”,"Construction view outside the window, noisy ,dirty and not many activity for kids.",277
MBS,1,“save your money - go elsewhere”,"stayed here for 7 nights last week. checked in at 1am and was given a room on the 4th floor. upon opening the door to enter the room the noise from the freeway hits you immediately, the beige patterned carpet was filthy, as if food had been dropped all over the room - the two chairs were the same with food and drink stains all over - plus there was mould growing in the shower !! rang the service desk to req room change - advised somebody will call me back. nobody did. rang again - and again explained the whole situation and promised a call back - again nobody called back. went to front desk and req change of room, hotel full so no other rooms available. next morning rang services again - who moved me to a room on the 34th floor. much quieter and cleaner - but just no wow factor with this hotel. it seems to be a property designed for the masses, crowds everywhere - from the packed pool area to the shopping centre style lobby - it really just doesn't deliver as a 5 star property. i had already been to singapore 3 times this year and had stayed at the 2 x fullerton properties plus the marriott - each superior to this hotel. unfortunately all 3 had no rooms available when i called to move from marina bay. take my advice people. the hotel is run down and dirty already, provides poor service and really isn't worth the $$s, i dread to think what condition it will be in another 12 months. go elsewhere - i know i will ....",119
MBS,3,“Marina bay sands- Singapore”,"a great location,a great architecture, spacious rooms hi-tech rooms,mesmerising viiews from the roof top(and all hotel rooms), variety of dinning options,a shopping complex in the complex, a casio to splurge upon, a stunning pool, a good conference center.. the list of activities you can do in this hotel is endless. on the flip side, the service is slow, lobby over crowded. wish there was a separate lobby for hotel guests and even the lifts as many times hotel guest too have to wait to go upstairs. the spa had not opened at the time i had checked in in june 2011. but then its a new hotel and am sure that the management would work about removing these problems.",284
MBS,1,“Lots of flaws need to be sorted out”,"Definitely not a hotel I would recommend. The check-in process was excruciatingly slow, and the reception counter was located in a crowded shopping mall with throngs of people shuffling by noisily.I checked in tonight and was told they only have a room on the second floor because the hotel is full, which is fine by me. But I did not expect the roar of highway noise when I opened the door to the room. Turns out the room is almost at eye level and 100 feet away from a busy highway, and the glass doors do not close tightly enough to create a seal from the noise. At my request the hotel sent a service rep, who attempted to lock the glass doors without success, and then told me this is a design flaw in the hotel and they are sealing the glass doors in all the rooms, working from the top floors down. This process evidently has not reached the second floor yet. There are lots of other minor flaws in the room, for example, flying insects in the room, and ants on the bedsheets; the wifi in the room is slow and hard to log on to; there's no bath in the bathroom, and so on. I've only checked in for four hours so I'm sure I'll encounter more flaws during my stay. This is definitely not a five-star establishment, I would put it at 3-stars at the most. I know it's a casino hotel, but it's also right next to a convention center and will host lots of business travelers, who usually care most about two things: good Internet connectivity, and a good night's sleep. Marina Bay Sands Hotel delivers neither.",307
MBS,3,“Expect so-so service at a hotel this big.”,"Hotel is huge with three towers. The location is in Marina Bay, but a bit away from any of the office buildings. It is connected to one of the 2 casinos in Singapore, as well as a shopping mall, food court, convention center, and theater, so the complex amenities are very abundant. Rooms are pretty nice, and new, but had some problems. I was upgraded to a higher floor junior suite type of room. However, the room was a bit too big, being very long in shape, making it not very comfy. There were 2 LCD TVs but only one of them worked. I complained once, but noone came to fix it. There was only warm and hot water in the shower... cold did not work, and the water pressure was so-so. I also had expected better name brand bathroom fixtures. Bed and pillows were very comfortable. Internet is available for an additional charge, but they do give you some free use of the internet connected PCs in the business center.The pool on the roof is huge and very nice, but \tourists\"" are able to access the roof garden and gawk into the pool area, although they are not allowed to enter the pool deck area itself. Although the pools are very nice, they don't have any sort of uber \""cool\"" Las Vegas vibe, although the try. The pool area feeling is more family like. Gym is quite nice with locker room including amenities such as whirlpool, etc.Restaurants were so-so, but the complex overall has very many choices, including many American restaurant branches, such as Mozza and Daniel Boulud, etc. There is also a local Singapore style food court, which is nice to have in air conditioned comfort, but the food quality in this food court are not actually up to the real local food taste standards.""",109
MBS,3,“Nice but way too big”,"just spent 5 nights here and arrived at 1am to check in and the place was still buzzing with music and people.Room in tower 2 was OK, next to the freeway and with a balcony door that wouldnt shut fully so was quite noisy. Bed nice but pillow very soft ....Breakfast in 'RISE' was a nice spread but too many people and navigating back to your table wasn't fun. The dinner buffet at the same spot was fantastic.The obvious attraction is the pool area on level 57. Again - views were spectacular but the place was very crowdedAll in all was a bit disappointed overall with the whole experience.",626
MBS,1,“Consistently poor service !”,"We are currently staying in the hotel for two nights, but I had previously stayed here a few months ago. My experience has been consistently the same and sadly a disappointment. About a week prior to arriving I phoned the hotel to merge two separate booking for our two night stay. One was made by my work and the other by me over the internet. When I phoned to ask to merge the two in their system I was told they couldn't find one of them and to call back each day to get the issue solved. I would have expected the customer service officer to take my details, sort it out and email me the outcome. Not on your life would they do that level of 5 star service!Next we arrived around 9:50 pm on Wednesday night. There was a whole bunch of people at the check in counter with little movement. Many seemed to have been there a while. We soon understood why as we waited for an hour to check in. I have never seen such a slow and completely non functioning process at work in a hotel check in. You would think that all persons had pre-booked, it should take little time to process them into a room. In the meantime the lack of organised queues saw people come along a push into the front of the queue, quite often with assistance from hotel staff. This was really annoying so late at night after a long flight.Next we checked in during which time we asked for a city view room. We were told there weren't any and that we could move to one the next day if we would come down to see the same customer service officer. I asked her to do it for us and call us to pick-up the key when ready and she refused and insisted we make time to go down and do it from scratch the next day. Poor service and I am getting the impression their system is very poor and causing the issues around checking in and out and does not facilitate servicing customers needs.Anyway, after going up to our room at close to 11pm at night, we found the card did not work and we couldn't get into the room. Back down to the reception to queue up again and get a new card made to try again. Then we entered the room and found it to be unusually small for a 47 sq m room as a lot of space was wasted at the front door.Next day we came back to our room and found the room key card didn't work again. Back to the reception and the queue. After enduring more pushing in we got a new card and entered the room.Then we went for a swim in the rooftop pool (very shallow 1.2m depth). Coming down we found the key didn't work in the lift. At 9:30pm we were forced to go down to the reception again to get a new key made. Excuses given were that the keys are really sensitive, although ours had only made contact with a towel. We went up to the room to find it didn't work. Back down to reception and a new key was made. This time the key worked.During my last stay in September with a colleague we both had similar issues with delayed check in and out times and key malfunctioning. It has got worse on this stay. Despite apologies no one really cares, just hot air.Given the money charged is for a 5 star hotel stay, we wont be using this property again. Better off going to a real hotel chain with some idea of service and global standards.Seriously disappointing!",100
MBS,3,“Uninspiring hotel - but top view”,"Weird hotel - never been to a place like this. Supposed to be a luxury hotel, and indeed rooms are nice with a fabulous view. BUT nothing glamourous there - especially not the clientele who goes there for the casino. Feels like just a number among an enormous crowd. More than 2000 rooms, queues for breakfast, pool is packed and unappealing. Feel in an airport more than an hotel. Though service is good. But still worth having a look at it - maybe not staying there. It's quite extraordinary really! The size of this place! But the view IS exceptional.",209
MBS,2,“Factory floor experience”,"The first step into the hotel lobby makes you think you just arrived on a tour of a factory production floor. It's crowded with people spilling all over and you wonder why you would want to spend your moolah there when the first impression doesn't match the hype you were expecting. it takes ages just to check-in or out, and you feel like you're in a queue in some sale at a shopping mall. Despite what they say on their website about having rooms of various configurations, your room reservation and requests are very much ignoredso be warned. It's all subject to availability when you check-in, which is a mantra not befitting their hotel category. That's their way to telling you that their cash cow is the casino, not your hotel stay. So be prepared NOT to get the room that you made a reservation for. The only draw of this hotel is the city view and the infinity pool. The overall experience is like staying in some first rate student hostel. For that, you're better off just visiting the hotel and not stay there. For a truly proper hotel stay with ambience and customer service, you will be better off with the other hotels in the same vicinity.",190
MBS,3,“A hotel with potential but needs improvement”,"I like the location of the hotel. The view from the room is beautiful if you ask for a higher floor. It's also a nice area to walk around. I was able to jog in the morning. However, the service can be greatly improved. The shuttle service at the airport was not good. I was told the shuttle would leave soon. When I rushed to get to the shuttle, I was told it won't leave for a long time. When I went back to the desk, I got no help. So I just took a taxi to the hotel. The bathroom is very dirty. I had to have it cleaned, but still not clean enough. I ended up buying some cleaning solution to clean it myself. Only in India I ran into the same problem and I certainly didn't expect this in Singapore. The hotel is very crowded and busy. I didn't like that. The pool is beautiful but again very crowded. Service in general is just OK. They are not rude but not friendly either. I stayed in many other hotels in Singapore. This one certainly doesn't measure up.",201
MBS,3,“Love the physical hotel. Everything else is just...meh.”,"What one of the previous reviewers said about being an uninspired money-making machine probably sums it up for me as well.The second time I have stayed here. This time I stayed in a Grand Room for a couple of nights. Huge room with a hugee balcony with a gorgeous views of the area(I bet it will be more awesome once the construction of the garden area is completed). The infinity pool is probably the pool with the best view ever. Service is just like any other hotel nothing spectacular nothing horrible. Bed is comfortable ( but I have had more comfortable beds before). Thats it for the good points.I do not really have anything extremely bad to say about the hotel. I guess this is what one should expect for such a huge hotel that probably runs almost full all the time. Why 3 stars? Because for the amount I paid I really would want something more. And although probably impossible , I would love to not share the infinity pool with hundreds of people at the same time. call me selfish.So -1 point for not having free internet and another -1 point for lack of value for what was paid.",353
MBS,3,“Uninspired money-making machine”,"Let me say first that this is a nice hotel and despite all the cricitisms I bring up, it is still a good hotel. It just does not keep up with similarly priced properties elsewhere at all. You'll only go for the huge infinity pool.The good:The pool, obviously. Simply stunning!The view from the rooms is nice. Get a city view room and watch the bay area light up at night.The rooms are medium-sized and comfortable. Good but nothing special. Service is friendly and helpful.The gym is excellent. Lots of machines, a large number of dumbells and weights stacks in the weight room, separate cardio room, spacious and with a great view. 5* all the way.The bad:The breakfast buffet is very small compared to other hotels in this price range. Not worth the 45 SGD.The door to my room did not always close by itself, I had to pull it several times because the lock did not click and it could be pushed open without a key.The aircon is very loud.The shower setting is mostly hot. You turn the knob a mile, then it goes very quickly to ice-cold. Not a huge problem, but again, not up to the standard the hotel wants to set.There are crowds of tourists in the lobby and the sheer size of the hotel with the casino and mall attached make it feel too much like a cash-cow and less like a luxury hotel.You need to switch elevators to get from the lower level rooms to the rooftop. The gym is in tower two, the spa in tower one. If you're not in those towers, you have to go down to the lobby and back up.No coffee machine in the room, just a kettle. Room service menu is the usual club sandwiches and chicken satay, a bit boring.The ugly:I just paid 600 bucks for a room and internet costs extra, in this day and age. Are you kidding me?Summary:Go once if you want to experience the pool which is amazing. Otherwise, there are better choices where you will get more for your money.Pro-tip:Go clubbing at \avalon\"" on the waterfront.""",203
MBS,3,“Honeymoon stay - unimpressed”,"My husband and I stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon. Upon arrival we were checked in swiftly. The room was small and unimpressive for its price, and for a hotel that was only around one year old, it looked very aged and dated. For some inexplicable reason the doorbell of our room kept ringing with no one being at the door. At 2am in the morning, this was incredibly disconcerting and we requested to change rooms. However, many phone calls later we were told there was not a single room with a king bed left in this hotel of three towers of 49+ floors. We were repeatedly offered rooms with two beds, and I had to keep repeating that we were on our honeymoon. This was not an enjoyable start to our honeymoon. The only things we enjoyed in this hotel were Sky on 57, SkyPark, and the boutique designer goods stores. Of the 7 hotels around the world that we stayed in for our honeymoon, this was the only hotel that did not make any effort to congratulate us or even acknowledge that we were on our honeymoon (champagne, fruit basket, chocolates, anything). We won't be staying here again.",355
MBS,2,"“More like a factory, than a luxury hotel”","We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for only one night (we are glad we stayed no more).The terrible service started the minute we walked out of out car. The car ramp was like a zoo with no order and children were almost getting run over. Once we finally got inside we were shocked at the 30 minute queue just to check in. Finally when it was our turn to check in we stood there for twenty minutes because they could not find the rooms we booked. Firstly they couldn't accommodate the two rooms on the same floor (one with children in them), secondly they could not find a room with city view in which we paid for. When it was three o'clock (the time to get our rooms) we came back to the check in desk after waiting two hours in a shopping mall, they then told us one of our rooms were not ready.When we finally got into our rooms we went to the Sky Park. No one can fault the beautiful view. However when we wanted to get into the pool we found there was no chairs to sit down on. We walked around for ten minutes trying to find a chair but there was none. So finally we sat down on a bench with many others away from the pool. When we finally got in the pool it was freezing, many were chattering. Also the pool was extremely crowded almost difficult to move in.When we tried to go to dinner there were no restaurants available and we were told all were fully booked. There was no element of service. Finally we sat down at a cafe in the busy hotel and the service was o.k. however the wait staff dropped things causing them to smash and they even forgot to give us plates after being given food.The rooms however were amazing with floor to city glass. The bathrooms were very large and very comfortable, there was a good selection of channels to choose from and the sleep quality I received was amazing.Check out was fine and parking ok,I will never go back.",737
MBS,3,“Vegas comes to Singapore”,"This hotel is owned the same group that owns the Sands in Las Vegas. As such it is more Las Vegas than Singapore. It has all the comforts. So many comforts, in fact that you need not ever go outdoors, but then why travel to Singapore at all?The hotel is simply enormous, and makes a distinctive profile on the Singapore skyline. You can't miss it. With the equally enormous enclosed mall with just about every name brand store you would see in any major city or hotel, it is truly over the top. But, you can save air fare and jet lag simply by going instead to the real thing closer to home: Las Vegas, Macaw, Monaco, Atlantic City.As a destination resort hotel, it checks all the boxes. If you are looking for a truly Asian experience, though, you should plan to at least spend your days elsewhere.This is not to fault the hotel for what it is. It is very clean, very efficient and very well run. It delivers it's product very well indeed. However by virtue of it's enormity and the high guest turnover rate, the service, although prompt and efficient is anonymous and lacking in warmth. You will not find lush, exotic Asian warmth and hospitality here.Some of the staff, especially those working in the lobby restaurants seemed harried. They clearly did not have the time to offer any more than perfunctory courtesy, and given the human tides pouring nonstop through the public areas, I could not blame them at all. The service was fine, but it was delivered without any warmth by people who know they will never see you again.You will get better and cheaper food from the food courts in the mall across the street, and even better and even cheaper if you just head for the Chinese, Malay or Indian Villages of the city proper. There are all easily reached via the MRT (subway)The food at the breakfast buffet is slightly above average. Again, it checks all the boxes but the dining areas are in the enormous lobby, with all the warmth and intimacy of an airport departure lounge. The experience was similarly soulless and anonymous, and as such, not enjoyable. The prices alone put me off room service, and off of the other smaller restaurants in the hotel proper.I ended up avoiding them all and instead walking over to the mall which has just about every kind of eating experience imaginable - steak houses, pizzas, French (althoughj I am not sure why one would go to Singapore for French cuisine) ,a local mini mart and an enormous Asian food court with good food at reasonable pricesThe view from the rooftop infinity pool is very impressive, just like in the brochure. Instead of paying the room rate, for S$20.00, you can buy a pass which will get you in. It is popular and very crowded, like any outdoor venue in Singapore. It is the view that makes it unique.As a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Marina Bay Sands is worth it for 2 or 3 days, max. But If you want to really experience Singapore, stay somewhere in the city. There is really nothing else in that part of Singapore aside from a small museum, a convention center and lots of construction. It may be nice someday. The problem is that the really interesting and historical parts of Singapore are 15 to 45 minutes away by taxi. The MRT (subway) is a 15 minute walk over the DNA bridge. An interesting experience . once.It is all very impressive at first glance. Having sampled it once. I will find a quieter, more genuinely Asian hotel the next time.If you do stay at the Marina Bay Sands, get an MRT pass, as you will be riding it frequently. The MRT is really cheap, modern, fast and efficient and is spotlessly clean and safe. Taxis are also inexpensive .for taxis. Traffic moves well.Despite the anonymity of the Marina Bay Sands. Singapore is worth visiting. There are few cities in the world that are more safe, more clean or more easy to get around. The well-known sites: The zoo, the botanical gardens, Sentosa Island and the Bird Park all definitely live up to their reputation. It is a very good place to combine a business and family vacation. I did just that, and was glad. If you get an opportunity to visit Singapore, by all means go.",234
MBS,2,“Disgusted!”,"Great structure, huge which includes three towers, casinos, shopping malls. Room very ordinary, typical of a 4 star hotel rooms we have booked only the bathroom was big, they will not even replenish the toiletries like soap, etc...unless you ask for it.oh the bathroom is not friendly, no bidet, nor telephone shower. They cannot even supply you with the 3 sets of towel, (bath, hand and wash cloth). They have a notification card whether you want your linen changed daily, this is only my pet peeve when I travel to have fresh linens, on the third day, the chambermaid slipped the card under the glass top of our bed side table, the glass was very heavy to lift, my smart granddaughter got the room service menu card, slipped it under the glass top to be able to get the linen card, viola! Then I was able to place it on top of our bed. One incident also was we left early that day just to find out when we returned by 4pm that our room was not made up yet!The hotel is so huge, I think it is undermanned. Lesson learned, never to book in a hotel/casino, it's like a market place! Oh the skypark, it's also another market place, for non hotel guests, you are allowed to go up as long as you pay 30dollars and you have a spectacular view of Singapore!",259
MBS,3,"“Hmmm - too big, staff struggle to cope but great views”","It's hard to know what to say about this hotel. Visually very impressive, great pool/bar area on the 57th floor, great room - huge - and we had a city view from the 41st floor which was incredible. However like others check in was a mess. We got stuck in line behind two men checking their families in who questioned everything. 45 minutes later we were still there. The lady checking them in had involved a supervisor who completely ignored the fact that other lines were moving way ahead of us and made no attempt to take the guests aside to sort out issues and allow us to check in. Very very disappointing. When my partner intervened to discuss wiuth the supervisor the guys got aggressive and the supervisor evaported into thin air. This hotel isn't cheap so this should not be allowed to happen. And actually this is the main problem with the place - it is vast, full of people gawping and pushing their way around and as a guest you are invisible. It is like being in a Disney theme park in the summer holdays. Sadly the fab view and great room couldn't compensate for the lack of personal service and atmosphere. Shopping area was huge but frankly not many people there even at the weeken. I wonder what this will be like in a couple of years time when stores aren't making any money. Next time I'd just go up to the viewing area and bar as this is the best thing about the hotel.",349
MBS,1,“Worse Hotel EVER!!!! Never again!!!”,"My husband had a conference at MBS so we stayed with them for 5 nights. When we arrived, bell man was right there to take our bags but when we tried to check in it took Forever!!! There was a long line and they could barely cope. When we finally got our room, we had to walk through this huge mass of humanity just milling around the lobby. If you are looking for a personal, elegant and classy hotel, this ain't it!Our room was on the 40th floor, nice view. The room however was sub par, considering this is a fairly new property. There were stains on the couch and throw pillows, yuck. They could have at least cleaned it. If you like a nice strong shower, forget it, the shower was LOW FLOW, tough if you are trying to get the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair and no tub. Also there was a constant bad odor wafting out from the sink.Breakfast selections were good, lots of choices but you would have to fight to get to the food. Children running all over and a couple of mornings, I saw people in their bathrobes having breakfast, Classy.Tried going to the pool, amazing pool, gorgeous views (again)but there were so many people it was impossible to to have a quiet and relaxing time. It was like we were at a water park. We never went back.I don't know if this is a 5 star property, it did not even seem like 3 stars. We are used to The Four Seasons, The Ritz, Park/Grand Hyatt so if you are too, please run the other way. We love Singapore and have been there many many times and will still be visiting her in the future and love the services the hotels there provide. I believe that MBS is too big, management and staff cannot cope with the sheer volume of guests. We will never return to MBS when there are so many other wonderful places in SIngapore to stay, just go across the bridge and you have the fabulous Ritz.",216
MBS,2,“Overated”,"Don't waste your money. Don't stay at this hotel. The architecture is most impressive, the rooms are quite good. However, the service is terrible. The staff give no information about accessing the pool on the 57th floor and the lifts stop at the 22nd floor. No indication about where the next lift well is. We finally found a cleaner to guide us. The pool area was crowded. Nowhere to change except the toilets. The pool has barriers to stop you swimming more than a few yards. It is full of people anyway. All public areas of the hotel are crowded with sight see-ers and there is not one chair on which to sit in the vast foyer as you wait for your taxi or whatever. Access to the shopping mall is through an underground tunnel but, we found this by accident after crossing the busy street in the rain. Again, the staff gave no information and one even told us that the road crossing was the only method. The breakfast at the hotel is way over priced. The hotel is positioned too far from the city. The shopping mall, (\Shoppes\"") is OK for billionaires but few practical shops for travellers. There are many good hotels in Singapore. This is not one of them. Try somewhere else.""",90
MBS,3,“A BIG BARN!!!!!”,This property is the biggest barn ever!!! Honestly the rooms are only 4 star and the service is so slack!!! Things are broken already and have yet to be fixed. The balcony in my room had no furniture. The pool is spectacular but the service is poor. I trust that when you are spending this amount of money you do expect more. I would never recommend staying here as it is way to far from the centre of Singapore and I believe you do not get what you pay for,48
MBS,2,“Absolute Chaos !”,"I stayed here with my family in October and I cant say I've ever stayed in a more chaotic place. Check in is chaos, the skypark chaos and the lift chaos. If your looking for relaxation dont come here. The shops and theatre are worth a visit though.",398
MBS,2,“You pay for the view!”,"I travel often for business and leisure and Singapore is one of my frequent stops, the hotels there are world class and service is second to none. I had never stayed at the Sands but had visited before for meetings with clients or to visit the casino where I hold a Premier Advantage card. I had received numerous invitations through the card to stay at the hotel but had never managed to fulfill as they were always fully booked. Attending conference at the Sands I decided to stay and managed to secure a booking for a Premier room. The only welcome I received was when I checked in and the remaining four days were lost as we joined the hordes descending on the hotel. The rate is expensive for what you get and that is not a lot compared to other Singapore hotels of note. My wife accompanied me on the trip and used the hotel facilities while I was at conference. The lack of free wi-fi was an expensive option as she attempted to finish some business and as a vegetarian was unable to find many options for food in the hotel restaurants. There is a lack of direction as to where you should eat and when we tried to join the roof top for breakfast were told in no uncertainty that we were not club guests and should go forth and join the bun fight downstairs. Boy did that make me feel welcome! I stay in club rooms all over the world but was not prepared to pay the sky high price here but for that matter was not given the option to upgrade either. The biggest gripe was the cleanliness of the room, it was vaccumed once in the four days and on two days we came back in the afternoon and found it had not been serviced despite leaving the service light on outside the door. It is probably the case that you are paying for the wow factor and the view from the roof top pool area which for a guest is like being in the middle of a stampede for most of the time. I will be returning to Singapore soon but will revert to the sanity and appreciation of being looked after by the staff at the Conrad who go that extra mile to make you feel welcome as a guest.",131
MBS,3,“Looks better on the onside than on the inside”,"Pros:- The pool, the pool and the pool. This is the most stunningly beautiful infinity pool I have ever seen. - The view facing the business district is absolutely gorgeous. Singapore has a beautiful skyline- Great gym on the 55th floorCons:- Location. Unless you are a gambler or looking to buy serious diamonds/watches there isn't much around the area. - The interior furnishings of the hotel looks rather sterile. Reminds me of an office building- I had to change elevators three times to get to the roof from my room.- There was no shower curtain/barrier to keep the water from splashing from the shower. You end of with a wet toilet- Not much amenities in the room. For what you pay the room you can only describe the room as blah.",80
MBS,3,“Big isn't better”,"Yes it's big. Yes it's structurally magnificent. Yes the infinity pool is the largest bla bla bla. Unfortunately the Marina Bay Sands lacks soul, character, charm, whatever you want to call it. Don't get me wrong, the rooms are approaching 5 star and the staff we dealt with were all nice and efficient, but we couldn't help feeling we were in an airport, such was the size and volume of people. It was an experience, but I wouldn't rush back.",409
MBS,3,“Stay Here for the Infinity Pool”,"It's true, it's true! All the bad reviews are true!1. CHECK-IN IS NOT A BREEZEIn fact, it was such a chore! We already arrived late in the hopes that lines would be more manageable but we clearly thought wrong. The only positive thing about waiting in line was the availability of free refreshments. 2. NOT SO FRIENDLY SERVICEOne would think that after making us wait in line for about 30 minutes, the check-in staff would be more pleasant or accommodating but this was also not the case. Every request we had regarding room preference was turned down and we even got the convention center as our view. 3. AVERAGE ROOMConsidering the grandeur of Marina Bay Sands, the room was a bit of a letdown. Granted that size of room was bigger than most Singapore hotels, the room looked generic and lacked character. Beds were small too. Also, much to our dismay, we were not even informed that we were billeted in a handicapped room! I would not have griped about this if not for the fact that the bathroom flooded every time anyone took a shower.4. THE SHOPPES = ZZZWhile I was at The Shoppes, I felt like I was walking inside a museum instead of being in the middle of a shopping area. Not much activity at The Shoppes and stores are not unique either. 5. SO-SO BREAKFAST EXPERIENCEAs if lining up during check-in was not enough, one also has to queue just to have breakfast. To be fair, there are no lines before 8 a.m. Also, there's another restaurant option at a different tower but food selection is rather limited. At Rise, food selection was not bad and buffet tables were replenished fast, but it has to be said that the food was ordinary. It missed the chance to showcase the good in Singapore cooking.But I forgot all my issues about the hotel when I went up the pool area... If only for the opportunity to swim at the magnificent infinity pool, I strongly encourage everyone to stay at Marina Bay Sands. The moment I saw the view from the pool platform, I finally understood why a lot of people are willing to put up with the less than stellar service one gets at Marina Bay Sands. Swimming at the infinity pool is an experience like no other and it's an experience that I would gladly share with anyone who cares to listen.For pictures, go to http://gluttonanonymous.blogspot.com/2011/10/night-at-marina-bay-sands.html",146
MBS,1,“keep your valuables with you!!”,"The top of our stay was valuable items stolen from our luggage checked in at the concierge!! Singapore out of all countries and places we've been to!Out of 4 nights we stayed there they forgot to clean our room twice. Incompetent staff insisting on you taking a taxi instead of helping with directions how to walk to the other side of the river (all of 200m!) via a phenomenally designed bridge. Lower floors are quite noisy, so you constantly hear the lobby/street noises in your room. Too busy breakfast area, impossible to get basic things like apples (which shine there for decoration purposes only but not available for guests)..... If you'd like to enjoy the view, just book a table at one of the restaurants on the top floor (we tried Sky 57 which was very nice and adequate!!), but don't even think of staying there!!!!",383
MBS,3,“Amazing massive hotel with the best views means they can relax on the service…?”,"To a certain point the title of my review is true. This is one of the newest coolest hotels in the world displaying architecture and views that are unlike anything I have seen anywhere. This reason alone means it’s probably worth going for a one or two night romp as I did last month and never return again. Must start by saying that if you do indulge and are prepared to spend the 500 bucks/night, then you should definitely dig a little deeper for an extra 200 and book a club room. This will entitle you to the full buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening canapés all served atop the sky deck. The service in that sky lounge is absolutely among the best I have experienced anywhere in the world! Staff always smiling and during the evening drink service I never saw the bottom of the three separate drinks I had going. Other service I experienced in the outside this sky lounge was extremely “so-so”… I put this down to the hotel being so big and like with any organisation of this size, you are just another number. If I’m spending $700+/night, I want to be treated at least like they are happy to see me…. Is that asking too much?! Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by an unhappy looking bell hop who made no attempt to help with our bags or point us in the direction of the reception. When we eventually found the check in desk, again it was a bunch of blank looks and actually felt more welcome when I bought a packet of chewing gum from the 7-Eleven down the street!Rooms are nice and clean and actually almost too big. Almost. We spent most of the time on the sky deck by the pool, which was awesome but because they allow members of the public to go up there and even have guided tours through there, you cannot go in or out without have the 3rd degree by one of the many security guards. I actually felt like I was 18 years old again and dealing with security at a backpackers. The above are the reasons why I am super glad I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and also the reasons I will never return.",328
MBS,3,“Disappointing...”,"After all the hype about Marina Bay Sands (MBS), I was quite excited to see what it was like for myself. We took the shuttle bus from the airport and arrived at the hotel to spend over half an hour in the queue waiting to check in. They served us drinks and given long stem roses (??) when we were waiting but that did not make up for the fact that after a long flight, we just wanted to get to our room.Finally we were led to our room which unfortunately was on the 2nd floor of Tower 3 overlooking the freeway - so much for the spectacular views. The room was typical of what you would expect from a hotel of this class but nothing special to write home about. One of the things that annoys me about hotel bathrooms is the lack of water pressure in the showers. Well, the one we had in MBS was like a trickle. I wouldn't say that we were disturbed by traffic noise but there was a distinct hum of cars on the freeway which the double glazed sliding doors could not completely eliminate.The hotel is huge which means that it is very busy with a lot of human traffic walking around the place. Definitely not the sort of hotel for people wanting peace and quiet!!On a more positive note, the hotel is well located next to a huge shopping complex with a lot of up-market stores, cafes and restaurants. Although the prices are high for food and everything else, it is convenient to have so much choice at your doorstep.What I enjoyed most about MBS was spending a couple of hours relaxing and swimming in the massive pool up in Skypark. The views are really spectacular and this in itself was worth staying at the hotel for. All in all, I did not regret my stay at MBS but it is unlikely that I would make a return trip.",467
MBS,2,"“Poor Service, inefficient and confused people”","I booked a suite with MBS for a mini birthday celebration and from the start to the end, there is nothing that made me want to go back anymore.First of all the problems started with the booking. Due to my tight working schedule, i communicated through email with the reservations department. Nobody bothered to reply my queries which were sent through email a few times, until I showed my dissatisfaction and anger through the email.Secondly, i booked with one credit card, but decided to pay with another on the day of checkout. And guess what, they still billed me on the credit card that i used to book with, and furthermore, with a double billing. I seriously wonder what the person at the check-out counter was doing and whether she did swipe the card that i passed her to pay. Thirdly, I requested for the cake to be kept with the concierge, and they were nice enough to do that for me. But when I wanted to get the cake back, they told me there was no such cake and i had to make several phone calls and they had to call me back several times before they \re-located\"" back my cake. And when they managed to re-locate my cake, the cake was delivered to my room only 20-30mins later. That's not very efficient.Fourthly, during the check-in, the benefits and privileges that we can enjoy that comes with the suite were not informed. The person at the check in counter did not bother to explain to us or even inform us the facilities that we can enjoy but merely pass me two key cards and asked for the next waiting person to come forward. And this happened at the VIP lounge. I don't feel very VIP-treated after all.I understand that the hotel is busy and bustling with visitors to stay. However, to maintain their standards as a world class hotel, the type of service and the people working there who are just too busy to attend to the very simple needs of individual people who stay there will just bring the reputation down sooner or later. I personally feel, for the amount of money that I paid and the service that I got, I will rather go to other hotels in the cities such as fullerton or mandarin oriental, that provides much better and efficient service as compared to MBS. I doubt i will ever want to come back again, unless there's another reason or experience to prove otherwise.The only part that's nice abt MBS is their rooms, being spacious and comfortable, and the view from the room was amazing. That's the only part where I enjoyed. All in all, there's nothing fantastic. Perhaps I'm the only unlucky one who experienced so many hiccups during the stay???""",250
MBS,1,“Can't handle their size”,"We arrived a day early for a conference. They did have a room-- at twice the conference price, but we took it. When we opened the door, the stench of stale nicotine practically gagged us-- we called to say we needed another room (having requested non-smoking), but couldn't wait in the room due to the smell. Arriving back in the lobby, we waiting in the check-in line for 45 minutes, to be told we could use a hospitality room to freshen up before dinner, but our luggage would take 30 min to be delivered. We rushed off to our dinner as we were... When we arrived back at the hotel several hours later, they assigned us another room (which also smelled-- unidentified-- when we entered, but we were exhausted-- only needed to have our luggage delivered--why wasn't it in our room already??). It took them 47 minutes to get it to us (near midnight-- we had arrived at 4 pm). The final indignity was bedbug bites-- ohmygoodness. The manager called, offering a suite, and was quite flustered when I turned it down. We moved to the Amara Hotel, where the service was exceptional and the prices reasonable, and the staff attentive and cooperative. Don't stay at the Marina Sands (other conference attendees I spoke with had complaints, as well-- only one other one did I know well enough--she's the one who mentioned her bedbug bites!) unless you want the proximity of the casino and won't spend any time in bed!!",290
MBS,2,“What a terrible disappointment”,"Architecturally and aesthetically, possibly the most impressive hotel in which I have stayed but that is where it stops. The infinity pool on the roof is wonderful but full of people, not swimming but taking photographs of each other, mostly making V signs with their fingers. Everything else about the Marina Bay Sands is sub-standard. It is just too big to be comfortable, the main concourse is crowded at all hours and there were hoards of people who appeared to be wandering aimlessly through the building. The service was poor to say the least, check out was the slowest that I have ever experienced; there was a huge queue and in the end, I trusted to luck and deposited my key card and a completed check-out form in the box provided. The food outlets which I used were not good and very American in style, great, if you like burgers and club sandwiches but if you are health conscious or a vegetarian, forget it. The bar prices were ridiculous, I estimate that the price in the hotel, for a local beer, after tax and service charges, is about twenty times the shop retail price! The one good thing was that at least I enjoyed plenty of exercise, just walking from one end of the huge building to the other.No doubt this stunning hotel will be a massive financial success for its owners, owing mainly to the gamblers who flock here to lose fortunes but I for one, was most disappointed. There are many excellent hotels in Singapore and so, steer clear of this glass monstrosity and try to find one where you are not just a number but a respected guest; you never know, someone may even remember your name.",124
MBS,2,“Stunning views..... but that's about it”,"This was the 2nd time at Marine Bay Sands and again everything from the queues at the reception, to the fact that you're being dumped in just a room as the opted for rooms were all \overbooked\"" is one big disappointment (takes you about an hour to sort it out) it's quite annoying that most of the staff are unable to deal with complaints and hide behind all kind of excuses. Skipping the negatives (and that's the main reason for coming back) the views from pretty much every point in the hotel are amazing with the pool being trully spectacular. I guess for a short trip its worth staying here (you'll be amazed), if you're looking for service and a little more don't go!""",352
MBS,3,“An architecural wonder with ? service”,"Marina Bay Sands has breathtaking architecture, spacious rooms & all amenities; a 70 meter infinity pool, jacuzzi hot tubs on the 57 floor with a sky park; many conference halls, a casino, a box office theater and a sprawling shopping mall with a river at one end and sea on the other. It has rooms in three 57 floor towers with underpass walkways connecting to the casino, mall and theater across the street. Perhaps due to the sheer size of this resort, the extremely polite staff can not provide personalized service. The check in with long queues and wait reminded me of standing in line at the supermarket pay counter. Further the concierge service could not keep up with the volume of guests leaving most of us carrying our own luggage to our rooms. For the price one pays for to be a guest at this 5 star resort, the service of a concierge is a foregone conclusion.The infinity pool, sky park and jacuzzi hot tubs on the 57th floor is a marvel. WOW ! The view is memorable and the crowd in and around the 57th floor makes this entire experience forgettable. If you think the crowds on weekdays are bad, just don't bother going to the pool on the weekends. I swam only twice in my 7 day stay. In casual conversation with the security guards on the 57th floor responsible for allowing in only those with a hotel key card the best time for a swim is 6 am. The pool opens at 6 am and closes at 11pm. The food is great. I ate in room service, breakfast at Rise restaurant and at the Ku De ta restaurant on the 57th floor. The laundry service, and the priority service is excellent. All issues of not working phones and losing TV cable service were restored efficiently and effectively. The free airport to hotel shuttle service is commendable. The stay has been a memorable experience but the unending mass of crowds made of guests and tourists visiting to experience the architectural wonder will keep me away from this lovely resort.",142
MBS,2,“Crappy Check-in”,"Check-in procedures is chaotic. It is simply not managed. Nobody really knows where the check-in queue is, so there are multiple queues for multiple counters. Some people knowingly or unknowingly cut the queue, and the receptionist actually closed her queue and told several guests who had already been waiting to go queue somewhere else.There are actually two places you can check-in (Tower 1 and Tower 3). Most people end up in Tower 1 and wait in a long chaotic mass of people at the counter but the queue is shorter and a bit more organized at Tower 3. The hotel staff do not assist guests to the shorter queue.It's embarrassing for such a large reception team to fail in managing basic queue management. Movie theatres have much smaller front desk teams and they can manage the queues better, without the additional frills.",88
MBS,1,“Room with a view...and a used condom”,"We will never forget our stay at Marina Bay Sands - our small children found a used condom on the floor of our room. We were disgusted. Yes, the architecture is amazing, however hotel itself is poor - long wait to check in, the lack of cleaning that resulted in condom left in our room, long wait again to have someone attend to that problem, long wait for service around the pool and a mini bar charge on our account that we still do not know what for.",698
MBS,3,“The Service Standard has Dropped”,"I have recently stayed at the Sands Marina Bay for the third time in Club and was disappointed. If you have never stayed before then this hotel will be a treat. If you want what comes with staying in Club and your are used to it you may be disappointment. This disappointment comes from the room which wasn't cleaned properly. There had obviously been a fire in the shower cubicle and the black marks were still on the floor which look filthy. The bathroom still smelt of smoke and we were in a non-smoking room. The toilet back up the moment when turned on the shower as soon as we arrived and flooded the bathroom. This is the second time the toilet has backed up in a club room and flooded the bathroom. Might be a problem in this hotel.Seeing it was an overnight stay and I was tired I just took my son up to the 56th floor where the swimming pool toilets were. I tried to explain the troubles with the room on check out in the VIP lounge but the young lady was not interested as I believed she thought I was trying to get a discount. The same response we received last time when we reported the toilet backing up. The VIP lounge check out was extremely slow. The club lounge was very good with some very attentive staff yet the service has drop a bit in there. The food in the club lounge is always brilliant so the chefs always save the day. Unfortunately, when you are a guest in the hotel there is no way of distinguishing you from the tourists on the ground floor hence, when you asked to speak with someone you might have to wait a long time after some people are just asking the price. Then conceierge may forget you and walk away. This has happened many times so don't feel disappointed that you do not get good service on the ground floor. The hotel needs to sort out a way of having the tourists go to a particular desk and the rest service the actual paying guests. The restaurants down stairs also become full at times, so as a guest you will get turned away whilst others are just coming for a meal. Not sure what the hotel can do about this but it is a little annoying as a guest trying to get a meal downstairs and the place is full. Hence, you have no other option but to eat in you room all go up to club. Going up to the club is lovely but not in the rain as the lifts become flooded and the rain pours straight in so you have to make a made dash to the club lounge which is difficulty when you are in a cast and on a walking cane like I was. Basically, for first timers - go for it, you will love it. The added bonus for this hotel is the airport check-in facilities across the road but be warned they do not operate on a Tuesday or Wednesday. I found this out the hard way when the porter took my bags down there knowing I wanted to check in and then saying, \Oh Gee, sorry forgot\"". The check-in facilities were the only reason I wanted to stay this time and I wasn't impress when I found out it was closed. I thought walking on a cane with my young son it would make it easier to check-in but it wasn't too be. The porter then tried to hi-jack my bags back to the hotel. He handed me a card and said pick up the bags at tower 1. I just looked at him and said, \""What?\"" He started to roll the trolley with my bags on it back to the lift and I had to stop him so he could unload my bags. He was obviously in a hurry and I was just a mother, with a cast and a walking cane so he was going to tell me what I had to do. Eventually I had the bags put on the bus to the airport.""",171
MBS,2,“Over rated hotel.”,"The staff choose guests to serve. So make sure you put on your diamond rings & carry all your branded inorder to receive good service. They provide sub=standard services to different guests. Once I checked in to the hotel using VIP lounge but was in my casual attire, I asked to upgrade my room as I was a VIP memeber with free entitlment of free upgrading. The front desk staff say I book the deluxe room then they will only give me a deluxe room. I explain to her say I got free entitlement but she just tell me it's subjuct to availability. So I walk away & check in at the other counter, She call the counter I was standing to stop the other staff from giving me a free upgrade. I was so pissed to tell the staff I will pay for the upgrade. End up I pay extra S$1200+ for 3 nites stay at the Junior suite room. The total 3 nites stay, I spend more then S$5k.",111
MBS,3,"“A must stay at least once but very unfortunately, probably never again after your first stay.”","My title probably says it all. It's probably a must to stay at this hotel at least once in your lifetime but at the same time, it's very unfortunate that it would probably be the first and last time for most should they choose to stay at this hotel. It's over-rated, over-priced, with shoddy room service and overall service standards and a real bore if gambling is not one of your hobbies. The pool while obviously gorgeous, is not fit for swimming at all while the shopping at MBS is just ok. For what you end up paying for, you would be much better off paying for St Regis or Shangri-la.",647
MBS,1,“The worse hotel ever.”,"Many people rate this hotel a good one or even great one to stay at. My experiences from a year ago are still clear in my mind. It wouldn't be so bad if the memories were good, but I left feeling let down by the service, unappreciated as a guest and unfulfilled by my experience there.I am not the kind of person who would simply moan if my bathroom towels were dirty, or if the sheets didn't fit the bed. I would even let the whole issue of wifi connection being useless and rooms not vacuumed slip by too. It takes a lot for me to get on my high horse and write this review. I've thought about this for over a year, and I think it's time that I share my experiences of this supposed to be magnificent hotel.On my arrival in Changi I knew I had to take the coach from the airport. That was fine. I was impressed by the sight of Marina Bay Sands. The architecture and workmanship of the actual building is a piece of art. On arrival at the hotel, the coach parked below at a massive car park. At this point, I felt like I was entering a space ship. There were so many people from all over the world had arrived the same time as me. I felt small, which is understandable, being a large complex with three hotel towers connected by a gigantic atrium. The experience of amazement for me, probably lasted up to then.Checking in was a long a drawn out process. It reminded me of long queues leading to immigration. That to me, was still understandable. I got to my room, and wow, what a view. Singapore city as my backdrop, fantastic. My first sign of warning came from a guest I shared my lift with. She left the restaurant complaining how it took 45 minutes for her to get a glass of milk, only because it was not on the menu. I thought to myself, bureaucracy gone mad. I remained with an opened mind and continued on. The next day, I got up ready for my morning workout, when I found the key chain for my room would not undo. I tried my best to undo the clip, but it was jammed. I then called front desk, and waited a good hour. I couldn't wait any longer, so I called my father, in Malaysia. He managed to talk me through ways of manipulating the chain it's self to unleash it, which I finally did. On my way down to the gym, at the lift, which was an hour plus by then, only then was there a technician of some sort to assist me. I thought to myself, good thing I wasn't having a heart attack.After that my overall experience was totally disappointing. I felt like I was part of the herd of cattle being gathered and told where to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. The restaurants in the lobby lacked character. The staff seemed over worked and just wanted to get their job done. The swimming pool, the key structure was amazing to look at, but so were the crowds of in house guests and visitors from outside who came to enjoy this tourist spot too. I was there alone, so I didn't feel comfortable going for a swim for very long, leaving my valuables on display. My father came to visit me the following evening, and he was thoroughly disappointed by the service, or lack of it. We were in Singapore the following weekend, where we had already made reservations for the expensive poolside restaurant. Nobody had heard of us, we spent a long time on the phone waiting to be put through, and it seemed that in Singapore, where Customer Service is usually of high priority, it was lost in this place completely.",63
MBS,2,“First time in Singapore”,"Stayed @ Marina Bay Sands Tower Suite. For an extremely expensive hotel it is poorly run.Suite was small, TV did not work, had to call to clean room @ 4 pm. Poor service. There is no set organization. Restaurants are completely overpriced. Stay away from \Santi\"" restaurant, had terrible meal with a very expensive price. Would not go back to hotel or restaurant.""",571
MBS,3,“Nice.... but not worth it unfortunately.”,"We booked a Club room at Marina Bay sands as a stop over on our way back to Sydney from the UK. After our 14 hour flight all we wanted to do was to check in, have a shower and a quick bite to eat. We arrived at Singapore airport to be collected by the hotel bus which was nice and watched a video on how the hotel was a modern day built miracle. We arrived at the hotel at 6.30pm well after the 3pm check in. We had paid $1585.00 for 2 nights to stay in a \Club room\"" which includes breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapes, We were very excited about the hotel and even more excited about the amazing roof top pool.When we arrived at the hotel, it was like a circus people everywhere and nobody to help you.On check in we were told at 6.45pm that our room was not ready and that we had to wait between 1-2 hours. This is when things went from good to bad very quickly. I am not sure that after 3 hours past normal check in, why our room was not ready. I was starting to get a little mad when they kept saying sorry we have no rooms ready. They then offered to pay for us to have dinner in the restaurant and wait, but after a 14 hour flight, being hot, tired and in need to have a refreshing shower I was not happy to sit there and have dinner in the state we were in. They then offered us a room with 2 single beds...yes for a happily married couple who wants single beds??? We were meant to say in a King size Club room on the 37 floor and that's what I paid for and wanted. I think that, that is reasonable. We when got offered a Suite room on the 14 floor. At this stage I was over it and over Marina Bay Sands even before I had checked in. Keep in mind that we were at the check in for 1 hour as the young man behind the desk had to check and recheck and call someone on the phone, and then call the manager who then also called someone on the phone. All of this was about 1 hour of people who seemed to have no idea how to handle this simple problem. I must say I was very reserved, unforgettably the man next to me was shouting so loud that even I felt scared as he was being told the same thing, that his room was not ready....We had dinner at the buffet which was over $250 and on the second night pizza in the hotel restaurant which was $140 yes for pizza. I am happy to spend money but it was very expensive. My advice is not to eat in the hotel or the shopping center that is also owned by the hotel and venture outside to eat.The service from the hotel staff who working in The Club room eatery was very good and the food that was included was very nice.The pool was amazing and was really the only reason that made me book this hotel.In the end if you want the experience go for it, but we will not be staying or recommending it to our friends. We were a little disappointed in the Los Vegas of Singapore..""",407
MBS,1,“Terrible service at such an expensive price”,"My partner and I booked a club room for one night and took the ''free'' bus to the hotel. Firstly we stopped at every terminal for about 5 - 10 mins which was a huge waste of time and nobody got on the bus at terminal 2, 3,or budget. This irritated me extremely as it was my birthday we had shelled out 700 dollars plus and had to wait a very long time to get to the hotel. Another couple commented they should have shelled out for a taxi.Then arrived at the hotel eventually and asked for directions. Staff member viewed our itinerary sheet which was clearly marked club and directed us to check in. This happened another two times as we felt the directions were wrong. I also asked where club check in was and was directed to the wrong counter. Once we had checked in we commented we wanted to go to the club. The member of staff said we could have afternoon tea in our room (like I wanted to shell out for mini bar when we had bought a club room). Directed us to a lift which didnt go directly to the club so we walked back to a lift directly to the club.Once we finally reached the floor with the club a member of staff directed us to ku de ta when we asked for the club lounge thankfully we realised thsi otherwise we could have accidently spent hundreds on drinks. Found out later you can transfer lifts on the 55th floor. However I feel thats fine if you didn't buy a club room and you just want to see the pool but we had paid one of the top rates.Everytime we went into the club the staff were very snobby and asked us in an accusing manner whether we had club access and our room number.The club did serve nice food however the vibe in the club was so pretenious I felt out of place and I have been to hotel clubs before.The pool was ok but too crowded and very cold.The view at night from the pool area and surrounds is very romantic.One postitve note was that the hotel bus also takes you back to the airport and the porters took our bags directly to the bus.Overall I am very disappointed and will probably never go back to this hotel even though I am going to the 2012 formula One.",96
MBS,1,“this hotel is overrated!”,"Terrible hotel, room is dusty, pillows and carpets have disgusting stains (see photos). For a permium price, I expected a lot better, I was shocked at the quality of this hotel! the staff was super friendly though (especially the filipino ladies), but the buffet breakfast is horrific, check-in was a nightmare (got my room at 6am, I waited 3 hours to have my room ready), and despite having check-in late, they forced me to check-out at 12noon, very nice... fitness center was below average (sauna & steam is too small, can only fit 2 grown men)",255
MBS,2,“Unimpressed with service and charged for breakfasts - no response since”,"The hotel was full for the F1 race. We had asked for a room overlooking the race track but no mention of this when we checked in and we discovered when we got to the room that it did not overlook the track. Then 2 frustrating days wehn the keycards just would not work for the lifts or our room. We spent our time trudging back and forward to the front desk to get a new keycard to only have thesame problems. The lack of service on this issue reached facical levels when I phoned from the phone near the elevators on our floor to say the card did not work to let us into the room. The security man finally came and confirmed that it did not work then told us to contact front desk for another one - this was about the fifth time this had happened so off I trudged again. What a shocker.Our room was not turned down one evening despite not having the \do not disturb sign on\"".My husband was persuaded to do the Quick check out, but when the bill arrived, we had been charged for breakfasts despite confirming twice with the restarants that breakfast was included. I have emailed the hotel twice to get this issue sorted but no response. So I've been charged S360 for breakfasts that I would not have chosen to eat in the high priced restarant if I had been advised correctly. Nice hotel but such a pity that things continue to go wrong.""",191
MBS,3,"“It's good to stay to experience, but I won't go back.”","Marina Bay Sands can't compare to any other hotel under SANDS group. Venetian and Palazzo are much better than Marina Bay. However, their skypool is still amazing. This is the reason for me to stay at this hotel during my visit in Singapore. My cousin and I love the skypool. You need to stay at the hotel to get the access to the pool as well. If you want to take great pictures, I recommed you to go there during the day. Their front desk service is not that good as well. I guess they have to handle to many guests everyday, so they forget how to smile. I love their poolside, restaurant, and doorman services. They are all helpful and friendly. If you take Taxi to/from Marina Bay Sands, you will need to pay S$3 surcharge. I would recommend you to take bus #97 to MRT station and take MRT. You can also walk there. Especially, if you need to go somewhere during 5pm-8pm. The gov charge you ERP(it's like toll charge) and the taxi fare bumps up 35%. I would stay there to experience it, but I won't return.",93
MBS,3,“Overhyped!”,"Booked MBS for 1 night as a birthday surprise for my wife !It took us 2 hrs in check-in queue to get room key etc..Hotel lobby was packed , almost like a train station of a big metro city.Infinity pool had infinite number of people , more than you'll find in any waterpark resort.Equally frustrating was to get a place in top floor restaurants .Probably a bad timing with school holidays etcAvoid booking this hotel in peak period - if you are looking for a quiet, calm , away from crowd kinda holiday.",300
MBS,3,“Over-rated experience”,I agree with recent comments by some other reviewers. There is no doubt that the view and the pool are fantastic - unique even - but after an hour or so as a customer/guest I was looking for something more substantial from this place and never found it. The staff were almost all either in a constant state of anxiety from over-work or inexperience and never really presented a competent handle on the process of making us feel at home [Except the lady at breakfast]. We were locked out of our room for 1/2 an hour and the person who let us in was not the one we called but a bell hop who just happened to pass by. Then it took 3 attempts - I mean three attempts for the kids to bring us a jug of fresh milk for our tea in the room. AND don't mess with the contents of the fridge to try and put say the milk or bottled water in there - it is on a sensor system where anything moves in the fridge and it is immediately charged to your account. NO matter whether you take it out to drink or not. At the end of our stay driving out in the bus from the massive underground parking area we saw the owners RR parked strategically in the main exit. All the buses and cars having to negotiate around it. There is no doubt in my view that this was a crass statement of control and status by the owner (who of course is entitled to park where-ever he likes) which said - Yes you can stay here but your convenience (and in the case of the staff - your jobs) is reduced to negotiating around MY CAR as you leave. Enough said.,89
MBS,3,“Overated and poor service”,"We stayed for 3 nights in Marina Bay Sands. There were no bell boys to help us with the luggages. The room was modern but cheaply constructed. Things like light fittings and furniture were starting to break down already. The lobby was was very ordinary and was packed with guests came to the hotel to gamble. Casino was cold, dark and intimidating. Not like Las Vegas at all. The sky pool was the best highlight. One night was enough to experience the sky pool. Better to spend money elsewhere.",82
MBS,2,“poor quality rooms”,"this was a quick escape with my son for the week-end. As I checked in there were no more rooms available with the city view even though I made a reservation with advanced payment. In alternative they gave us a highway view room. Probably still under maintenance as one of the curtains was off and there was hammering all afternoon. No one from house keeping showed up. I'm wandering how they got the 5 stars? Not going back, not recommending to anyone.",271
MBS,3,“Sea of people”,"I stayed at the MBS in Nov 2010, so it has been a while and I hope they have ironed out the kinks in service / system since then. First, the pros:1) Beautiful building, definitely salute Singapore for a most impressive addition to their skyline2) Beautiful sky park. Amazing pools, great views.3) Spacious rooms4) Great access to shopsThe Cons:1) Too many people (but given it is part of a casino, this should be expected). The sky park is constantly packed with people (and I mean packed!). Only time I could actually swim laps in peace was between 630-730am. Can't even relax and take in the views in peace past that time2) Very big hotel - a lot of walking, especially if you get a room in Tower 3 and need to walk to the gym / coffee house for breakfast3) Not very organized, given the size which is probably overwhelming for the staff. Case in point - someone was checked in to my room at 11am on the day I was meant to check out. Person happily sauntered in to my room with a key card that was already activated, and it was not even past check out time yet. Complained at front desk when I checked out and all I got was a nod in apology. Apparently this had happened to other people before me (I was told when I related this story to friends)My verdict?I won't recommend staying here if you are not a keen gambler. A visit for the obligatory photo is sufficient, I feel. Many nicer hotels in Singapore that will give you a more restful stay.",373
MBS,3,"“5 star hotel, 1star service.”","We stayed at the Marina bay sands for a weekend as a treat for my wifes birthday.The hotel itself is truly amazing, the lobby is unbelievable. We had a room on the 35th floor facing the South China sea and on a clear day you can see the island of Batam, it was a wonderful view, the room was well presented and very spacious, the bathroom well equipped, and it was bigger than most hotel rooms! The sky deck on the 57th floor, where the infinity pool is located, is out of this world and something that will stay with us for along time, apart from the pool there is a garden area, several jacuzzi's(that look out to the South China sea) and 3 bar/ restaurant areas, the downside to the sky deck is that part of it is open to the public (not the pool area) and so is does get very congested, which took away from the experience for me.The other issues I had with the sky deck, was that it took nearly an hour to get a drink, as I don't think they have enough staff serving around the pool area, I only counted 4 waitresses, yet there were 5 lifeguards!, also there was music playing from the main restaurant behind the pool which was quite loud, now I love to listen to music, but as it seemed to to jazz constantly playing, it did start to grate on me somewhat.The other issues with the hotel were that even though it stats that check in is from 2:30pm we couldn't get into our room until 4:30pm and we had to get our keycard re-programmed as it would not work(It is required to operate the lift), it seems as though they don't have enough staff for the size of the hotel, and so the staff that are there, seem to be overworked and stressed, I would of thought that a hotel of this standard with the \sands\"" name behind it would have been more organised, maybe they need a little more time to iron out the kinks, but for me I will stick with shangri-la hotels when I am visiting Singapore as the staff are the best I have ever encountered.""",177
MBS,3,“Too big to be hospitable”,"The facilities, especially the sky pool, of this hugh hotel/resort/casino complex are indeed excellent. Not to mention the casino and the theatre. However, it is too big and crowded - have to queue up at check-in, check-out, breakfast (for a table and then for the food, feel like Oliver Twist) and ordering at the food court. The reception and concierge were indifferent, if not impolite. Buses are infrequenty and the nearest MRT station is some 15-20 minutes away if I walk, taking a taxi from the hotel was usually easy but not the other way round. I was assigned a spacious room with nice view and a connecting door (a double door as claimed by the hotel) with another room. Unfortunately, the double door is not enough to stop the noise of the group teenage neigbours who started loud party every midnight. I had to change to a smaller room (because they didn't have rooms of the same size) in order to be able to sleep. Try to avoid such this type of room at all cost.",443
MBS,2,“No five star experience”,"A couple of friends and I booked a Deluxe Room at the MBS for a Christmas get-together. The hotel was fine because it was new so everything was nice and clean. However, the service staff really gave us a hard time. 1. Bad experience with the Front Office - The check-in time was stated as 2pm on our confirmation letter but there was no room for check-in when we arrived and we had to wait 4 hours at the lobby. The front office staff did not bother to inform us that the room was ready and we had ask before we were given our room. When we asked for late check-out, we were asked to pay. If we had checked in on time, it would be fair. But having to waste four hours of our time with no service recovery, I don't think they value their guests.2. Bad experience with the Concierge - Our baggage was supposed to delivered to our room, but we waited for 45 minutes and still nothing came. We had to call a couple of times before the bell boy delivered our baggage. What was worse is that the bell boy doesn't seem to know that we were already in the room and he opened the room door himself.3. Bad experience with the Valet - the valet and Front Desk each gave us a different carpark rate for hotel guests. Apparently there was a change in rates which was not communicated properly internally and the staff themselves were confused.4. Bad experience with Room Service - we called to ask for ice buckets and were told that the first is complimentary and the hotel charges for the 2nd bucket onwards. Maybe this is a new standard with a 5 star hotel that I'm not aware of. But I find it a joke for them to even say that they are charging for a bucket of ice.5. Bad experience at the swimming pool - absolutely no sense of luxury except for the view. There were visitors loitering around the swimming pool taking pictures and just enjoying the view. No doubt this is a spectacular view and probably the hotel used it as an attraction. It feels like a family hotel with kids running around and tourists loitering around taking pictures and making noise. Exclusive 5-star experience? Not a bit. You probably need to go in the wee hours to have some quiet time at the pool. And you only get two cards to access the pool at one time. So it doesn't work well if you're travelling in threes.Overall, it was a disappointing experience - we expected Sands to do better.",76
MBS,3,“Good hotel but not a worthwhile stay”,"Of course anyone visiting Singapore would love to stay in Marina Bay Sands. However, if you are going for vacation, there is no point staying in this hotel which is quite far away from tourist hotspots and city centre. Other than the rooftop infinity pool and the casino, there is nothing attractive in this hotel. In fact, such a huge hotel has no great food to offer. Nice rooms, new property and good for luxury stay.",100
MBS,3,“Overpriced”,"It's all hype. Room was unexpectedly small, bathroom size was okay. Bed wasn't king as advertised. There was a huge balcony with no furniture. Opened the doors and it was so noisy, there was also no view but construction. In the shower, there was only an overhead shower, no handheld. Water temp adjuster was broken. It would have been alright if the AC didn't turn to Econo in the middle of the night making the room sooo hot!The skypark & pool was amazing w/ breathtaking views of the city. It was rather crowded though. The attached mall was a convenience.",494
MBS,3,“For something different!”,"Marina Bay Sands is an experience; the architecture, rooftop pool and views are unique. I’d read recent reviews and as a result had low expectations. In many ways it was better than expected, however, it isn’t well equipped for families. If we were staying as a couple my ratings would be higher. Arriving at Singapore Airport we attempted to use the free shuttle. The coach area is a long walk from the arrivals area, situated at the end of Terminal 3. The driver told us we were facing a wait of 15 minutes for other passengers to arrive and then possibly a similar wait at Terminals 1 and 2. We quickly decided to take a cab, which was less than $20 and well worth it for a comfortable 15 – 20 minute trip.The lobby is spectacular with soaring ceilings. There were no queues at check in but we experienced some difficulties with our room. We are a family of 4 and had booked a Horizon Deluxe room to guarantee a high floor. Reception advised we had been upgraded to a larger room that would accommodate 2 separate beds for the kids and a king for us. Sounded great, until I asked which floor? The 3rd floor of the hotel was not acceptable, no views and noise from the lobby. Second option was a room on the 47th floor but with only a king and one single bed (enough said). Third try and we were given a room on the 27th floor, city facing with 2 double beds. Unfortunately double beds at Marina Bay Sands are smaller than normal making for a very intimate and somewhat uncomfortable nights sleep. My advice, do your research and if booking on the net or using a travel agent be crystal clear what type of room you are reserving down to the bed configuration and be ready to stand firm with documented evidence of same. The room itself was lovely, new, clean and well equipped with a large bathroom. The views over the city were spectacular and the laser light show fun to watch. Housekeeping was very late (after 3.30pm each day). It’s disappointing to return from sightseeing to find the beds unmade. Breakfast was included in our tariff. We ate at the Tower 3 restaurant the first day. It was less crowded than Rise and had a better selection of Western and Asian food. It was obvious that the hotel is trying hard to manage the queues but Rise makes things difficult with a very small and cramped ‘egg’ area, resulting in long waits for omelettes etc. The rooftop pool was spectacular and fun to experience, day and night views are wonderful. We’re glad we experienced Marina Bay Sands. It’s clear the hotel is trying to address the long queues etc but bottom line it’s a very large and busy place. If we go back to Singapore, we’ll choose a hotel more suited to a family of 4.",228
MBS,3,“Great bastion of capitalism but lacks soul!!!”,This hotel I had great expectations for. But every experience from the check in to check out was poor. I queued for 45 mins (as at the check in desk for a low cost airline) to check in to my room only to be told that the room would not ready till mid afternoon at least. I was asked to leave my baggage at the left luggage service with another queue. No offer of assistance. Check in person did not know what she was doing. Very crowded lobby lacking the personal touch one might expect for the price paid. I might as well have been in Kuala Lumpur Central Market! Would have been much cheaper. Although the booking clearly stated in room internet and breakfast was included this was repeatedly strongly disputed by the check in personnel. No offer of obtaining clarification from the agent. Left it to me to sort. Room nice and view great. Room service slow. Room not cleaned till well in the afternoon.Parents with kids ..... watch out ... minibar on an antiquated weighting system so any movement of merchandise results in cost without recourse to logical discussion.Sky bar is spectacular but very pricey (£13 for a tiger beer)! Quite noisy too but a very enjoyable evening.Check out very impersonal - might as well have had automated check out kiosks! VERY GLAD TO LEAVE,421
MBS,3,“A big hotel but a disappointment”,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands from 21 July to 24 July 2011 with my husband and family. As our flight arrived Singapore early in the morning, I knew we were normally allowed to check into the room of any hotel in Singapore at the earliest around noon, or sometimes they let us in early if a room was being made available. So we left our baggage with the concierge and went to sit in the food court of the shopping centre which was adjacent to the hotel. We were being advised to come back to the front counter to register to check in. At 1pm, we went back to the front counter, we were registered and were told to come back at 3pm to get the card key to the room. At 3.30pm we went back to get the card key, was only given the card key at around 4pm. Went up to the room on 26th floor, only to find that the people occupying the room were not meant to check out yet. So we had to go down to the front desk to get another card key to another room. At the time we got the card key to a new allocated room was at 5.30pm. I was dead tired. As we checked out on 24 July at 10am,, we left our baggages with the concierge as we only needed to leave for the airport at 12.30pm. When we came back to pick up our baggages, the concierge was kind enough to push our baggages down to the bus terminal for the airport. As we were about to board the bus, my husband realised that my son's bag was missing. He went back with the concierge to search for the bag at their stores but to no avail. 45 minutes were passed and I was getting anxious of missing our flight. In the end, my husband found the bag sitting on the floor in lobby one. The concierge must have dropped it while he was pushing the trolley into the storage without realising about it. I nearly missed my flight and was running my life into the boarding gate. After all that I went through, will I stay there again? Never. There are so many nice hotels in Singapore. I go to Singapore 3 to 4 times in a year, why do I have to pay top dollar to stay at a place where I don't feel good? Never never again will I stay at Marina Bay Sands.",189
MBS,3,“Beautiful structure fun for Singapore”,"This hotel is worth staying at just for the rooftop pool and stunning views. This is a huge hotel - very Vegas (multiple elevators to different floors, lots of tourists walking around just having a look). I had arranged for airport transfers and the service was fantastic. Upon arrival at the hotel I was upgraded to a suite which was a treat, but the suite had issues. The TV was missing in the bedroom and some lamps didn't have lightbulbs...overall it just didn't seem ready for guests. I think the problems existed because the hotel had just opened. They quickly moved me to a different suite with a great view on a high floor and everything was in working order.The rooftop bar at night is a scene. Very fun place to drink while you drink in the city views. Hanging out at the pool in the daytime was a highlight. You really cannot beat the view and the service was good as well. It is a busy hotel, so if you are used to one of the more classic Singapore hotels this might not be the place for you.",140
MBS,3,“Great!”,"I came to Singapore for a 5 days trip recently. Overall a good stay, I was given a beautiful room with a splendid view of the Marina Bay and housekeeping did a great job of keeping my room clean everyday.The service was average if I rate my overall experience, but I would like to commend a particular agent at the Front Desk. Mugilan was very friendly and effective. He assisted me with my requests early in the morning with a smile. Definitely great service from him! And such a beautiful skypark! It's definitely worth staying here, for the beautiful views from the hotel. The only negative thing is the location. Marina Bay Sands is not exactly the most convenient place to stay in, and the front desk queues are always long. But not a bad choice for a holiday indeed!",179
MBS,3,“Great pool but overall service not up to mark”,"Be prepare to pay 5-star price for this hotel and get a 3-star type of service. I believe all staffs are well trained but the number of guests in this hotel at any 1 time must be too much for them. Staffs are very attentive to your needs during the non-peak time. You got to queue up for check-in and check-out (approx 30mins). I never seen so much people in a hotel lobby before - it looks like a train station. I stayed in Tower 3 - the room is ok, average looking and a reasonable size. Bathroom is very basic - nothing to shout about. Not luxurious enough to command that kind of price. However, i am very impressed with the pool at the top floor minus the crowd (very crowded). There is no way you could swin but the view will knock you off. Ordered some food at the pool area - food ok, service quite fast. Overall comment, will still come back here to stay because of the casino and the good restaurants in this hotel.",333
MBS,3,"“Weigh the Novelty of New and Big against Big Crowds, Slow Service”","Many reviews of this hotel trumpet the novelty of the new, big, sleek hotel. So here you can get a different perspective, and be prepared to make the trade-off. When you try the new and novel and big, you are likely to trade down very dramatically in the service and overall value department!As a frequent traveller, I value the chance to check in quickly, check out quickly. In this hotel, with all of the package tours and mobs of tourists, don't expect that to happen. When I went to check in, the lines were not particularly long, but it was still a long wait. From what I could decipher, most of the discussion on check-in was \does the room have this, does the rate line up with my package tour quote, etc\"". A lot of wasted time. And time that's wasted - we can never get back.Breakfast - again - tons of people - and expensive!. A very nice buffet, but be prepared to be walked into, jostled and blocked by the mobs of \""looky loos\"" that want to scrutinize everything carefully before finally making a selection. If you're on a leisurely tour - that may be fine for you, but if you're on any kind of a schedule - forget it. You want to get in, get out, get done.On check-out, I had no delay, but it was early - around 8AM. If you check out later - leave plenty of time.Oh - then there is the novelty factor - You can read all of the other wide-eyed reviews that marvel at the roof top pool.My room was comfortable, clean and way overpriced.Other hotels that are more centrally located and much more service oriented are the Shangri-La and the Mandarin Oriental. Centrally located also means close to the MRT stations. If you have never tried the MRT (Subway type rapid transit), by all means do so. It is clean, quick, easy to use, and will get you to many places very quickly.""",357
MBS,1,“second time marina bay sands and service still unacceptable!”,"my husband and I stayed this june the second time at marina bay sands since the location is close to his office. the first time we stayed in feb. this year the hotel lacked of staff ( every time you call either room service, concierge you will be in line for at least 5 min. until somebody picks up the phone) so it seemed there is only one person handling the entire hotel. the worst bit, as we arrived we got checked into a room where another guest has been checked in already - luckily he wasnt around. we called reception from the room and of course it took a long time until somebody picked up and we were able to change the room. ( we could have taken all his valuables left in room so make sure you leave your things in safe- just in case!!!) we decided to stay at marina bay sands again this june, thinking the service should have improved by now. I got disappointed again! My husband and I ordered room service breakfast- but we made the mistake not to call the evening before so we just hung out the fill out order on our door( it tells you to hang it out before 1 am - we hung it out around 11) breakfast was suppose to be delivered 7.15-7.30am. we waited ... I called up 7.35am (took me of course a long time until somebody picked up) the lady held me in line again to check and said its on its way. 8 am still no breakf. I called again ( hubby had left for work by then) and the lady told me she's afraid they didnt get my order (turns out nobody picked up my order from door) I was very upset given the price they charge for in room dining so at least I got the breakfast at 8.30am for free. I suggest you either eat outside or call up the evening before ( if you are willing to be in line for some time until somebody picks up your order) the rooms are decent size and very clean.",36

MBS,3,"“Looks Awesome, Pools is Great but that's about it”","Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a one night stopover returning to Australia from London.Arrived late in the afternoon after a long flight, were exhausted only to be greated with a 45 minute wait to check-in (didn't receive an offer of champagne) and couldn't find anyone to help with our luggage.Had to walk to the other end of the towers to get to the lift to our room (it's a long walk with multiple bags in tow and with a full lobby). Then, couldn't work out which lift we were suppose to be in (only to discover there was another check-in desk closer to our tower...but, how are you to know that before you check in?).Rooms are big, but have no personality. Toiletries are ok but for $400 or so a night I was expecting a beautiful branded toiletry. Room was clean.The pool is awesome and is really the only higlight of the hotel. The Pool Bar prices are atrocious - my husband ordered a Coke and it was $11. The shopping centre is grand but the pricing is grand to match! The food court is good though spotlessly clean and with some great options. It's not as cheap as other food courts in Singapore but for the convenience of not having to go anywhere else and when you compare prices to Australia it's fine.Breakfast was ok but have had much better in much less expensive hotels. We enjoyed our stay for the night, but I don't think I would stay at Marina Bay Sands again. I've had the experience and I'm able to say I've swam in one of the most amazing pools in the world but I wouldn't return.",92
MBS,1,“NOT RECOMMENDED !!”,"We booked our stay for 4 nights earlier this month. Wasn't a good start when we had to carry our own luggage to the room. We had to share a table with another couple for breakfast and when we asked for breakfast to be served in our room as we were checking out before the breakfast was being served, we were told that this wouldn't be a problem and have just come home to find that we have been billed SGD60.00 for two slices of toast and 2 cups of tea !!!",32

MBS,3,"“Appalling service, great location”","A friend and I stayed for one night prior to boarding a cruise and were quite looking forward to staying at this much-hyped hotel. On arrival at 10.00pm after an eight hour flight, we got to reception and had a twenty minute wait in the line and then were told that our room wouldn't be ready for two hours and could they ring me when it had finished being cleaned! My response was a very polite, but firm, no... As I quite reasonably pointed out, surely with over 2000 rooms in the hotel, there must be one room that would be available for a pre-existing booking by that hour of the night! Check-out time is 11.00am in the morning - why wasn't our room ready by 10.00pm that night? To be fair, the reception clerk was very pleasant but seemed to lack initiative in sorting out an alternative. I was surprised that I had to explain to her why a two-hour wait at that hour of the night for the room to be ready wasn't acceptable.The substitute room was very nice when we finally checked in; the Skypark is well worth a visit as the pool is really something else and there are some very nice restaurants in the complex. I wouldn't stay here again though as the reality is that the hotel really didn't match the hype and there are much better hotels in Singapore that are in this price range.",73

MBS,3,“Incredible architecture - but not a luxury hotel by any means”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in October 2010 for 6 nights while attending a week-long conference that was held at the convention center located across the street from the hotel. I, like many others, was impressed with the sheer scale of the hotel and its incredible architecture (particularly the rooftop terrace and infinity pool), but on the whole I was disappointed with the service, the level of comfort provided by the hotel, and the difficulty we had accessing basic features such as dining and casual meeting spaces.The room I had was a large, and very comfortable. I had a great bed, along with a large and comfortable seating area by the floor-to-ceiling windows looking over the Bay. The bathroom was also large and comfortable, though the shower was awkward and tended to flood the floor (no tub), and there were no outlets in the bathroom to use the hairdryer. As other reviewers have noted, there was a strong smell of sewage or waste pipes in the bathroom throughout my stay.The roof-top pool is lovely, as are the views, though I found that service was non-existent. For a hotel of this calibre and price, I would have expected pool servers who prepare your lounge chair and provide towels, and are available to serve you drinks, food, etc. There is no such service at the Marina Bay Sands, and you have to go to a small booth to get your own towel, have to sign them in and out (I guess they are afraid of theft? How tacky!) and they have a few snacks like potato chips and candy for sale. They are definitely missing out on a opportunity to make money and make guests feel more welcome without poolside service.I believe most of the hotels' problems stem from the fact that it has a HUGE number of rooms (2500 I think?) and it does not have enough dining and service facilities to accomodate all of those guests. During my stay the hotel was full to capacity, and it was impossible to have breakfast at the 2 restaurants available due to the lines of guests waiting to be seated, often for more than 1/2 hour. My colleagues and I ended up having coffee and pastries every morning at the \Sweet Spot\"" coffee shop at the base of Tower 3, which was faster and usually not crowded.Another major problem for me was the hotel's total absence of informal meeting/gathering spaces. The design seems to have been completely focused on the architectural drama of the hotel...and while it's impressive, it's also austere to the extreme. The very long lobby that connects all 3 towers has got to be a quarter-mile long, and I counted 5 benches available for seating along the whole thing. Yes, FIVE. For me, a business hotel should have comfortable seating and gathering spaces in the lobby where guests can gather, have a pre-meeting before an event or dinner, without having to be seated in a restaurant or bar.Finally, due to the size of the hotel and neighboring convention center/shopping mall, everything is a long walk. It was at least a 10-minute walk to the meetings rooms each day. I will say that the food/catering and service in the convention center was excellent, and very varied each day. Because Singapore has such a mix of cultures in its population, the food offerings each day included vegetarian fare, items prepared without pork, without gluten, etc. so that a large conference with a variety of international attendees would be well served.The hotel bills itself as a luxury hotel, but I found the service subpar. It may have been due to the hotel still being quite new at the time of my visit, but in general I found that most requests took a very long time to fulfill, and that the check-in and check-out staff in particular were slow and generally not helpful. The concierge staff was OK, though one night we asked them to help us get a reservation at a casual restaurant, and we were sent to one of the most expensive Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Thank goodness for expense accounts.The next time I visit Singapore, I won't be staying here.""",259
MBS,1,"“Awful Service - come for the casino and the pool, but don't stay overnight !”","This is the 2nd time I stayed at this hotel.Nothing much has improved - although I note that the \Management\"" has taken serious note and will look into these serious matters in previous Tripadvisor posts. I suppose it was all fake lip service.When we got to the reception at 3pm, the line was (as expected) very long and slow moving. It was wonderful to watch as rude tourists jumped queue and the hotel staff did not do anything to help. It took us almost an hour to check in. Not a great start.When we got to the room, it was meant to be non-smoking but it reeked of tobacco. Not a great follow up. I notice they did not remove the timer on the fridge - remove any items for more than XX seconds and your credit card gets charged.When we went to the pool, the security kept harassing all around the place. And not to mention the bus loads of tourists snapping photos of the pool, we felt like monkeys at the zoo. Not a great experience.Check out time was 11am, and they refused to extend us a late check out. I wonder why it takes the casino so long to check people in and get the rooms ready, if they have 3-4 hours to prepare?Come for the casino. Go visit the inifinity pool and the bars. Watch the Lion King show.But don't even bother staying here for the night. Not unless you like being ripped off.Marina Bay Sands - you don't deserve to be called a hotel.""",277
MBS,3,“Great for a one night stay to experience something different”,"This place is pretty darn cool with the awesome rooftop pool. That enough is worth staying for one night and just hanging out all day on the rooftop.The location is great and the access to (way too expensive label) shopping and free shuttle from the airport is great too.The downsides: The free shuttle drops you in the carpark below the hotel so you don't get to enter the hotel through the front enterance and enjoy the glam of arriving in style. The bus driver didn't even tell us where to go so we stood in a carpark with our bags trying to decide how to get into the place. No one came to help us or take our bags. The room was a non-smoking room but it stunk of smoke. The service was average and it had all the charm of a big corporate designed to strip you of as much money as possible. We ate at the pizza place in the hotels shopping centre and were short changed $10 Singapore....but we were fairly sure it wasn't an honest mistake. We didn't go into the casino but did go to the Museum of Art and Science - paid $30 each to look around a virtually empty museum advertising a Van Gogh exhibition that had no actual paintings but just projected images of paintings (OK fun once we got over the inital disappointment). The hotel room was around NZ$450 - so the most expensive place we have ever stayed. Apart from being a fantastic once off experience, it was far too expensive for what it is.

So i waited another hour and no one come up, so i went to the front desk to ask. We was very angry at that time and the front desk staff was rude. I am very angry cause i am pregnant and had to stand on the front desk to urge. Our kids are hungry as we had not had our dinner due to waiting for the second room. In the end the Hotel Manager speak to me and provide me some discount and charges waved, however it spoilt all our holiday mood.What i want to say is that if early information is given to me i am ok with it but why wait till we keep calling then reply to us. It is really ridicious to wait for 6 hours to have room check in and no one follow up. There is no sincerely of sorry from the front desk manager and staff, is it because i am not tourtist? even when i check out the front desk manager saw me, he did not even bother to come over to speak to me till i ask some question on the bill whereby the staff cannot answer and ask him for help then he come over to me look unwillingly to serve me. He did not even say sorry about the incident or ask me if i am satisfy with the arrangement, this is really a very bad impression to me.

MBS,2,“Who gave them their 5 stars rating?”,"I was there for 1 night hotel stay + Lion King show package on 14 May 2011.While booking the package on the web, i realise that the hotel had a late check in timing at 3pm and very early check out time of 11am which i dont really understand the reason as most hotels in singapore or in other countries do not have such late check in time nor early check out time.But heck then, they wrote 3pm so i just follow the written, i arrive at the hotel lobby at 2.55pm and to my horror there was a long q to check in and which brings me to my question why the heck do you enforce such a late check in time when u cannot accomodate everyone rushing for it? Then the hotel staff start to panic and set up the chains for the q and open up more counter. To please the guest, a pathetic and 1/2 hearted attempt to serve guest free drinks when the root of problem is so obvious.In the end i check in around 3.35pm, so much for 5 stars when right from the start, they cannot even do it right. Was told by the receptionist that i was given a upgrade to a room that is bigger but not so much of a seaview but i did not really care by then, so in the end i had constructions site view room which many review has written about. Oh and there is the famous and much raved about swimming pool, sadly is just overhyped and overcrowded. Zero privacy, feel more like a public swimming pool with people visiting the sky park able to take photos and able to see through to the pool. Come check out time, i requested for late check out of 12pm, which i actually wrote on my online booking as well, but was deny as they said they were full but then comes the question, do you need 4 hours to clean the room since you only allow check at 3pm? Should there not be some flexibility since we check in late at the 1st place due to your ignorant and foolish 3pm check in time? Anyway the bright spark of this hotel was actually the show. It was great and certainly worth the watch. But if you are looking for a hotel to stay, there are many many more out in Singapore with the same price range and gives much more value and service.",305
MBS,3,“Not bad but many better options in singapore”,"Stayed at the MBS for 3 nights a week back. Was attending a conference here and hence wanted to stay at this hotel itself. The experience was not great but not as a bad as some of the other reviews :Positive :1) Absolutely wonderful Sands Sky Park. Stunning view. Great place to unwind in the evening (despite the crowd). Must visit. Staying at Tower 3 gives you direct access. This is the highlight of the hotel2) Amazing views from the city facing rooms. We stayed on the 40th floor. You can just sit and watch outside for hours3) Service I thought was quite good. There was never a significant delay despite being such a huge place. Pleasantly surprised here.4) Casino, Shopping & quality resturants all nearby.5) Limited options for vegetraiansNegatives : 1) They just cannot manage the crowd at the lobby. Checkin requires a lot of time and if you do reach the hotel before 3 PM be rest assured you will NOT get the room. They happily give you the option to upgrade. So pay more and get the room !2) For a quality 5star hotel the bathroom size was quite small and that too without tub. Just not acceptable (again you have the option to pay and upgrade) 3) The sea facing rooms have a terrible view. We were forced to stay for a night. Send them a mail in advance (could be on some help)4) Taxi's apply surcharge from here making it less affordable. Have to walk to MRT unlike other hotels5) For singapore standards is far away from most hotspots6) Many travel agents (Sing. attraction exp.) dont have pickup-drop from this hotel7) Room rates quite expensive at most times despite such huge supplySo I guess, Stay there once just to experience it and 2nd time onwards at other much better/cheaper options.Regards,Gautam",260
MBS,3,“A curiosity only”,"We stayed one night at the MBS. Singapore service can be a bit hit and miss and this place missed. I'm in the travel industry and have stayed in lots of Singapore hotels and this one is average at best.The pool is magical, but you feel like you are in a fishbowl as the tourists walk along the mezzanine taking photos. Also there is a lack of suitable change/shower areas. I started using the gym washroom as it has nicer facilities. BTW the gym is superb by hotel standards and there never seemed to be anyone in there.Check-in was painless. They brought us a juice while we waited. We were asked if we wanted smoking or non, we said non, he confirmed. The room was smoking.Room is beautiful (besides smoke smell). Large shower, auto curtains, flat TV, internet, Pod coffee maker in room - should be mandatory in all hotels (however MBS ruined it with powdered creamer - for those prices they could provide fresh milk?)Club room is worth the extra cost, breakfast, high tea, cocktails, all good. Club room wait staff sensational - friendly, attentive, chatty. Club room hosts/managers rude and arrogant - to the point of creepy.Lots of Singapore hotels have day-use areas for those of us who have to check out midday and fly that night. Not here. We were allowed to use pool area, but club access finishes on checkout.Ordered ice for the room. Never arrived.Asked for a menu poolside. Never arrived.Overall stay here once to see the amazing pool, etc.There is much nicer in Singapore.",114
MBS,3,“Not impressed”,"We booked in at 7pm and our room was not ready. For a new Hotel the matresses were already hollow backed, the pillows offered NO support, the curtains could not close completely with light from the street lighting the room.

Whats the point then?Staff at the front desk were not very friendly or helpfull. Only when we booked out, were they keen ;-( No complimentary tea or coffee made for grumpy awakening.The only attraction is the swimming pool and the view",300
MBS,1,“Great view; shame about the hotel”,"Want to be treated like an illegal immigant on check in? Want to pay extra for a Club Room and not be given access to facilities? Want your family to have to change in the wash rooms because there are no changing rooms for the pool? Welcome to the Marina Bay! This hotel has the benefit of a fabulous building in a wonderful location and is dragged down by the arrogance of the management and lack of care of staff. Snapshot: you arrive on an international flight, have to take a bus which stops for ten minutes at every terminal (no one gets on!) before having to queue forty five minutes to check in. Snapshot: you have paid extra for a Club room so you can use the lounge for pre-dinner drinks. You have to wait for an hour before you can get in. Snapshot: you want to change to swim in the fabulous roof-top pool. Bad luck, you can either return to your room or change in the wash-room (no hooks. bin full of used loo-paper. Lovely) Snapshot: you want to have the breakfast you have paid for in the lobby. You queue for twenty minutes (with crying children) Fabulously relaxing. Snapshot: you want to have a massage. Good luck, there is no spa. Snapshot: you use the Hotel's photographer for family pictures. Good luck with this, the snaps are blurred, over-exposed and over-priced. Snapshot; you try to get the bus to the airport on your return. No signs. You run around the basement with your luggage, miss the coach and take a taxi. The focus here seems to be on the high roller gamblers from Indonesia and China. Tourists are a gap-filler and are treated as such. Such a disappointment and a real blight on Singapore's tourist scene.",383
MBS,3,“Not sure!”,"My husband and I wanted to stay in this hotel as soon as we saw the website and we had seen a documentary on the Tv about the construction. I booked online through their website and decided on a club floor room. Expensive , but at the time I though why not. Our check in procedure took about 5 minutes and the staff member was very friendly and polite. I had requested a city view and she even mentioned that to me at check in and said she had given us a nice room with a nice view. So up to our room, we decided to take our own luggage thanks to reading some prevoius reveies. Our room was on the 36th floor, but when I opened the door we had a sea view, which was nice at first glance but as I moved closer to the window, all I could focus on was the construction site. Very dissapointed, but I thought I wouldn't be spending that much time in the room, so why bother to ask to be moved to another room. So off we go to explore. the 57th floor was quite amazing, the pool was devine, but very busy. I too find it strange that it is open to people not staying in the hotel to come up to the 57th floor, just takes the shine off paying so much for a room. The club lounge access to the 57th floor was quite a treat, the breakfast & canape's in the eving were delicous. We went to the chocolate buffet one evening, OMG so much chocolate, so many choices, I did feel a little sick when we left. We didn't get turn down service whilst there, even though it was included, no big deal really but why say its included, if you are not going to bother doing it. We only got a newspaper delivered on the first morning, not on the second morning. Check out was also fast and very impersonal, the staff member didn't even look me in the eye. Overall I would say that this hotel is too big and the service well there really isn't any. very dissapointed that we were so looking forward to our stay and it didn't live up to all the hype.",198
MBS,3,“Fabulous rooftop - but very impersonal hotel and crowded”,"This hotel is actually hard to rate as there are polarising aspects to it. Firstly the good:-the rooms are a large size, and well furnished and as they are only new everything is in great shape.-The rooftop pool is amazing - am sure you will have checked out all the photos-Ku de ta is a fab restaurant with quality service-Easy location, with great shopping mall and casino attachedThe bad:-the hotel is so large that service is completely lacking and impersonal. Long lines for everything - check in desk, concierge, cafes. Returned to room at 4pm every day with an unmade room and had to ring for service. The hotel has no ambience, it feels like an airport terminal. -there is no exclusivity of being a guest when the general public can come to the rooftop - yes they are in a segregated section - but it is only by a small curtain so guests are lying by the pool being gawked at by a LOT of tourists.......very odd!-restaurants/bars do not offer any priority to in-house guests so again very impersonal feelingSo overall if these things don't bother you then it is a stylish hotel and a good experience",129
MBS,1,“WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE”,"I had a prepaid reservation for 2 rooms. Arrived and reception told me that my reservation was cancelled. They made us wait till 6pm to give a room. Breakfast was a long 15 minutes queue. We had to sit at seperate tables because there is non available to sit 4. It was over crowded. All the food outlets was full so we had to celebrate our wedding anniversary dinner in the room. Upon check out I settled the bill but Marina Bay Sucks made unauthorised charges to my credit card few days later. Today 5 months later, I am still trying get my money back. Don't believeif the operator tells you that someone will call you back. They never do. I wont stay there again even if its free.",133
MBS,3,“Nice...but not sure about value for money....”,"Stayed 2 nights at an upgraded room (only because our initial room was not clean when we stepped in). Hotel is large and so is the mall - which is nice to walk. Views from the Skypark is nice. This is a hotel that caters to large crowds - i.e. you will lots of people in the lobby, at breakfast, restaurants and of course, the Skypark (pool / observation deck areas).Room is ok. Spacious and typical in design. TV channels could have been better. Bath towels were good and so was the bed (nice and comfy).Had breakfast for the two days - it was surprisingly good despite catering the masses. Only thing is to put up with the crowds.It was an ok first time stay, but not sure if it's value for money.",223
MBS,3,“Overhyped”,"I do understand everyone is talking about this rooftop pool, but the hotel itself is very very average. Basically it's a been-there-seen-that kind of experience: once you've stayed there once, had a look at the pool you will not return again for the hotel itself.The rooftop area is extremely overcrowded, as well as the lobby and everything else: it feels as an airport rather than as a hotel. You will see the pool, but you won't really enjoy it.Rooms are reasonably spacious (Horizon Grand); decoration is very bland - feels as another faceless business hotel; beds are good; uncomfortable shower controls with insufficient water pressure. Try to get a room with a balcony.Beware: if you have turned on the privacy light, that does not mean they will not wake you up - they will not knock on the door, but they will give you a phone call. Stupidity beyond understanding.Overall this airport experience, as well as queues at the reception do not fit the concept of a 5-star hotel.All hotel attractions except for the pool are available to non-guests: you don't have to stay there to go the roof (you'll have to buy a ticket though), visit the casino or shop at the arcade.Do check out Sweet Spot cafe at the Tower 3 lobby: great sweets, way better than in most cafes around.",98
MBS,1,“Service is ridiculously bad!”,"They checked me into a second room floor, facing the highway which was super noisy. When I complained they claimed they didn't have any other rooms I could move into. I called the front desk thrice before they said they had a fifth room room available for me. But it was a smoking room when I specifically registered for a non smoking one. After my trip, they charged me for my room when the travel agency had already paid them and now I have to deal with the hassle of asking the bank to reverse the conversion charges.",134
MBS,3,“Ridiculous check-in experience”,"For a five-star hotel, you wouldn't expect there to be an hour-long check in experience on a Saturday afternoon, but that's just what we had. Any half-wit with a hospitality degree should have figured out how to manage this hotel by now, but apparently that's not happening. My request for a pass to the sky park (so we could buy $20 cocktails while waiting for the check-in time, 3 PM, to arrive) apparently was a first and met some resistance. Apparently they prefer if you stand in line instead of spending money and enjoying yourself. MBS is a nicely located hotel with innovative architecture - and uncreative and unhelpful service. Any 3-star casino in Las Vegas would have a series of lessons to teach this place - hard to believe it's a Sands hotel.",349
MBS,1,"“Bad Experience, not worth for it!”","We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on 7 & 8 May 2011, first, we have been queued up for more than 45 mins for the check-in, the reception lady told us that the room we booked was full and they would like to offer a room upgrade to \Premium Room\"" for us, however the room view is subject to availability and they can only offer us a \""SEA VIEW\"" in Tower 1 & Tower 2. When we checked-in to the room, we found that the view is not a \""SEA VIEW\"" which is a \""CONSTRUCTION VIEW\""! I called to the related department and request to have room change, they said they were full and cannot change the room for us, the earliest they can change the room for us will be tomorrow morning at around 9am or 10am! Then, I went to the Reception counter and talk to the duty manager again, he gave me the same answer but he said it is not guarantee that they can change the room for us, it will subject to availability! I complainted that they haven't mention the room is facing the construction site, he said that is sea view not construction view and why they will not change the room for us if they have room! It was so funny, there still a lot people checking in, how come they can't reassign the room for us?? I told him that I was very disappointed andprobably will let my friens know and even send the letter to complaint about this, he replied me \""OK, no problems\""....I haven't receive any follow up regarding the room change request, they said they will call me but I haven't received any call or message! It is totally not fair to guest if some can stay in the room with city view and some can only stay in the room with construction view but all may paying the same room rate!Actually, if we pay such high room rate, we can have a better service and enjoy a better view from the room in other hotels!""",290
MBS,1,“A very disappointing experience for a supposed highly rated hotel”,"I was in teh Marina Bay for 4 nights before a cruise from Singapore and it was a very poor ocerall experience. after flying down from Hong Kong and arriving about 6pm was told that rooms maybe available in 2 to 3 hours, we had 5 roosm booked from over 4 montsh earlier, arriving early I understand but to be told that you may only be able to check in 9pm on a Saturday night was not a good start. The hotel cannot cope with the volume of people and customer service is poor. On the night before leaving the key would not work on the door and it took 3 (THREE) hours for the hotel to get us into the room as the personel to sort out door issus is outsourced ! For over 2 hours we were in the waiting with no estimated fix time coming from the hotel staff who couldn't get a response from the outsource company. I don't know how thsi policy can work for health and safety as if someone is in the room sick and door has problem they have NO way of access without the outsource company. A GOVT Health and Safety visit should be done. At the end of this the desk manager came and apologised and advised he would send mail explaining what had gone wrong with their processes, this was 4 weeks ago, I'm still waiting. The brochures are all customer experience etc, they do not live up to their marketing from a customer service and what you expect from a brand like this and to have significant safety issues is a major concern. A very differnet experience to the Venetian in Macau where they have got it right.",295
MBS,3,“Needs work”,"Off the bat, my understanding is that this is still quite a new hotel, so they're working things out. I expect things to improve in the next six months.As such, keeping this short and sweet.Anyway, on with my thoughts.Negative========Location: There's nothing really near by with buses and taxi the only access if your a tourist. Had feedback from the local taxis with the way traffice management is been handled.Service: \Touch and go\"" sums it up. Initial check in was fine however after that, thing went down hill. It came to a head when we had to make a complaint since my wife got the run around - all just to set up a premier club account. Something like that should be EASY instead she was fed all the wrong information. She wasted one hour on this and I was less then pleased.Value: The room itself was nice but for the price we paid, we could easily get comparable rooms and stayed for more nightsPositive========Facilities: Gym and Pool, great Gym and pool area.Room: The room iself was nice and spacious with a good view. Only one TV was a bit weird for a hotel of that class.Conclusion==========Hotel although great to look at, still needs work in terms of improvements in training and business processes. Checking in was fine for us but checking out was a nightmare due to the amount of guests and the lack of co-ordination of staff members. Entry should be seperated for hotel guests and general public. It's a minor security detail.ABOVE AND BEYOND: I want to thank Karen, someone from their marketing department who helped us to sort all our issues.RECOMMDATION NOTE: At this stage, I'm recommending this hotel just in terms of their facilities and rooms, their service still needs work""",360
MBS,3,“bad experience during check-in”,"On march 1, 2011 we arrived in the hotel at around 3:30 pm. One of my lady friend had already made the reservation for us days before..The lady in the registration named Chey said our name was not listed in the reservation, and that a certain Mr. Akmad was reserved instead together with our lady friend. This made us so confused, and what's worst is that she informed us that our confirmation number is useless since our name was not in there in the reservation list together with our lady friend. We contacted our lady friend( since she was not with us when we check-in) to no avail as her cellphone has an empty bat, and Chey did not try to at least make our confusion bearable, she just kept telling us \again i can't check you in coz' your names are not on the list\"".So we are forced to take a taxi and went to where our lady friend was (who was so sure of our reservation). We don't know what really happened but when we came back (around 6pm), one of Chey's co-workers informed her that there's another one of that name (almost similar name of our lady friend who also made a reservation)!!! and Chey did not even bother to say sorry for all the troubles we had. If only she did not put aside our confirmation number it would have saved us time, effort and taxi fare. At the end of our stay, we informed an employee there who claimed to be the in-charged of complaints. I do hope the staff be given proper sanction so that situation like this will never happen again. We expect our stay to be relaxing but we're so tired and disappointed with what happened. It would be good if hotel employees extend natural friendliness and sympathy to their guests. I feel discriminated that day because i noticed that the other formal attired-guests are well served. We're not able to enjoy our stay on that day, but of course the next day was so great as the infinity pool takes all our stress away. MARINA BAY SANDS, train your staff well.""",948
MBS,1,"“ZERO star service at a \Five\"" star hotel”""","I was reading the most recent posts on this website and I have to concur. This hotel is horrible (in the most horrible sense)! It was supposed to be a weekend getaway for me and my girlfriend and we were expecting to be wow-ed, but instead we were left utterly frustrated and disappointed. My first negative experience came even before I checked in! I made my reservation via the hotel's website. It wasn't until a few days later did I receive a confirmation email on my booking, and this was ONLY AFTER I sent them a follow-up email to inquire about it.The confirmation email stated that I could check-in at either Towers 1 or 3 and provided NO INFORMATION on parking for vehicles. Naturally, I drove my car to one of the towers, only to be told by hotel staff that the carpark entrance is located on the opposite side of the road where the convention centre and shops were. Hence, I had to make a detour. There were road signs indicating where the carpark was but those who do not know better will think that this carpark was only meant for people heading to the shops and convention centre. I parked my car under the section marked \Hotel\"". You would think that the elevators/escalators at the carpark would lead you up to the hotel. NO IT DOESN'T! It leads up to the shops and it took us at least another 15 minutes of walking before we got to the hotel. Next up is the check-in experience. The actual check-in process was alright - took about 10 minutes. But we had to queue for about 30 mins before we got our turn! When we first joined the queue, there was a family of tourists at the front. They were complaining about not being served despite having waited in line for one hour! I believe that check-in times are usually bottlenecked at the housekeeping and reception levels. From my experience with other 5 star hotels in Singapore, checking in at 2pm and checking out at 12pm is the norm. Marina Bay Sands' check-in and check-out times are 3pm and 11am respectively. This is already an additional 2 hours for housekeeping to ready the rooms for new guests. At reception, there were four staff serving the check-in crowd of about 5-7 groups at that time. Therefore, the only logical reason that I could think of for the appalling waiting time is lack of manpower. But then, is this a justifiable excuse? After all, guests are paying 5-star rates, and they should be getting 5-star service. Sometime later, I realised that I had forgotten to inquire about the complimentary access card for use when exiting the carpark the next day. I was checked-in at Tower 3 and had approached the reception there to make my inquiry. To my dismay, they were unable to provide me with the information that I needed and I was told to approach the valet service counter at Tower 1, which was at the other end of the building - a 5 min walk. I finally reached the valet service counter and once again made the same inquiry. Another piece of dismal news - MBS does not provide complimentary parking for its hotel guests and a fee of $6 is required. $6 is not a big amount and I can very well afford it. But what peeves me is the knowledge that MBS has the cheek to charge ITS OWN HOTEL GUESTS for parking when most other (if not all) hotels in Singapore provide complimentary access. Why are guests not informed of this beforehand? Surely MBS does not expect all its guests to be foreigners? Also, I think that my question was a very basic question which the reception staff could have handled. Telling a guest to do a 5 min walk for such a simple matter does not reflect well on the hotel's service standards at all. My experience the next day was no better. I got woken by sounds of highway traffic and construction drilling at about 9am. Just some background information before I proceed - the MBS project was a massive undertaking with the Singapore government. However, there was some delay and they had no choice but to open only certain parts of the estate to the public, the hotel being one of those opened earlier (recall that MBS is made up of several components i.e. hotel, shops, convention centre etc). There was still construction work going on at an adjacent compound that is directly linked to the hotel, hence the drilling that I heard. As for the highway traffic - the hotel is located NEXT TO a major highway, so probably at least half of the hotel occupants will have the highway as the view in their rooms. So yes - MORE sound proofing work needs to be done for these rooms!To be honest, I was glad that the check-out time for MBS is an hour earlier than the norm as I was eager to leave. Given that this hotel's rack rates are not cheap, guests ARE ENTITLED to gain access to top notch amenities and service. Regretfully, this was sorely lacking in both aspects. I recall seeing this whilst using the \""Check In\"" feature for Facebook - \""Marina Bay Sands Hotel - this place is ridiculous\"". I absolutely agree.Last but not least, a word of advice to my traveler friends - there are many quality hotels in Singapore, especially around the Marina Bay area where MBS is located. Some examples include The Ritz Carlton, The Mandarin Oriental and The Marina Mandarin (good value for money). Please make your hotel bookings there. =)""",251
MBS,3,“Amazing hotel but expensive and staff not yet fully up to speed”,"The Marina Bay Sands truly is the new landmark of Singapore and as such an amazing sight. However, with apparently more than 10,000 staff, training probably must be something that happens on the job, which might be why the service does not (yet) live up to full five star standards. There is also a lot of construction going on around the hotel, in particular towards the waterfront, and the first room that was assigned to us was on a low floor looking directly at the highway that is right in front of the hotel and the construction site beyond it. Having said this, the hotel is brandnew and the rooms are clean, come with huge TV screens, a nice bathroom with a free standing tub and all amenities that would be expected from a top notch casino hotel. Restaurants and shops are abundant and further dining and shopping options are still being added. The infinity pool at the top of the hotel is amazing and probably a good enough reason to stay at Marina Bay Sands for a night or two. To sum it up, Marina Bay Sands is definitely a must-see and worthwile a short-time stay. But (unless you are a serious gambler for which the location next to the casino is most important) for longer stays I would not recommend it as the service needs improvement and as a mega hotel/tourist attraction with no focus on treating guests according to their individual needs does not provide a \feeling-at-home\"" atmosphere.""",272
MBS,3,“Nice place but not worth the money and service needs LOT of improvement”,"We stayed in MBS with some family members. We got the rooms as part of the package. The location is great and there are busses just beside, and a 10 minute walk brings you to Suntec City/MRT (Circle line). The infinity pool on the top is worth a visit and offers breathtaking views of Singapore. We stayed for a couple of nights there and seem we started to have a tough luck on the first night (evening) itself. The room is facing a major highway (AYE) and west sun, so the room is pretty hot even though the A/C is on. Ironically the A/C temp adjustment seems not working. So after about 30 min the service staff came and ‘adjusted’ the settings. The guy keeps on mumbling and sure needs to improve his English <U+F04A>Second day we started with pretty good energy levels and we had a short visit to the infinity pool on the top. Views are breathtaking and just Google for the pics. I’d say this is the best part of the hotel. Not a lot of variety for food and food is terribly expensive. Same goes for shopping areas. The canals are pretty clean (much better than any other Venetian places) and I’d say being in Singapore this can be taken for granted.In a one line summary, the place is more for business folks rather than a casual visitor or family visit.Pros:Location and easy access to attractions Newly constructed (still in great condition) & contemporary designs. Casino just at the ground floor and 10 min drive to sentosa & resort world sentosaCons:Service needs lots of improvementNot family friendly (IMHO)Expensive",167
MBS,2,“Nice rooms but shame about the food and breakfast quality”,"Overall this is a terrific hotel for Singapore as a tourist attraction. The sky park pool is worth seeing on a clear (but preferably not a weekend) day. My main gripe is lack of 5 star service and crowded, lacklustre food options. The buffet is large enough but you may have to queue 30 minutes to get a table and once there the food is pretty inedible. Better to go into the shopping mall and buy breakfast from a Coffee Bean. When we arrived the interconnecting door for the children wasn't open (we waited 45 minutes for the key at 12:30 AM) and the sheets for the 3rd child's bed had not yet been provided (another 30 mins). But the rooms are lovely, clean and well functioning...and the view if you get the city side is wonderful at all hours. The attached shopping mall is really one of the best in the world - not quite finished yet - but lovely natural light and spacious/easy to shop.",161
MBS,1,“DON'T STAY HERE”,"We stayed in a suite on 53rd floor.the room was great, the view was amazing the shopping was impressive but the rest is \crap\"".we have just spent 4 weeks in Sth Africa staying in luxury accommodation this hotel would not rate at 1 out of 5 in comparison.we arrived after a 10 hr flight,the que was long at reception the service was appalling,we were given no advice on facilities nor were we told what Tower we would be accommodated in, they were only interested in pushing the never ending que through.it is like a jungle in the foyer.people push past you trying to fight their way to the lifts. We decided to have room service, the person delivering the food was embarrassed to inform us that they would not allow to have it charged to the room. There was no turn down service.In the past we have stayed at Raffels and St Regis,without exception they are far superior in every way..""",134
MBS,3,“Very dissapointing”,"Hotel itself is spectacular, but architecture does not substitute for service. Our bags took 3 hours to be delivered to the room. Only one of our 2 rooms available on check in. was not able to access second room until late at night. Carpet was soaking wet due to a water leak in bathroom, Hot water tap also broken leaving us to shower in other room. was kept awake from inconsiderate neighbouring guest till 2am (Poor sound insulation between rooms) Breakfast was like herding cattle. Concierge sent us to view the 9.30 sound and light show at 10.30 and 11.30PM (We obviously did not get to see it) Bags were misplaced again on check out leaving us to miss our airport transfer and having to pay for a second service. I could go on.",608
MBS,3,“Not value for money - definitely do not recommend it to others”,"I stayed at the Marina Sands Bay (Club room) for two nights 18/4/11 and 19/4/11 with the Lion Show package.In a nutshell it was a very average experience for a above average rate. There was simply NO wow or exciting factor.Check-in time (5mins) was expedient in view that it was the peak check-in window at 2:45pm. However I was given a room on a smoking floor (35th) without being consulted or informed. It's basic reception skill 101in the hospitality industry. Always inform/consult with the guest when assigning him/her a smoking room. For the reception in a 5 stars establishment like MBS not to do so is just inexcusable. A case of MBS being overbooked and hence forcing its staff to find whatever room is available for the guest?It's one of the few if not the only hotel in Singapore that have check-in and check-out times of 3:00pm and 11:am respectively. By that MBS is in fact robbing its guest of two hours from their stay to save on its housekeeping direct staffing costs. Better profitability at the guest's expense !! The atmostphere in the hotel lobby resembled that of a bazzaar with a mix of guests and general public in the crowd. A function of the 2000+ rooms capacity no doubt. To add to it Justin Bieber was there at the time and his fans were there too of course. Choatic.The room was spacious but quite ordinary and uninspiring by way of decor and ambient.For example the curtain/sheen are drawn open/close by electric motor but there is no remote for it by the bedside for the guest convenience. The magnificent view from the room is the only consolation to a very ordinary and somewhat disappointing room experience.Called \express service\"" operator to find out and confirm if my room is indeed a smoking room. Was put on hold for 3-5 minutes and then cut off. No call back from the operator. I had to call to ask again before provided with an affirmative reply after another minute hold and wait. I would have thought an immediate reply is expected of such a simple and straight forward question. Apparently \""express service\"" is not quite what it means at the MBS. Staffs whom I had contact with were generally polite and helpful. Special mention must be made of the housekeeping and Skypark Club Lounge staffs. They did try their best to make up for the many shortcomings of the establishment they work for. They were sincerely friendly and helpful.The Skypark is the only saving grace factor for MBS. Its magnificent view and relaxing Infinity pool were the only experiences living up to the marketing hype put out by MBS as far as I am concern.Access to hotel billing information through the room entertainment (tv) system together with its express check-out procedures does making it quick and convenient for its guest to depart. Certainly a positive considering I wanted to get out of such an ordinary and mediocre experience as quickly as I can.As if too aware of its many shortcoming MBS does not even provide feedback card in its room for the guest to fill in. There is not one in my room at least. I am sure their explanation for it would be the availability of their online feedback for productivity reason. My advise to travellers out there is for the money you would be spending by staying at MBS there are quite a few much better hotels in Singapore to go to instead. I could name them here but that would be quite unethical. And it may be perchieved as a review being put forth by a MBS competitor.""",204
MBS,3,“Big disappointment”,"Not many hotels in Singapore is as expensive as MBS, and you really don't get very much for the extra money spent. The rooms are as new and grand as you would expect, but they aren't cleaned daily, only dusted. We never had our room cleaned before 3 PM during our 6 days stay. Houskeeping seemed very stressed - as if the workload is way too big.The check-in area is placed in Singapore's largest corridor; very noisy and impersonal - even though the staff is doing the best they can. Sky Park is ok until the early afternoon when the kids take over the place. The pool has no deep end, so there is no place for adults, really.MBS has no natural neighbourhood. There is no convenience store, farmacy or ice cream stall just outside. But if you are in need of a diamond or a Rolex you have plenty to choose from.Internet connection was charged SGD 15 for aone hour, SGD 190 for 6 days. On the other hand: outside Tower 1 there is an abundance of taxis, and the chinese couple getting a taxi for you are friendly and charming. They were the only ones to recognise us from day to day.",282
MBS,3,“Nice room and great pool but not set up to operate at high occupancy”,"Booked 2 rooms on 23rd Apr. Registered at 3pm and had to wait till 4.30pm to get a room. Got the other room only at 6pm ! What pissed me off is not waiting for the room to be ready, after all it is the Easter long weekend and they are running full. When at the registration counter, you can hear them saying \your room will only be ready in an hour or so\"" to practically every guest. Back to the part that pissed me off. I indicated I need 2 baby cots for my pair of twins (<2yrs) during reservation, when registering they told me yes we have baby cots for you but your rooms are not ready. Fine, I will wait for the rooms, and lo and behold, the baby cots are still not available when I got the 2nd room. I called them so many times, got transferred a few times, and finally got a \""you are on the waiting list for baby cots\"" And they have the cheek to say that you will probably got the baby cot tomorrow when I pressed them on the chances of getting it while on waiting list ! That was already 9pm then. I requested to check out immediately and demand a full refund, since I'm not going to have a good night with 2 babies in tow without baby cot. They said I can't get a refund but they will get housekeeping to look for baby cot again. Finally, 30 mins later, they delivered one to my room, and said that's the last one they have. Had to sleep with my wife and one kid on the bed through the night.""",282
MBS,3,“Not Recommended For Travelling with Children”,"We could not figure if we walked into a hotel, a train station or a tourist attraction. We were prepared for crowds but not to this extent that there's invasion of privacy, from the entrance of the hotel right up to the lift landing of the floor we were staying.The quality of the room is simple, basic and sufficient for one not intending to stay in the room for long duration (get into activities like gambling, poolside, shopping, etc). There's absolutely no service in the room, no turn-down, nothing except the once a day cleaning.However, if you do need require extra service, all you need to do is call and be patient. The service staff will attend to you eventually. Do not expect more or you'll be disappointed.Definitely a wide offerings of restaurants but be prepared to fight for a place or advance reservation highly recommended. We were perpetually in queues. Out of this world roof top swimming pool, which is the biggest issue, as the hotel charges visitors wanting to view the pool. So, here we are in our swim suits, tanning and a whole load of tourists snapping pictures away and sitting by our lounger to pose for pictures! Absolutely no privacy. There is no designated lift for tourists, separated from guests, so you'll be in your robe amongst tourists and restaurants guests! There is no security at all! It is a partial business hotel since being located in the Central Business location, however, internet access in room is S$15+++ per hour!These all, there is no place for children. If you are a young couple and doesn't care about privacy and noise, this is a happening hotel suitable for you.",468
MBS,1,“Do not stay here”,"I often travel to Singapore for business and have been very pleased with the quality of hotels. This only compounds the disappointment we experienced when trying out the Marina Bay Sands. My wife and I decided to spend a long Easter weekend with friends there, we chose this hotel as it has received a lot of publicity since opening for it's facilities.It started a week before our trip when we attempted to make a reservation for dinner at their restaurant, Coup de Ta. After several phone calls that inevitably ended with \ we will email you a confirmation\"" (that never came) we were finally able to get through to the reservation manager the day before arrival, only to be told \""we are full-as we are very popular, you should have booked a week ago\"".Sadly, that is minor compared to arriving at 1:00 am to be told that the hotel was overbooked and the rooms we had confirmed 2 months previously weren't available. After a 30 minute wait we were given 2 \""suites\"" that had only a single pulldown bed in each room (when was the last time you saw a Pullman bed in a hotel? A first for me). When I called to point out that I still didn't have a bed for one of my two children, they suggested she sleep on the floor, as they had no spare beds and wouldn't have any for the weekend. I was assured that a manager would call me in the morning to sort out new rooms.After a sleepless night due to the combination of a highway running past the non soundproof balcony doors, loud third rate air-conditioning, and an amazingly uncomfortable small bed shared by me and my wife (having never slept on a pulldown bed, maybe it's actually a comfortable one-hope never to have a basis for comparison), I never re dived a call from a manager. It took 4 calls to contact somebody with any inclination to sort the problem out-and they just told me to check back with them at 6:00 pm, as \""something should clear up by then\"".In the meantime, I enjoyed one of the worst room service breakfasts ever. My boiled eggs were literally almost raw-when cracked open poured over the p,ate making it all inedible. An hour later I got a new breakfast, but it had clearly sat somewhere for 30 minutes, and was stone cold.The much publicized pool is stunning, but forget about service.After2 trips to the front desk, finally got two rooms that vaguely fit what had been confirmed.As I occasionally go to Vegas,I should have been pleased...the decor is just like Las Vegas...unfortunately it is Vegas in the 70's...brown and mustard synthetic fabrics that you want to keep flames away from.The worst hotel service and experience I've had in Asia.""",352
MBS,2,“Will Not Return”,"MBS was just opened in April with lots of fanfare so my family with my parents decided to experience the hotel for New Year Celebrations. We stayed from the 28th till the 3rd. What began with high enthusiasm and expectations soon met with equally high disappointment all around from the very first day. The check in process was extremely slow and I am from Indonesia which should be used to agonizing delays. We checked in around 3 PM and still can not get our room till 6 PM and they gave terrible news that they can't give us a room facing the marina and the NY fireworks. The hotel was crowded and filled with people trying to get to the top floor, so it takes a while to get our bags up. The next morning we were again shocked at the lines to get our breakfasts, we had to wait 45 minutes to get seated or have to walk 1 mile to get to another breakfast area near the convention centre. This happened every morning and made you regret taking a room with breakfast when we could just go down to the food court for better and cheaper meals. The staff was friendly until i missed a tip and they started singing my room number outloud in the corridor going away, which was unthinkable if you stayed in Korea or Japan or Indonesia. We also had trouble sleeping because the room is not sound proof from the neighbors so at 1 AM we still heard people talking and laughing. Location was not very good and it is quite a walk from Marina area except at night which is cool. The price was too high for this type of room in this area. Mandarin Orchard is a bit cheaper but so much better. I even preferred Concorde which is way cheaper or Fullerton. We also didn't enjoy the infinity pool with so many people walking around and watching and so much wind up there. The only good thing is they missed charging us for extra beds but i will not apologize for it.",178
MBS,1,“Nice but just useless billing and check-in system”,"We travelled to Singapore in March 2011. Stayed in the Atrium Room with two boyys 9 & 6 for one night after a four wait to be allocated a room. Here there was a sofa bed the size of a King Bed, enough for the four of us. We proceeded for a cruise for three nights and back to Marina Bay for four nights. Guess what? They did not have any rooms. After another 3 hours of haggling, they finally got a free upgrade to the Horizon Room, slightly larger. The sofa bed was enough only for 1. So an hour and a half later we got the extra bed. So much for an upgrade.Upon checkout, I was told that if I pay by cash, the amount charged to my Visa card upon check in as deposit would be reversed. A full SGD 500/ still remains to be reversed from my card. They are now refusing to reply to any of my e-mails.All I can say is go to this hotel if you have money to throw away.",181
MBS,1,“Breathtaking View and Worst Stay Ever”,"We had the privilege to stay in the Marina Bay Sands during a business trip. The hotel is beautiful, view is breathtaking and that is pretty much where it stops for us.It took 2 1/2h to check in and there were only 4 other guests doing the same. Our room was nice, but not exceptional. The service in the hotel was the worst we've ever experienced. The majority of the staff can't speak English and they're not trained.With a \do not disturb\"" light on, the housekeeping staff just opened the door and entered, while we were getting dressed; not a knock on the door, no warning. It happened twice in as many days.There was only one waitress serving in the restaurant and 30 min after ordering coffee, we gave it up. When asking the other staff in the restaurant they either can't speak English or respond with \""I am not a waiter.\""This hotel was truly our worst stay ever and we've not heard a single positive thought from anyone who stayed there, our friends in Singapore or people in the industry.""",420
MBS,1,“Save your money”,"My husband, 5 year old son and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands in March, for my birthday. We are regulars to Singapore, and visit every second month or so, and we often stay in wonderful hotels. This was meant to be a big treat, paying $440 USD for one night. The location was not as good as many other hotels. The foyer was like an airport. No ambiance, nowhere to sit or relax. Big glass sliding doors opened into a huge empty hall. With many people rushing around. There were just 2 staff at check in, unhelpfully labeled Registration. We wondered if we were in the wrong queue, but the queue on the other side of the huge hall was 5 times longer, so we waited. And waited. And waited. Nowhere to sit. Most hotels have a welcoming foyer with couches and armchairs. Not even a plastic chair in this hotel. So the 3 of us stood and listened to the other guests complaining about waiting 20 minutes just to check in. The room was quite nice, but the drilling from the construction site next door was not. Very loud-and we were on the 26th floor! So we did not bother going on the baloney at all. Pool was nice after walking a very long way to the toilets that were rather awful. Staff were banging on the toilet door as I was changing, maybe they wanted to clean it, I don't know. Quite rude whatever they wanted. Because of a storm everyone was ordered out of the pool so that was the end of that. A 10 minute dip. The shopping mall was rather depressing, designer shops with not a customer in sight and lonely storekeepers standing outside, watching you and hoping you'll come in. Not my idea of fun shopping. We were not sure if breakfast was included in our $440, so we went down the next morning anyway. My son's hot chocolate never arrived, I had 1 yogurt and one croissant, my husband had a plate of hot food, and the breakfast bill came to $90 SD!! Luckily, we were able to see this weekend as an adventure and not to let this hotel's poor performance spoil our visit to Singapore. Total bill for one night : around $530 USD. We have found MUCH better hotels in Singapore for a fraction of the price, much better service and more beautiful surrounds. We won't be back. My advice would be look at the other hotels in Singapore.",191
MBS,3,“Skypark and pool worth the visit for one stay”,"The hotel was busy and I did not get the room I wanted. Although I was told by the reception that the room would be a non-smoking with a king bed, it was in fact a smoking room with two queen beds. As I was staying only for one night, I did not bother. I switched on the air con and fan to high and after a whie, the smell became less obvious. The carpet and sitting chair have stains on them and the room looks a bit bare. I checked the restaurants and found them to be expensive. The shopping mall was new and clean, not very busy. There is a food court by the skating ring with a variety of foods. Those are of better value. The best part would be the skypark at the top and the infinity pool. I spent time there in the afternoon I arrived, evening and the morning I departed and took many many great pictures of Singapore city skyline. This is the best part is you are into taking photos. In general, if you have not been there, it is worth one stay.",903
MBS,2,“What a massive disappointment and a waste of money...”,"We booked a Luxe package which was SG$1000 for a night in an Orchid Suite, all I can say is that it was a massive let down. We did write and complain about our experience to the hotel, I had to follow this up twice by phone and a second email before I got a response. The hotel wrote to us and acknowledged the majority of our complaints had been brought up by other guests - proves even with all that money to spend they can get it so very wrong....As 'compensation' for not really delivering on what a SG$1000 dollar experience should be we got a complimentary certificate for 2 at Rise Restaurant, which we will not be using as we have been told the Rise experience a bun fight!In short the hotel needs to make up its mind if its catering for the general public or for its guests, currently it is doing neither well.Rather than retyping everything out, below is the letter I wrote to Marina Bay Sands, I am afraid I went into one when writing and apologies for the length but for SG$1000 a night I expect perfection.Online BookingI booked a Luxe package online. The booking confirmation did not indicate a Luxe package had been booked. I had to ring to confirm I had a Luxe package. The booking confirmation did not indicate there was VIP checkin available nor what Tower I would need to check in at. I was not told this information when I confirmed the booking over the phone.Check inWe chose to arrive via MRT, signage was poor with a bus stop for Marina Bay Sands pointing to the right on exiting the MRT station, we never came across the bus stop and saw no more signage to the Marina Bay Sands. Signage to the hotel was too discreet, hidden by building work hoardings or non existent from the moment we entered the Marina Bay Sands complex.Once we came up into the hotel in tower two there was no signage indicating which direction check in was, we ended up finding check out, only to be told check in was all the way down at the front of the hotel in tower one (once again this could be simply resolved by providing the information in the booking confirmation) . Having checked in, we then had to go to the VIP lounge, where we were told we could have checked in. Again, why is this information not included when you make the booking and why isn't the VIP lounge signed?RoomThe room we were given looked nothing like the room in the photos, whilst the room was large in size it felt like it was an after thought to make it into a suite - like 2 regular rooms had had a couple of doors built into the interconnecting wall. It felt as if there was absolutely no consideration to the interior design of the room, either in aesthetic or use, the room contained the basic furniture that was needed in a room without any thought to the rooms shape or size.The room was sparsely furnished in comparison to its size; with a room of that shape effort needs to be made to furnish it so it does not feel like you are sat in a corridor. Why the view from the window has not been made the hero of the room I don't understand, you could have had the lounge there or added additional chairs so you could sit in the window and appreciate the view.The room was advertised as having a pillow menu, where was that menu, we never came across it.The room was advertised as having a nightly turn down service, that didn't happen either.If your going to have electric controlled curtains, have the controls next to the bed, not next to the curtains?!I tried to increase the air conditioning from its set 23 degrees to 25 degrees using the thermostat on the wall this didn't happen and for our stay the temperature remained at 23 degrees, which is freezing.ServiceI would expect a 5* hotel to have sufficient English speaking staff, be that whether its in an English speaking country or not. There is a big lack of English speaking staff at this hotel, our restaurant booking was taken for the wrong night, we were met with blank expressions when asking questions and and our food order was not correct once brought to the table - If you were in China you could let it go, but Singapore's main language is English.BathroomThe temperature control on the shower was too stiff and meant that the water had to be on full power to easily adjust the water temperature, which meant that you were covered in either scalding or freezing water before you could get to the dial to change it.There was only one bathmat next to the bath, not one for the shower.There is no towel rail, where are you supposed to put your wet towels after you have used them?SkyparkThis was like being on Orchard Road. For the money, we would have expected some privacy/exclusivity, we certainly didn't feel this was delivered during our stay. If anything using the pool felt like we were exhibits for the Sky Park day visitors. I was under the impression that the use of the pool was exclusively for guests, there were plenty of non guests using the pool.",91
MBS,3,“Good hotel - average service for price”,"Stayed for 2 nights. Hotel is large and impersonal. Lots of tourists and people checking in and out. Check-in could have been better. Asked specifically for non-smoking room and they gave a smoking room. They upgraded me to a non-smoking room. Very good sized room - large king bed, large bathroom - very nice.Service was non-existent. This is a busy business hotel rather than somewhere a family would want to stay. For the price paid, additional personalised service would be appreciated. But given the size of the hotel, this is unlikely.",399
MBS,2,"“So much hype , little substance”","We just came back from our two-night stay at MBS today. While the hotel has spectacular design and breathtaking view of Marina Bay from its sky pool, the service was a serious let down. This hotel has 2557 rooms but don't seem to have enough staffs ? On day one, we asked for a shaving kit to be delivered to our room , took them 30 minutes and two follow up calls until the kit was delivered , wonder why.The sky pool has a great view but it's always busy. Again, one sky pool has to accommodate for 2557 rooms ,so i'm sure you can imagine how busy it can be. I would have given \average\"" or \""decent\"" rating if it wasn't because of the priority express staff communicating the wrong information about car parking for hotel guests.This hotel doesn't provide complimentary parking for its guests ( unless if you're their Piaza members ). So, we parked our car in the shopping mall and had to walk about 10 minutes to the hotel. Okay, we were fine with this at first, no complaints. On the night before we checked out, we came back to to the hotel around 11pm and parked our car . Upon returning to our room, I called up the Priority Express hotline and asked specifically if i needed to inform the hotel my car plate number so that we needed only to pay $6 flat per entry rate . The lady confidently informed us that no such registration process was required and we were assured by her that upon exiting, ONLY $6 flat rate will be charged.The following day, we checked out and when were about to exit the car park, we were shocked to find out that hourly rates were charged to our cashcard!! Later did we find out that we had to inform the hotel out car plate number and they would enter the number into the system and issue us a special parking ticket. Was this communicated by the lady from Priority Express? No!! Im not making a huge fuss about the parking fee that we had to pay when exited, it was the misleading information that upset me. I hope someone from MBS Hotel operations team reads this and ensures that each guest who drives to the hotel receives an accurate information on how the parking fee has to be settled.""",378
MBS,3,"“Not quite there yet, let the hotel mature a couple of years and it might be great”","Room We stayed in a horizon deluxe room on the 46/F. It was a good 4 star room, spacious with comfortable beds and chaise but feels more functional rather than luxurious. The room lacks the character and elegance found in other Sands hotels. In fact the bench at the foot of the bed had a glue/wax stain (and evidence of unsuccessful efforts at removal); rather disappointing considering this hotel just opened recently. Our view was of the harbour and the undeveloped promenade area. Should be spectacular in the future but lacks luster at the moment. Facilities - Underwhelming lobby with bizarre colourful reception area for a 5star hotel, this is probably temporary but as first impressions last, this sets the stage for a less than glamourous experience and what to expect during your stay. Fantastic pool at night and early morning when you have it for yourself, easily the best and most impressive pool we've seen but during the day it's like a human zoo. The hotel is already beginning to show signs of wear, with peeling signs and scratches in the window. This is probably a teething problem.Service - Friendly, warm and accommodating staff. Food - Daily breakfast buffet offered a wide range of cuisine but the taste was just okay. We dont think it's worth SGD38 (although included in the room). The Chocolate Bar we found to be average bordering on poor. The display looked quite appealing but the quality and taste of the desserts were not memorable.Food court was a reasonable option but the next day, our local guests and us all had tummy trouble. Considering this is a 5 star hotel and it is Singapore, this was a bit of a shock.Location - Great location at Marina Bay, and would be even better once the MTR is up and running. Evening river walk to Clark Quay was quite pleasant. Price/Value: The scene and price are set for a 5-star experience but at present the Marina Bay Sands struggles to provide more than a 3.5 star experience. At present we do not recommend staying in MBS, instead giving them a few years to stabilize their operations and allow the surrounding area to develop. It has the potential to be great, it's just not there yet.",52
MBS,2,“2 bad security”,"No doubt its a Wonderful hotel with excellent venue but your security officer doesn't helpful and so arrogant. Both of them doesn't have full information and even they laugh back at you, i am so pissed off and its really spoiled my trip there.Luckily the incident happened on my last day there.",236
MBS,2,"“Nice hotel, horrific service”","So the hotel is new and very nice but it's not run well at all. From small things like not making restaurant reservations when they say they did (imagine showing up with a starving toddler to be told there is no reservation), to it taking over an hour to get room service and cold food being delivered, to having a confirmation for two rooms next door to each other and a baby cot to being told that that they can't do that and it taking over an hour to check in, to big problems like the lock being broken on the door to my son's room at nap time and the cleaning lady saying she reported it 3 hours before! So we had a day where we went to lunch to find we had no reservation and got back for the nap to find we were locked out of our room while my son screamed and cried for over an hour in the hallway while the staff did exactly nothing to get the lock fixed. The scene isn't even that good. It's completely dull on the roof despite having created something nicer than Shoreditch club in London. There is zero vibe and seriously no reason to stay here unless you enjoy being frustrated. Our friend from London also happened to be stayingbhere at the same time as us and they screwed up his reservation as well!",152
MBS,3,“Just one night to see the pool”,"We stayed one night at this hotel just to experience the pool on the roof and the pool was great experience.The over-all service is more like you normally find with 2-star hotels, while the price is above many 5-star hotels in Singapore. We have booked horizon delux room on top floors to enjoy the views, but when we arrived at 8pm we were offered \free upgrade\"" - the room on the 8th floor. After refusing to take this we were offered to wait for an hour for they to prepare our room on floor 42, they promised to call us when the room is ready, but nobody actually bothered to do this. So we filally checked in only at 11pm, the pool was already closed. Next morning we got an access to the pool; pool was great (except very slow service in the pool cafe and no tissue in the pool toilet:)).""",42
MBS,3,“Not worth the money”,Service is extremely slow in the club and in the room.Extremely packed with people even at the club. Swimming pool is small and filled with people. No exclusivity at all if you are thinking you will get one as a suite guest.,844
MBS,3,“No wonder there are so many mixed reviews...and here's yet another ;-)”,"I was quite worried in booking the Marina Bay Sands. For a hotel who charges this much I wonder why they are ranked this low on Tripadvisor. Certainly people who have in the past stayed here felt shortchanged or something because there was a good number who left the hotel unhappy about their stay. So I decided to just book a night and move to the Grand Hyatt where I would normally stay when in Singapore.Date of Stay: March 31,2011Room Type: Marina Bay Club Room<U+2028>Upgrade: none<U+2028><U+2028><U+2028><U+2028>Amount Paid Per Night: 432.65++SGDReservation Method: Hotel Website<U+2028>Loyalty Card: None<U+2028><U+2028>Airport/Hotel Transfer: When traveling into Singapore I usually just take a cab to the hotel either the normal cab or the limousine service at the airport, basically the difference is not that big so if you don't want to queue for your turn just head for the limousine counter and you will be on your way in less than 5 minutes. The hotel also offers shuttles to the hotel for arriving passenger but I didn't bother locating where the pickup point was. <U+2028>Check in: I've read dozens of people complaining about the 3pm check-in time and that most of them were turned away if they arrived early. I was worried this would happen but was pleasantly surprised when Didith at the counter sent me to the The Club at Marina Bay Sands for some refreshment while they clean up the room. There I was served breakfast and refreshments and in under an hour Anthony approached me with my room keys. Room: The room could be considered a suite by its size but I would have preferred that the bed was moved closer to the widows and the sitting area moved to where the bed was. To be very honest I am not least bit impressed with the room. I feel that the hotel in their rush to open didn't put some thinking in the design of the room and hence you are given a plain box with a bed, sofa, a work table and a TV. For example:1. I was on the 49th floor and had an amazing view of the Singapore skyline. I would stay again if just for the view but the automatic curtains even when fully open still covers almost 1/2 of the window hence wasting the magnificent view. If they thought about it, they could have either extended the railings of the curtains to extend to the walls on the side so that when opened it would just move off to the walls instead of blocking the view or like in most hotels which boasts their views they could just have a roll up shade instead. 2. The Nespresso Machine and electric kettle is kept inside the cabinet without any power outlets. So if you want to have coffee, you would have to bring it out and plug it elsewhere to enjoy their morning brew. In all hotels i've stayed in that have Nespresso or other coffee machines, all of them have it mounted and plugged into the sockets already and there is enough space in a room for a small cabinet to fit these in and not just appear like an after though. 3. Another example is the position of the TV, Although it should be in full view from the bed, you would have a hard time seeing the TV from the sitting area. Bathroom: Pretty standard, quite big but then not impressed one bit. The shower stall was the biggest I've been in, problem is they only equipped it with a normal shower head they least they could have done is install a rain shower system overhead. The one at the Grand Hyatt maybe half the size but at least it has one. For the amount guests are paying for I would have expected better toiletries. I understand that Paiza is an exclusive club for high rollers but they could have just picked up L'Occitane, Bulgari, Acqua di Parma or Molton Brown toiletries at least they would smell better. To be honest the Paiza Toiletries reminds me of toiletries provided in local hotels in China. Breakfast: The spread at the Club lounge is okay. Don't expect too much, at least they have eggs, sausages, hash brown, a few dimsum and congee. They have a good selection of bread, fruits and yogurt. <U+2028><U+2028>Check-out: When I got to the ground floor the Club reception desk was empty and I had to wait for over 10 minutes, after which I decided to go into the VIP lounger where I found a hotel staff to help me. Overall: Stay for the pool, get a picture taken and check out as soon as you can. Although I've read a lot of complaints about the service at the hotel, I've never encountered any except perhaps the lack of a turn down service. I've read somewhere that you have to actually request it and they won't really do it for you as part of the stay which I thought was weird because it's pretty much expected in all luxury hotels.",66
MBS,3,“good enough for experience”,"so many people in the hotel lobby and sky park. on the first day we did not use the pool coz of too many people. went there instead at 8 in the morning - but water was still cold.will we go back? maybe in the far future. and when there is discount (like this one). but at normal rate, i will not go back. too expensive.",369
MBS,3,"“Polite service staff, but disappointed overall”","We were visiting relatives in Singapore and decided to treat ourselves for a night's stay at MBS as we've recently gotten married. It was meant to be a stopover honeymoon treat for us. We booked throught the MBS website, which is more of a glossy sales brocure than useful website for information. I had to email them to ask for their booking/cancellation procedures. Entering my details I could only choose only from US states, eventhough I picked \Australia\"" for country.Prices on the website didn't include the extra tax/service charge, which only got added on *after* I've submitted my credit card details and confirm the booking. That was a substantial ~$80 added on from advertised prices. So, inital impressions weren't that good.Checking in-: long queues, very polite stuff who tried to help manage the queues but there was little they could do. Kids screaming and running about in the lobby. It was peak period after all.Rooms - we wanted some backgound music - there was no radio, not even via the TV. When we called reception to enquire, we were told we could hire a DVD player for $100 a night and that could play CDs. So we had to reply on our iphones for music for our $500/night room. Room size was good, bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large. The tub was good sized but to fit 2 in, the fixed tap in one corner could really take someone's eye out. The view of the city always impresses, but it wasn't as high as floor as I had expected or paid for. (31st floor).Upstairs the skydeck was breathtaking, but again, lots of screaming kids running about. And unfortunalty, it rained for us.All the service staff we've encountered were very polite and tried to be helpful. We appreciated that and that all of them spoke good English. Room service breakfast was good - one of the best ommelette I've ever had. Not trying to be scarastic here. It was good. So, unless it is off peak season and you've got a good discounted room rate and you are ensured of sunshine and good wearther, don't bother. Just pay $20 to go up to the Skypark for the view.""",461
MBS,3,“Spectacular but Flawed”,"The Sands is spectacular. The infinity pool, the decor all around the place. Cocktails on the roof bar overlooking the city is a very special experience (well, more on that in a minute). The rooms are big and very nice, a decent value for the upper $300's US, but not a bargain. I'll skip to the issues.The service is NOT good. We ordered food at FUSE bar one night at 11:15 pm and the waitress said \I'll have to check if we can do that. The kitchen closes at midnight\"" Wait...what?? She refused to recant this assertion and then rudely corrected my friends pronunciation of lychee. Which by the way can be pronounced both ways, depending what language you speak. Regardless, how rude! The service all around is stubborn and slow, although often polite and stubborn and slow. Fitness Center-service is very nice and view is spectacular. However, this is where the architectural marvels start to give out. The air con is in the MIDDLE of the room, and the cardio machines at the perimeter. Considering the large windows, it's pretty hot and humid and uncomfortable unless you are an accustomed Singaporean I guess. The women's locker room contains the SAUNA and basically IS a sauna. So after your sticky hot workout, you can shower off and try to change...yeah right! It's so hot in there it's a nightmare. The bathroom doors have a one way weatherstripping that swing through and trap the door on the wrong side...bad, bad, bad. The equipment is nice.Rooftop dining/drinking- Spectacular view, really world class. Also, the most expensive drinks in the GALAXY I'm pretty sure and I've been to some pretty overpriced locales. $15US for a BEER. $30 or so for a glass of wine/champagne. And get this. They don't even fill the glass!!! They put it 2/3rds and when you protest, they make it 3/4s full. A half pour for $30! It's like nothing I've ever seen. Every time! I went to the Sky on 57 to try to get happy hour snacks/drink. Same game with the half pour. And really nothin but fried crap on the menu, same as the pool, same as FUSE. Really?? Not even a satay or something? Actually, the satay at 'Rise' was fried to hell. Nightmare. So at Sky, we got those styrofoam asian crackers and ordered some grilled mushrooms which, after 40 minutes, still never came out! The stubborn slow polite waiter protested when, after 2 $30 half glasses of wine, we decided to call it a day, that we should keep waiting. Oh my word. So, go, enjoy, the view is great. But I'd stay at the FULLERTON I think. I hear the rooms there are small. But the food and location are beautiful and amazing.""",1066
MBS,3,“Dissapointed but not surprised”,"Decided to book a 3 night weekend and stay at MBS. Upon arrival at 430pm on a Friday afternoon we had to line up to check in. There were many staff on-hand at the counter and the waiting time was minimal. The ambiance of the lobby was not good. I felt like I was in a train station or in the middle of a shopping mall. The check-in area should be a bit more exclusive and perhaps a carpeted area with some soft couches or sofas to segregate it from the main hall. We were happy to know that we had been upgraded. We did not ask for this but felt we were off to a great start. The young lady checking us in was pleasant and took the time to write everything down on our key card envelope as to where the pool, gym and Marina Bay Club were located. She indicated that we could avail of the Marina Bay Club but breakfast would not be included and we would need to pay for drinks. In my opinion - if you upgrade someone, it should not come with conditions. However, we were happy to have a nice room with a better view. The room was in Tower 2 and had an amazing view of Marina Bay. This is what you are paying for - and it is spectacular. After unpacking we headed up to the pool to take a look. Amazing to say the least. However, this is where things started to slide. There are far too many people from the public viewing area lurking around taking pictures and posing. The pool area ( adults only section) is right near Ku De Ta and the public view area. The public should not be able to access anywhere near the pool area at all. There was a rope across the entry to the adult area that said \Hotel Guests Only\"" - but many \""would be\"" photographers managed to slip passed without security confirming if they were hotel guests or not . There were some billowy \""curtains\"" which were placed along the back end of the \""adult\"" only section. But the general public would constantly stick their arms through with their cameras to take pictures. It was very irritating to constantly watch people pose and act like they were movie stars or something. It was very difficult to truly relax when having to always hear cameras clicking and the constant \""oohs and ahhhs\"". The public area is fantastic in itself and would provide an adequate viewing experience without allowing entry to the one end of the pool area. MBS - you need to do something about this.Just before sunset we decided to go into the Marina Bay Club for a drink. We were stopped at the door while they checked our room number and name. We were abruptly told that we had a \""free\"" upgrade but no benefits. I explained that we wanted to have a drink and were quite willing to pay for it. I was told If we wanted to access the Marina Bay Club we would need a letter of invite from the front desk 57 floors below. Embarrassed ( there were others in the line behind me), I gave in and walked away. Felt a bit like a fool trying to get something for free.We then walked over to Skypark 57 for a drink. We asked the security personnel standing outside the restaurant if there was a bar inside where we could have a drink? She thought I said \""spa\"" and tried to direct me elsewhere. Eventually when I finally got through to her that we were looking for a place to have a drink only, she said she \""had no idea\"" but to \""check inside\"". We went to the entrance but were told we needed to be wearing long pants to enter. No problem, we though we would just nip back to the room and change. On our way back to the bar we bumped into other hotel residents in the lift , bare chested and wearing bathing suits but no shoes , obviously just having had come out of the pool. Why are guests permitted to walk around like that? hey would have had to walk past security before getting into the lift? Finally, we managed to get into Skypark 57 for the long awaited drink. We were given a menu which indicated on the bottom a minimum charge during \""happy hour\"". When we asked the waiter about \""happy hour\"" he said they don't have it. When we questioned the menu and the reference to \""Happy Hour\"", he just seem very \""blurr\"".. We ordered two drinks which came quite quickly and we settled down to enjoy the view. After about half an hour we were ready for a second drink. The waiter could not be found anywhere. The service on the outside area was poor and no one seemed to care that there were paying guests outside. Eventually we stopped one of the staff who looked like a manager and arranged another round of drinks. They appeared to be \""on the house\"" as they were not added to our final bill. We decided to go out for dinner away from the hotel , by this time we were beginning to feel a bit irritated at the poor service overall. When we went to the taxi stand, there was no line for hotel guests. It was like leaving the shopping mall. Eventually we were shepherded into a waiting black taxi. We only discovered after he pulled out that this was a premium car and we would have to pay more than double the normal taxi fee. The hotel staff never mentioned this when they waved the cab over for us. Yet another unpleasant surprise. At dinner we decided that we would check out of MBS first think in the morning an move to another hotel. We ended up at Ritz Carlton. Better rate, much better service and we left feeling genuinely appreciated. MBS is a must if you want to check out the pool and the view. I recommend you stay at another hotel nearby (Ritz Carlton is excellent) and pay the 20.00 fee to view the public area of MBS. If you are lucky you might be able to slip past the rope and take a few poses by the pool.""",296
MBS,2,“Definitley would NOT stay again.. Big disappointment”,"My girl and I spent our last three nights of our vacation in Singapore. Let's just say we had high expectations on what the hotel was going to be like.. The lobby is far from spectacular. feels like your in an airport or a big hospital... Not even a covered drop off zone, when you get dropped at the main entrance you get soaked when its raining (Which it does a lot of in Singapore) We were expecting similar to the big Las Vegas hotels.. NO comparison. The Check in was very unprofessional and unlike 5 star. We requested and paid for the higher up rooms, we received a room on the 22 floor ( Keep in mind there are 55 floors), the snooty receptionist said the Atrium rooms start on the 21st floor.. Whatever. The Sky Park and pool are something to see, the views are great and they only allow hotel guest which keep the traffic to a minimum, although still busy. The pool was FREEZING, we only got in to get a quick picture and get out! The location is not the greatest if you want to walk, you have to get a cab as the MRT train is not completed yet. Good luck getting a cab in the evening or especially on weekends! We waited in the taxi queue for 50 minutes to get a cab!!! This is cause everyone coming to the hotel or casino has to cab.. Frustrating.I could go on and on but in a nut shell we will never go back. The hotel cannot seem to manage the capacity of the hotel and service severely lacks! For the price we paid ($385 USD night) You just expect certain qualities. I will stay at the RITZ CARLTON next time!",52
MBS,3,"“Best Views , Best Pool - thats about it”",Got to agree with a previous review - this hotel is soulless and does lack character.No doubt the view and the pool are absolutley spectacular - but thats what you pay for.Mixed service - really good check in and bell service.Extremley bad service at the renowned Chocolate buffett on Level 57 .,923
MBS,2,“Epitome of over promising and under delivering.”,"Stayed here with my partner for 1 night and it was a special occasion for us. Check-in time is at 3 pm and we arrived there slightly after 3 pm. Registration was done but we were informed that room wasn't ready yet and when we asked for an estimated time for the room to be ready, the Front Desk replied \we are not too sure\"". We also requested for a higher floor and were willing to pay the difference but they were kind enough to provide us with a complimentary upgrade. We were promised that they would call us once the room was ready and on that note, we went to do some shopping. 2 hours later, we still did not receive any calls and we decided to call back instead. After being transferred from 1 department to another for about 15 mins, we were finally told by the Bell Desk that our room was ready but not checked into the system yet. We were puzzled at this and decided to just head back to the hotel. When we collected our room keys, I was slightly frustrated that the whole process was so slow so I mentioned it to one of the Managers at the Front Desk. He was kind enough to extend our check-out time to 2 pm. We went up to the room and it was really nice, spacious and the view was spectacular. We wanted to watch a movie but then realised that the in-room movie services were not activated. Called Priority Services (read: Operator) and were advised that it was not available because we did not place enough deposit yet. We then realised that we were not advised of the room rates upon check-in and we were only asked for SGD100 for the incidentals.I was getting increasingly frustrated as half of our afternoon was delayed already and we were expected to head down to the Front Desk to place more deposit for the room charges. I called and asked that someone came up to take my credit card details for the pre-authorisation instead. When the Front Desk agent came up, he verbally confirmed that only SGD270 will be taken as an imprint from my credit card. I requested for a copy of the pre-auth and he promised to send it up ASAP.3 hours later, we were preparing to go out for dinner at DB Bistro and we called Priority Services once again to ask to be transferred to the restaurant as we wanted to change our reservation timing. We also asked why there wasn't a copy of the pre-auth sent to us and we were then advised that they do not provide a copy for the guest. No follow up was done to inform me of this and it added to my increasing frustration.Dinner at DB Bistro was great, food was wonderful and the ambience was nice. The server (think it was Karan?) who attended to us was attentive and polite and we enjoyed ourselves very much. We then retired for the evening.The next day, we headed to the swimming pool and it was a sight to behold. Although the sun was burning my skin, the water was cool to touch and we really felt relaxed.When we were checking out, the Front Desk agent asked if we would like to charge the charges to my credit card. I asked if the pre-auth taken was SGD270 and the agent said no, they took SGD363 as a pre-auth. It was at this point where I was really appalled and frustrated at the same time. I told the agent that I had to speak to a manager about this because the whole stay was really disappointing. When the manager came, I explained to him that it was confirmed only SGD270 will be taken as pre-auth but instead, more was taken and I WAS NOT INFORMED before they proceeded to obtain more pre-auth. Also, we were charged for the phone call to DB Bistro and again, we were appalled because shouldn't calling the restaurant be considered an internal call? It is a really minor charge that we have absolutely no problems paying for but the least the Operator could have done was to inform us of the charge. The manager seemed apologetic but he could not offer much service recovery. When we left the hotel, I then realised that I wasn't even given a copy of my credit card slip to sign and acknowledge the charges.What is extremely disappointing and disheartening is that for an organisation that brands itself as of world-class standards, we did not experience any of that claim. It is basic courtesy to inform the guest and do follow ups for any issues but sadly, none was done. Throughout our whole stay, we were not informed about the basic details that any other 5-star hotel would have done.The purpose of my writing this extremely long review is not to encourage a bad reputation for MBS; rather, it is for the management to really look into improving their service process and overall, for MBS to truly be worthy of their branding. Perhaps it is just my opinion, but it doesn't reflect well on Singapore's hospitality branding as a whole should foreigners receive similar expreiences as well. If not for the shortfall of service and the lack of service recovery, we would have enjoyed our stay because the view from the room and the room facilities were great. I sincerely and truly hope that MBS will improve in the very near future.""",242
MBS,3,“Soulless”,"We booked our stay at this hotel as the final highlight of our 14 day holiday and were very disappointed. The positives: -the pool is amazing and our room was very quiet-- the concierge who helped us was excellent- the view from the room was greatThe negtives: - the hotel has no character whatsoever- service is not good for the money paid (e.g. they forgot to bring us the newspaper 2 our of 3 days, the cleaning was not more than okish, on our bill they charged us SGD 32 for resort fee (apparently for internet and gym -> what hotel is charging for the gym??)- the main breakfast was served in the lobby- there are so many hotels guests and everything is on such big scale that we felt like cattle- the gym is too small for the size of the hotelIf you can't help yourself and you stay at the hotel anyway, here a few tips- an alternative to the celebrity restaurant is the food court in the shopping mall next to the ice rink. Very good value for money- go for the city view- for some shopping just cross the bridge there are plenty of shopping malls- you also can walk to Boat Quay - the best breakfast ever is served at Shangri-la (at the same price as Sands, but double the choice). Seems to be a bit of trip, but with the taxi it is only 10 mins",250
MBS,3,"“The design is great, but the rest is awfull”","I went there for 2 seminars one with clients and the other was an agents meeting, so all in all I stayed for a week. The location is no good as the hotel complex is so big that you are far away of the rest of the city. Regarding the design, it is fantastic, but rooms are to expensive and service doesn't exists. They got so many rooms and so little staff that although you leave your room to be made at 8 in the morning when you come back after a day work at 5 pm it will still be un done. So at that moment when you want to take a shower before dinner the cleaning guy will appear to clean it. And this will happened every day. Regarding the rooms the air condition is so noisy that at night you will not be able to sleep unless you turned it off.In the lobby you have people going through permanently like in a train station 24 hours a day. The swimming pool and the skypark are amazing, but it is open to the public if they pay a ticket and it is one of Singapore's main tourist attraction. So you paid a lot for your room there andf to use the hotel facilities and when you are at the swimming pool crowds of people will go through it taking pictures and watching you. It is like being an animal at the zoo and people throughing peanuts to you.",155
MBS,2,“Spectacular Hotel and Pool That's About It”,"Spectacular hotel and amazing rooftop pool, and that's about it. Service was terrible, one time I had to call three times to get the room cleaned. Several times early in the morning (around 5:00am), I heard hotel workers talking loudly in the hallway outside of my room, and woke me up. If you go up to the rooftop pool area on the 57th floor, hotel workers constantly ask to see your room key, it get's really annoying. Feel like your in a prison, there are hotel staff everywhere watching you, there is no privacy. Hotel is way to crowded, too many non-guests visiting the hotel. Food and drink prices are outrageous, I would not stay here on personal/pleasure travel. Location is interesting, but far away from the action. Construction in the area makes it difficult to walk to town. This was a one time visit, I will not stay here again when I visit Singapore.",42
MBS,3,“Lacking of doors”,"MBS designed alll their rooms having honeymoon couple in mind. Stay with friend is rather inconvenient when both parties needed to use carry out showering and easing activities at the same time. Some type of rooms are lack of door, no privacy.",636
MBS,1,“Worst Hotel Exerience Ever!!!”,"We reserved an Orchid Suite online. When my wife and I got there with our infant twin girls we were sent to a Deluxe room, a bit of a disappointment and our 3 month old girls were getting very hungry. I phoned down to ask to be switched rooms and was told someone would be up to help momentarily. 15 minutes later I had to phone again as our babies needed to feed and we needed to be in our new room. I was told someone would come up very quickly. 15 minutes later I had to phone again to find out if someone could help, I was not impressed by this time. About 5 minutes later someone finally came and moved us to our new room. Over 35 minutes waiting for someone to come and show us where to go with screaming babies, great customer service. I also asked the person on the phone to have a supervisor phone when we got to our new room (that did not happen, I had to call again after 30 min in our new room, the customer service is just getting better and better). The new room was definitely an Orchid Suite but not what I had seen on the website, not even close. The person on the phone said that she would give us $100 off the room for all of the troubles to this point. At least our twins could begin feeding and someone tried. I phoned once more and asked if I could have a room very similar to the one that I saw on the website. It took 5 minutes to get the person on the phone to actually try to find the room that I was talking about (I thought your job is to please the customer not try to convince them the room I have is adequate, especially for a $869.00 room). I was finally told that they had located a room and that it would be ready in an hour. In an hour I got the keys and went to the next room, frightened that it would not be the proper room again. Guess what? It was a Deluxe room again (if this was an Orchid Suite it was a sad small suite) that stank of smoke and there was a worker in the room that looked incredibly confused as to why we were there, he just slowly walked out of the room in a bout 3 minutes murmuring something to himself. I phoned again and this time spoke with the customer service agent again saying that this was unacceptable. We decided to move back to the second room. All of this took over 3 hours of wasted time. We could have had a 2 hour spa treatment, been to the pool, ordered room service,etc during this eventful trip from Tower to Tower. Good exercise though, didn't need to go to the gym. My time is worth much more than $100 dollars for 3 hours. We tried at that point to enjoy our night as much as possible. I just got the bill through email, as I did the express checkout, and found out that I was not credited with the $100. What a total surprise!!!! The worst hotel experience just got worse!!!!!!!!!!! I have stayed in $5 a night guesthouses in Laos with better customer service than MBS. Oh and the wrong credit card got debited money, TWICE!!!!! I have since cleared this up but again had to waste MY time to deal with a mess that could have gone smoothly if your hotel would have done it's job the way it should have been done. Told a friend at work of the experience and they said it took them till midnight to move rooms, guess it wasn't just us.",93
MBS,1,“Different people different service”,"At 12:30pm we arrived at the hotel. Our check in counter is at Tower 3. Hotel have stated that registration is at 1pm and check in is at 3pm. But then we saw that have one white skin guest do his registration. So we queue up for registration too. When the guest done his registration. Is our turn, the man staff inform us: \PLEASE COME BACK TO DO REGISTRATION 15 MINUTE MORE, NOW IS 12:45PM \"". The staff name is [--]. Is that because ours is yellow skin ? so different service ?""",183
MBS,3,“It is only impression”,"For the price I paid for, of course I expect more from this hotel. The hotel was extremely busy on that end of december when I stayed. Yes it was two days before new year when I checked in. With all the business only treatment, I saw this hotel won't make you feel special at all. You pay the price and do your business, then bye-bye.Architecture of the building is great, both of interior and exterior are good. Room is good because it is new but when you take good look, this hotel is only try to create luxury impression with 'China quality' mateial which mostly only offer good presentation, but they are not.It is only because new thing is always feel good and exciting, skypark and infinity swimming pool with singapore view offered good experience, but again nothing is special.Breakfast is lame compare what you paid for.Overall, what special about Marina Sands is only their Casino, nothing else. It is not place to offer memorable personal experience. It felt like when we use luxury taxi, only about impression but no worth experience.",182
MBS,1,“Never again”,"Simply awful.A check-in time of 3 pm. Having queued for half an hour, we were told our room wasn't ready, and we would have to wait another hour. Then told (we'd booked a twin) that we could have a room earlier (ie, at a mere 3.30pm) with a fold down sofa...At $600+/night, I was not happy about sleeping on a sofa. So - no option but to wait.The room, when we got there was adequate but basic. In prices, this hotel competes with the Shangri-La. It fails to compete in any other way. The famous pool was packed - so we headed for what was labelled the 'adults only' section - next to a noisy bar, and in the area where the public are allowed to come up and take photos. How relaxing it was to be surrounded by 150 people with cameras. Service? Non existent. Food - who can tell? the vastly expensive Michelin starred restaurants are a 10 minute walk away through a shopping mall. We headed for the Mandarin and ate there instead. Next day, we checked out early.",172
MBS,1,“Avoid it!!!”,"17 of us (with kids and seniors) stood there for 2 hours to wait for our \confirmed\"" rooms. It was a nightmare and completely not acceptable for a world class hotel. They told us the hotel was fully commited, but we found it hard to accept as it was already 4:30pm. We paid for our rooms and they should be ready for check in at 3pm. After an hour of waiting, they gave us one room first (we booked 5 rooms in total). However, when we arrived this room, we found used towels, toothbrush and USED SANITARY PAD in the room!!! TOTALLY RIDICULOUS!!!Then it took us another hour to get the 4 remaining rooms, I was speechless. The hotel was situated right next to a construction site, and we could see dust on the TV. Also, we noticed that housekeeping didn't vacumn the floor during our stay. There were also other minor problems during our stay, but I believe the above mentioned incidents were bad enough. Seriously, avoid it at all cost.""",139
MBS,2,“Awful Hotel”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in September 2010 and again in March 2011. The architecture is the only impressive feature of this hotel. Service is slow and rude. You can hear next door's shower water running through your bathroom drains and this keeps you awake. When I complained, the maintenance guy came to the room but explained that it was a design fault which could not be rectified. When you are walking around the vast reception area and pool on the top floor you feel that you have arrived at a coach station in a crowded city as the hotel is a popular destination for tourists and backpackers.The poor customer service was explained to me as being a problem of recruiting qualified staff from abroad. In September 2010 they said it would be resolved soon. It wasn't.",480
MBS,3,“Too Far Away”,"I was thrilled to hear that I will be booked at MBS during my business trip to Singapore. I arrived in the morning and was told that I cannot check in (which includes even just signing the forms) until 3PM. This i find odd as other hotels normally would accommodate doing the paperwork so i can get it out of the way and come back for the key. Anways, i left my luggage and went out. MBS is very far from the nearest MRT station. It's a long walk. So i spent a lot of money taking cabs to and fro from the hotel. In the evening, when i finally arrived to check in, there was already a queue. I noticed waiting time is longer than other hotels i've stayed. When my turn came, i noted that they ask too many friendly questions which to me is not really necessary and is in fact is the reason why check in process is so long. I stayed at tower 3. Rooms are comparable with other 5 star hotels like Conrad or Ritz Carlton. The gym on the 55th floor is nice but small. I noted there are no free weights unless there's separate room for this. The view from the pool is really nice especially in the early morning. But since the pool is not heated and the wind was so strong, i decided not to swim. The breakfast offering is comparable with the other hotels and quite expensive at SGD45 per heat. You can get a table if you eat breakfast before 7. AFter 7, you will need to wait for a table. I decided to just order room service for breakfast instead. although you can opt for a auto-checkout, i decided to do the conventional checkout. when i got to the counter, they told me that i need to pay only for the incidentals as the rooms have been charged already. i asked for a billing of the room as i know our company have special pricing. i also noted that no one told us that MBS offers free shuttle to the airport. We found out only about this when we were inquiring whether there was a shuttle from the hotel to the city. Right across the hotel is a high end mall where the casino, theater and the ice skating rink. There's a food court which is opened 24 hours. MBS has a lot of room of improvement. A colleague of mine had to change rooms 3 times because either the room was already occupied (and he was able to enter the room with the key), or it was not cleaned. The staff did not even apologize for the mistake or even the inconvenience they caused my colleague. Overall, for the same amount, i would rather stay in a hotel which is more central and accessible by MRT.",703
MBS,1,“Avoid at all costs”,"My husband & I both travel regularly. We have both travelled to Singapore on business numerous times over the last few years but never together. However, in February we had an opportunity to travel together and so decided to go a few days early & enjoy a long weekend in Singapore before I moved onto the Philippines & my husband had to work. We decided to stay in the Marina Bay Sands as we had both witnessed it being built over the last few years & were interested to see what it was like. I can only say it is the most disappointing hotel we have ever stayed in. The lobby is huge but unlike Vegas hotels has no buzz or atmosphere, It is like a large unwelcoming airport. When we arrived, the cab had to drop us on the road as it was not allowed to drive up to the door due to the arrival of a “VIP”. So we had to drag our bags up the drive. This is no way to treat a paying guest. In any hotel all guests should be treated as VIPs, especially in a hotel charging so much.The rooms were basic, nowhere near as good as other similarly priced (or in fact cheaper) hotels in Singapore. I would by far recommend the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons.The service was appalling. On the Saturday of our trip my husband & I spent the whole day walking around town. It was hot & humid so when we returned at 4:30 we just wanted to shower & have a relaxing snooze for a few hours before venturing out again in the evening, however, our room had not been cleaned. I called housekeeping & complained. I asked for fresh towels, which were delivered, but told them that I didn’t want to have the room cleaned at that point as we wanted privacy for a few hours. 30 mins later a note was pushed under the door. I fully expected it to be an apology, but tt was a note from the housekeeping to say they had come to clean the room but as the do not disturb sign was on they could not come in. So effectively they were blaming us for their poor service. The room was also cleaned very late on the Sunday.Singapore is an expensive city, especially for alcohol, however the prices at MBS here were high even by Singapore 5 star hotel standards & the service in the bars was poor. So they charged extortionate prices, plus service, plus tax and then had the cheek to leave a space on the bill for a tip.The pool area is quite an amazing sight & the views are spectacular, however, none of the loungers are shaded from the sun & there is very little shelter on the roof when it rains. Also, there are comfortable sun loungers at one end of the pool, but this is the end near the public viewing area so there are hundreds of tourists taking pictures & gawping at the residents in the pool. The other end is more private but has quite uncomfortable sun loungers. So even this aspect of the hotel was disappointing.The most annoying issue was that my company had negotiated a special rate with MBS which included breakfast. However, I was charged a much higher rate excluding breakfast with no real explanation except that MBS insisted that this was the rate agreed on booking. This could be the fault of the travel agent, but I would have thought that once I could prove who I worked for the MBS manager would have adjusted the rate accordingly, but I was not even offered the chance to prove who my employer was, there was no discussion.So all in all, this was one of the most disappointing hotels I have ever stayed in & my husband felt the same. As I mentioned we travel regularly & stay in many hotels both for business & pleasure. If this has been billed as a three star with three star prices, then I would have been a little disappointed, but OK with it. To charge this much & call it 5 star is a joke.",338
MBS,2,"“Great view from roof top, that's all”","Is new, and big, looks great from outside and stunning view from the roof top. And the swimming pool on roof top offers a great view too. But that's all, the rest is just very disappointing. The roof top pool is so crowded, full of people (non-hotel guests) taking photos, you cannot enjoy a relax swim in that pool at all. And with the restaurants around it, there are all formally dressed people dinning there, you do not want to swim there at night too. The roof top is windy, and humidity is so high, it is really not comfortable once you get out of water. Hotel is so far away from everything, all you get is a casino and partly finished shopping mall next to it. Any where you want to go, you need to take a taxi, even for a proper local singapore food is no where walking accessible. And the taxi line is so long, it takes at least 30 min to get in a taxi to leave the hotel.Now the room, granted it is big and new, but at the price, it is expected. We got the ocean view side, and all you get is highway and construction sites, terrible view. And the air condition is so bad, hot, humid, and dust from roads and constructions. I went out to the deck for 1 minute, and see all other decks on this side of thoe hotel covered in dust, then I ran backed inside. Not once I open to curtain again, not to mention walking outside again.TV was not working, wireless phone was not working (the base charger was unplugged), very busy phone line (5 min wait to get reception to answer your call each and every time), lousy concierge (no service offered at all except selling you tickets, and clueless about anything else), very very slow room service.Overall, the hotel looks good from outside, inside lobby, and from the roof top. But do not come to stay here, for either business or pleasure.",266
MBS,2,"“Looks good on the outside, but that's about it!”","Massive hotel with essentially three buildings joined together by a boat (aka SkyPark). Stunning views on the top floor with a infinity-edge pool on the top floor and also impressive fitness centre.Concierge desk staff (as opposed to telephone operators or front desk staff) were very helpful.Unfortunately there were more downsides to my stay than upsides:- Quality of service drops significantly during peak seasons and weekends. Calling the \Priority Centre\"" operator or the front desk is hopeless when you want to complain about something - it is better to physically voice your concerns at the front desk downstairs. Had a serious isue with our room and my family wasted a lot of time waiting around for assistance and for them to call back. The best that was offered to us at first (via the phone and I had to ask for it myself - it was not freely offered) as compensation for our incovenience was \""complimentary late checkout time\"" (a big whoopee...). - The complimentary breakfast at The Rise is better skipped than eaten, with a variety of food but of poor quality for this kind of hotel- Sleeping any earlier than midnight when located in Tower 2 Floors 1-15 (approximately) is difficult with the loud music played directly downstairs at the hotel bar called The Fuse- TV channel selection is very poor - I had a better selection staying in a 4 star hotel in Malaysia- Slightly difficult to get to places via public transport - the closest is a bus stop (there are no MRT stations closeby within walking distance).Good luck if you stay here!""",72
MBS,3,"“Overpriced and Low Service, Please Buck up”","The Hotel charges a very Premium amoint for its Guests, but all it has to offer is the Beautiful Sands Sky Park and the Infinity Pool. The Service quality is atrocious, and everything is overly expensive. Even the Casino did not have the right ambience.Had just stayed at Resorts World at Sentosa, and the Casino experience there was much better.Guys, you have a wonderfull location, please make it work. Till then, Avoid.",471
MBS,3,“What a mess”,"I stayed at the hotel during Feb 16 to 19 for 3 nights. The hotel exterior is great and impressive however the actual hotel internior lacks personality and the service standard was much below expectation.When I checked in around 4:30pm, I was told there no rooms with king bed requested on my booking was available at my rate until another 1-2 hours later. If I need a room straight away then I can pay a SGPD30 upgrade fee. I accepted a room on a lower floor (3/F) as I was told that this is the only room that is available immediately. I was pointed to the wrong lift and had to walk back to reception to check the correct lift for the 3/F. I arrived at my 3/F room and expected it to be a king size bed however I went into the room:1. There was an off smell2. It was facing directly to the construction site 3. It was a twin bed roomI then called the service line and the representative kindly arranged another room for me at the 16/F with no extra charge with a good view. Don't know whey sudden they have a room ready on a higher floor within 30 mins but when I checked in there wasn't. I waited for 20 mins plus for the bell boy to come after one follow-up call and took me to the newly assigned room.I needed to iron some shirts for a meeting that evening and could not open the iron board so called the service line around 5pm and was told that they will send help from house keeping but no one ever came nor was any message delivered to me that they could not make it.Finally, at check out, there were two charged on my invoice which I did not agree to:1. Resort fee - I was told that this for the water, local calls and WIFI in my room. However, when I checked in I asked if the WIFI is free and if the complimentary bottle water placed out side of the fridge is free and the receptionist confirmed that it is complimentary.2. Breakfast - I was informed the receptionist after I checked in that my room includes breakfast and showed me where I should go for breakfast. I had breakfast twice and both times when i signed the receipt I told the waitress that my room includes breakfast and they assured me that this is for records only. Hence I did not except to see this charge on my invoice.The only good time about this hotel is that they served rose champagne for free at check in and there are always plenty of taxis available.I hope that if I stay at the Marina Bay Sands again, it would be a much more smooth and pleasant experience.",344
MBS,2,"“Done it once, won't be doing it again”","OK, so what do you get for 2800$ for four nights? Not a lot is my answer.Stayed here towards the end of Chinese New Year, and truthfully it's a factory hotel, with a big casino attached.So where do we start. Checking was fine, once you find the right side of the hotel to go to if you have a car and want valet parking - head for Tower 1. Reception girls where good, all the right questions, but missed all the key replies. Stayed in many hotels over major events - birthdays etc. Was staying in this hotel for my 20th wedding anniversary - actually told them that and...... nothing. So not really a five star hotel, have had birthday cakes for delivered kids birthday's in lower star hotels.Room, can't really fault the cleanliness. Had a room on the 50th floor - great view. Suitable for 4 people, but some sort of screen separation between the sofa area and the bed area would be a good touch.Breakfast - the only thing I can say about that is chaos. 38$/person for the privilege of cuing for 15 minutes. Staff are run of their feet, so getting refills on coffee can take time. There are two restaurants in the lobby level serving breakfast for 500 rooms so enough said. Actually for a good mix off food close to the hotel I would suggest walking across to the food court in the Casino complex - very good food at reasonable prices.The pool - guests have to pay for the privilege of using the swimming pool - you pay a \resort fee\"" of 32$ per room. That's a first for me, having to pay to use the hotel pool. It is spectacular, but lacks sun shade in the afternoon, so if you want to get roasted and toasted that's fine. You also have to deal with tourists visiting the sky park at 20$ per head..... so not exactly a private pool that you're paying to use.All in all an expensive novelty that I won;t be going back to""",475
MBS,2,“Not upto the mark”,"HiI went to this property in January 2011 with my family.... i was looking forward to this trip and was very excited to be staying in Marina Bay because of the sheer publicity that the hotel had enjoyed and the outstanding design etc. etc....I had booked myself a Suite as i thought it would be more airy and roomy specially with 2 kids a little more moving space in the room is required... I had stayed with Sands - Venetian in Macao in 2009 and found the proeprty to be excellent in terms of service, rooms... everything and expected the same here...However i was reallly put of the moment i went in for CHECK IN at their reception... i was at the hotel at 7AM and had already requested for an early checkin... However when i was at the reception, the lady told me that the complimentary early check in can only be extended to me at 9AM and not before that since the rooms are not ready before that... I was ok with that and went to their coffee shop and relaxed for some time... Around 8:15 i again went to the reception, another lady extended me my room number and was just processing my room reservation however then the first lady came up and said that the room cannot be offered before 9 since it is not ready... I was really surprised.. as i understood the room was ready and could be offered...Anyways i was given my room at 9:30 AM and post settliing in the room when i started looking around the room, i found the overall quality of the room and fixtures not upto the mark.. Later one night i called their room service and requested if something can be offered outside the menu since i am a Vegetarian and not many options were there in their menu... to which the person from the room service said that \SIR, at this time our chef is gone and we cannot offer anything else\""... well this is not the response i expect from a Five Star Deluxe property....Also another night i tried calling the room service from 1:00 AM and my call was answered after 2 AM (after repeated efforts) and the order of 1 cappuchino and a pastry could not be served in the room before 1 hour and 30 minutes... Overally i feel the designing of the hotel is excellent however they are not able to match up with the service expectations of a guest....i was so irritated, that i checked out and checked in at Fourseasons, Singapore... Also on my arrival back in india i received a general feedback form from the hotel which i promptly filled and sent back with my detailed experience... it has been over a month but did not receive any communication back from the hotel...""",223
MBS,1,“Among my most shocking hotel experiences in 16 years”,"I was greatly disturbed by the so-called hotel protocol of Marina Bay Sands.I made the mistake of forgetting to clear my room safe the morning I left. When I reached my office, I asked my office to call and advise the hotel that I would return by lunch time to retrieve my belongings.When I re-entered my room, I found the safe had already been opened (while the room otherwise stayed exactly the way I had left it and untouched by housekeeping). However, what I found deeply disturbing was that when my belongings had been retrieved, everything in my wallet had been rummaged through, removed and put back, including the money I had in there.I do not comprehend what right the hotel employees had in rummaging through my personal property without my prior permission especially when there was money involved. I also felt this was a deep violation of my privacy. There was no evidence that the hotel had catalogued my belongings, and I cannot be sure if anything had been missing as a result. (I had a good amount of foreign currency cash inside my wallet.) My formal complaint was not even responded to for 5 weeks and only after my repeated complaint emails. There was never an adequate or satisfactory explanation from the hotel either, beyond citing its hotel protocol. Shocking. Period.",250
MBS,3,“Nice Pool thats all....”,"Stayed at MBS for 4 nights over the weekend. Business trip for partner & leisure for me. It was an OK experience. It wasn't my idea of a romantic gateway. Perhaps for business or casino purpose of trip?? The hotel seems crowded & busy all the time. Nothing much to brag about our room, very standard, w/o bath tub & we can actually smell the drain after taken shower. One night around 2am, we were woken up by ringing phone from next door guests which was quite surprising, as the sound was very clear from our bathroom. One afternoon I decided to stay in, switched on the 'DO NOT DISTURB' sign & of course the housekeepers didn't care & rang the bell. I let them in to do their job :-( . We didn't really dine at the hotel apart from breakfast as the foods were pricey & limited. Couple times we ordered room service after 11pm, they were shortage of foods. We had to select from very limited menu. Nevertheless, we happily explore nice restaurants nearby or in town with better selection & right price. MBS however is a beautiful hotel (design wise), the pool is an obvious attraction. Location wise, it is convenient if you are planning on visiting Sentosa in particular, as it only takes 10-15 minutes by taxi or Sentosa Rider bus. Around MBS itself has few interesting places to see..... but then again, you don't really have to stay at MBS to experience it all.",184
MBS,1,"“My First Time, My Last Time”","Gorgeous building and exciting architecture but that's it. It's unnecessary to stay at the hotel and endure the pain and suffering to enjoy this. Location is out in the middle of nowhere. It's 2,500 rooms and poor service will disappoint anyone accustomed to five star service - it's simply the most disappointing hotel in the world. Management and operating philosophy is to downgrade you wherever possible (literally downgraded reserved room), nickel and dime you wherever possible (i.e. cannot get drinking water more than two bottles at a time, morning coffee in room for two cost $25, check out time is 11am), quality of everything from food, beverage, to soap in the bathrooms and wall hangings is three star. For the price recommend the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons. For Casino, recommend Sentosa or Macao as this one is small and sanitary. Worth making the trip once to see the architecture and rooftop pool. Be careful, security is sparse and outdoor promenade feels unsafe and filled with sketchy people and vagrants. Keep your wallet in your pocket or it may disappear! Signed, The Hotel Snob.",207
MBS,1,"“Terrible, to be avoided... The swimming pool awesome, but that's it.”","I booked per internet, and as there was no automatic email confirmation I emailed them and got an confirmation. Arriving Friday at night, we missed the 11 PM shuttle, and the staff at airport wasn't sure if there was a bus at 11.30 PM or 12.00. Well we arrived at the Hotel with Taxi at 11.20 but they needed until 11.50 to check us in even though there was noone queing in front of us. They had 2 people working for such a big hotel. They first refused to give as a twin bed as I booked double they said but then relented, but at another tarif as agreed per email. The room was loud with a whining aircondition, first they did not believe our complaint but then fixed the problem by exchanging a metal filter. When checking out sunday, I was suddenly told that our rate was not including breakfast, even though per internet, and also when checking in it was assured it was including breakfast. They allowed me to write a \dispute note\"" but told me that they would deduct my credit card anyway. \""Please come back again\"" they called after we left reception, to which I and my wife wholeheartly answered \""never, for sure.\""""",203
MBS,2,“Downgraded despite paying 4 months in advance”,"1. We had to wait 40 minutes to \check-in\""... see point 42. We were downgraded from the Atrium Premier room type we had booked and paid for four months ago, to an Atrium room on level 6. 3. Despite booking a king-bed, the only type available was a twin-room. We were told, \""You guys will fit\"". Not the point!4. After waiting 40 minutes for staff to find an available room, we were told at 6:30pm that there still wasn't a room that had been cleaned and ready! We were advised to go out for dinner and come back. After an 8 hr flight, we would have liked to have freshened up.3. At 10:20pm, we entered the room. Despite arriving over 4 hours ago, our bags had not been delivered.After politely asking, we were given a $50 credit. It was little compensation for the nuisance, room downgrade and waste of our time.The view from the top is fantastic and the infinity pool is an enjoyable experience, however very poor accommodation administration falls far short of 5 star standards. If we had not already paid to stay 3 nights, we would have stayed elsewhere. Will not stay here again when we fly back through Sinagpore!""",305
MBS,3,“fantastic hardware but lacking in software at this moment”,"Stayed there for early valentine but ended up unexpected as intended. MBS is still new so still pretty much hype on it. With that one can expect constant high occupancy rate. However, staff were inexperienced to deal with it. Expectations of wait time weren't properly communicated to guests resulting in frustration. Requested for non-smoking room, was given a non-smoking room reeking of cigarette smell. Not entirely MBS fault but housekeeping should have detected that and made appropriate actions.As property is very large, MBS rely a lot on for foreign workers whose main language may not be English, so this potentially is a barrier to effective communication.Skypark is about the only impressive hardware at this moment. Enjoy the view, skyline but something else disrupts the enjoyment. The public, tourist and hotel guests are all enjoying it at the same time in the same compound. While infinity pool is exclusive for hotel guests' use, imagine loads of camera toting individuals taking photos of the skyline and with you included in the forground. No privacy and annoying as some photographers do not know where and what to photograph.Overall, a young upcoming property with loads of potential but still lots to improve on. At this moment, its too overated, staff are inexperienced. They should really put aside their 'Vegas' tag and parentage at this moment and start working from scratch as a new entrant. There are more worthy hotels in Singapore and the region.To end on a fair note, MBS is young but definitely trying. They are still sorting out complexities and opertaional processes. However, they are listening. I put up my feedback and they responded on a positive note and were sincere in making things right.So for that, although initial experience was marred, I believe I will not hesitate to give another cahnce when the timing is right.",698
MBS,3,“Huge hotel with crowd and service issues”,"Given the hype surrounding the opening of this hotel / casino, I decided to try it out for one night as part of a business stopover. It is a truly spectacular building with a wonderful view across to Singapore. The exterior design is stunning, something highlighted by the view from the infinity pool (more on that later). However it is a hotel lacking the touches of a Five Star establishment.Firstly, through an unusually non - Singaporean touch, access from the airport is via a long circuitous route. This is obviously not the hotel's fault, however it does add substantially to the time taken to get to & from other places in the city, especially during peak times, something to keep in mind if you are there on business. Also keep in mind that the location means no cheap local places to buy snacks, drink or food - they are all a taxi ride away.Arrival & check in was a sign of things to come. The entry section is far to small to accommodate the volume of cars dropping off & picking up, resulting in constant traffic jams. No doorman is there to help with bags upon exiting the taxi, and I had to find a staff member to figure out where to check in. Upon checking in, I asked for a quite late check out, fully expecting to pay a large amount for this. The staff, while pleasant, seemed unable to fathom how to do this. They kept quoting various figures, and was unable to understand that the maximum I would be prepared to pay was the equivalent of another night's accommodation, yet at the same corporate rate of the night before. Eventually he settled on half the rate, and I was directed to the 3rd tower (furtherest from the check in, no offer to help with bags still). The walk across was quite long, and in keeping with the experience, was filled with people, mostly tourists looking around.The room itself is lovely - very modern and spacious. Bed is comfortable, TV is huge. There are few crazy parts though - Shower pressure is poor, Window shades are automatic... but the controls are next to the window, not the bed (is it really that hard to pull them open or closed if you are already up?), there is a balcony on some rooms... but no chairs or table to sit outside, and the air conditioning refused to get below 22 degrees at any stage. None of these are deal breakers, but are surprising.The rooftop pool is a treat - the view is spectacular, water is kept wonderfully cool, and staff are on hand to help with towels, etc. Be warned though that the same space is used by tourists who pay to see the view, and thus you have an endless crowd of people walking back and forth behind you (more crowds). If you want to use the space at night when the bar opens, there is often a cover charge and dress code - though don't let this dissuade you. The view is worth it.Breakfast is another example of crowds - a massively packed buffet with some standouts (omlettes) and many failures (most hot food was cold). At S$45, not worth it.The final touch for me was checkout. Apparently they made a complete error in charging for the late checkout, and had not charged me for the first night. I pointed out that I owed more money, and this caused great confusion. To make matters worse, they then made up a number of increasingly weird excuses \it has been charged to your central account\"" (we don't have one), \""the computer has made an error\"", \""it will get fixed automatically\"", etc. Instead of thanking me for the oversight that meant I would pay MORE, this continued for some time. Eventually it was fixed, and despite the staff being pleasant, they were simply incompetent.Yes, this is a large property, and many of the issues are a result of the size. However I've stayed at numerous large hotels overseas (eg Vegas) with none of these issues. the attention to detail is lacking, and you simply feel like another room filler.""",364
MBS,1,“DO NOT STAY HERE”,"Starting with the lack responses to my emails before I had even got to Singapore, from the \welcome at the airport\"" being an un-staffed counter with a sign saying \""Bus goes every 15 minutes\"", then waiting over half an hour for it to turn up.Getting to to hotel and being dumped in the basement floor (where the bus comes in) with a mountain of bags I was instructed to drag up the escalators myself. At check in I was told I could have a late check out, which they are currently trying to take back as I am checking out two days early as I cannot stand being here any longer.Checking in at 6pm my room still not ready so was downgraded to available, but worse, room.First night, the party going on downstairs and the construction site (despite being on level 34), meant I couldn't sleep. By 12.30 am having complained (and every time you call then call cuts out and they have to ring you back), they offered me a room change,. Queue being escorted out of my room at 1am, back down tot he loppy (having changed and packed), and being made to sit there until 2am when the new room was available. Quieter, but smelled of smoke so badly even the man helping with my bag was coughing. By the time then then brought my bags, it was 3am before I fianlly got to bed. The Business centre is eually as unhelpful. having enquired there about internet first, I was told she'd sell me wireless for S$29 per day, as there wasn't any other internet in the room. When I questioned this, she said she'd throw in \""as a special\"" free access to the gym. I then carried on looking round the hotel, only to discover the gym is free and there is free internet (wired) in the rooms after all. I am off to the Mandarin Oriental, where I wish I'd gone inthe first place.I have never writtena review on here before despite travelling a lot, but this place is THAT bad it made me!(Pool is a novelty, but you don't really have to be staying here to see it!)""",163
MBS,3,“NOT READY FOR GUESTS”,"I surptised my Husband for his birthday in November, & wanted something special.So I organised the Marina Sands Sinapore, knowing it was NEW so thought this will be extra special.On arrival, about midnight, know one opened doors, a lot of staff standing around not doing anything.Taken to our room, it looked beautiful, however they had a hairdryer, but no power points to plug into!!!!! they did however have 2 power points for shavers!!!!!Had breakfast included, however there was an hour wait, as it was busy, they had opened another resturant that we could go to,the hot food was cold, the cold meat & cheese platter was sweating as thesun was shining on it.The pool was beautiful, however staff agian where to busy talking & not serving.There are so many things that are half finsished, if you where to give it another 12 months, & have staff training, it will be great.Singapore it self Fantastic.

MBS,2,"“Whether you hate it or love it, worth staying one night”","This is such a touted landmark that whether you hate it or love it, it's worth staying in for just one night. With all the terrible reviews that it received, I was ready for the worst, and in spite of the headaches and troubles, I must admit that I have a mouthful of criticism to enjoy spewing and a very memorable stay.Yes, the driveway to the hotel was a mess... long qeues, no porters to take your luggage out the taxi, waiting in the middle of the driveway after the cab driver took out all of the luggage from the car because there were still no porters, finding out that no city-view rooms were available even though I had reserved the room 2 months in advance and paid a premium for a high-floor cityview room, elbowing my way through a very narrow and overcrowded lobby, having to walk almost 300 meters to get to the right tower from the check-in desk, having to wait forever to get the things that I asked for delivered to my room, not getting extra bedding, bathrobes, slippers, etc. for a third person that I paid over USD100 extra for the room, arriving to my room at 1 AM to find out that the sofa bed was not turned down for the third person to sleep in, having to ask at 1 AM in the morning for the sofa bed to be turned down just to be told that there were no more blankets or comforters, going to a pool full of sightseers and tourists, being stuck between noisy and rude crowds that use the pools and facilities of the hotel... It could not have been worse!But having enjoyed the breathtaking views, swum in an iconic infinity pool, received an upgrade to stay at a beautifully decorated and outfitted 53rd floor Orchid Suite (ocean view), woken up to an amazing sunset, and come out being able to say that \I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and it was terrible!!!,\"" have all contributed to a memorable and eventful day in Singapore.My best decision was to have stayed one week at one of Singapore's most peaceful and comfortable hotels, the Shangri-la, before going to Marina Bay Sands with the lowest expectations.

MBS,3,"“lovely hotel - security rude , unhelpful and un co-operative”","we arrived at the MBS relitivelt earlier about 11am. we werent aware that we couldnt check in until 3pm until we got to the desk. so we walked round the shops for an hour or so (which are ok if you have £120,000 to spend on a clock). after this we went back to the reception to ask what we could do. we were approached by an american lady (i assume the manager) and said we were bored and she managed to get us a key so we could use the fascilities such as the pool and sky park. this was good and she was very helpful. we got to our room at about 3 which was in tower 3 - very big, nice and clean. bed was comfy. in the evening we went up to the bar and the casino. again no problems. we then decided to go back up to the bar later that evening but went via out room to get some money. we continued up the lift in tower 3 only to find at the top security wouldnt let us was across to get to the bar they just said they were closed even though there were people up there. we then had to go down to ground floor walk across to tower one then back up for security to then say you cannot wear shorts in the bar (fair enough but they could have said that before we went up) so we again asked to walk across the top decl to get to tower 3 again security said no, even though there were 5 of them across the top deck and they couldve evn escorted us. we asked them why and they did give us a reason they just told us to go down stairs and across. so we did. once we were back at our room and changed we then had to go go back down and across and back up to the bar. we were a bit worn out at this point. we got to the bar and yes no one was in shorts but there were plenty of people in tatty jeans and trainers. again when we wanted to leave security wouldnt let us go across the top deck and implied that if we tried we would get kicked out (even though they never gave us a reason why we couldnt) so had to go all the way down, across and back up again!! i would like to commend one member of staff though, i think his name was redshwan, who compemsated us for all this trouble after we complained. he was very helpful and gave us a free fruit bowl, money off our room and $100 dollars to spend on food in the hotel.",584
MBS,3,“Try it once and once only”,"Please plan your trip so that you don’t arrive too early. We arrived at 8am – they couldn’t give us a room until 11:30 earliest. However, the hotel lobby is not like conventional hotels – there are literally no couches or seating area to kill time or snooze. No shops were open too.RoomStandard, no surprises, nothing special. Must compliment the bed though - it was so comfortable that I had trouble getting out of beds and found myself taking frequent naps. The mini-bar was a so called ‘high tech’ one whereby if you take a drink out of the fridge for longer than X seconds, the censor will signal to the computer system that you have consumed it. So be careful not to take it out to read the label or nutritional values etc. Although our travel agent had remarked that we are on our honeymoon, the lady at the check in did not mention anything at all. I was thick-skinned and bargained and eventually received a bottle of Jacob’s Creek red wine. The room did not come with complimentary internet - not even free wifi in the lobbyFoodWe only had breakfast in the hotel (it’s Singapore! Go out and eat local food!). The service was horrid which is the main reason which drove me to write this review. Skip if you don’t have the time!The waiters and waitresses all appear to be temporary or inexperienced staff. Perhaps it's because I stayed on Christmas and Boxing Days, a peak time. We had to literally track down and fight for waiters’ attention. I simply fancied some honey to put on toast. When I couldn’t find any on the buffet tables, I asked a waitress for some. I watched her clear table and tend to other patrons – after 20 minutes, it was obvious that she had forgotten. So I asked a second waitress for honey who gave me white sugar instead. Even though English is the primary language spoken in Singapore, I gave her the benefit of the doubt and reiterated it was honey I wanted, in both English and Mandarin. She told me to get it myself from the buffet tables. I explained that I couldn’t find it anywhere which is why I was asking her. I surrendered and agreed to get it myself but she must point me to the right place - i.e. which table – be it next to the breads, the salads, and so on. She actually shrugged and walked away!AttractionsThe casino is clean and not bad. I liked the fancy technology like touch-screen roulette and pokie machines. The Skypark is ofcourse the main attraction of the hotel. Hotel residents can use the entire area for free. A good number of sunchairs and towels provided. The pool is further separated into an everybody section and an adults only section. The pool itself is quite good – an infinity pool, with amazing panoramic views of the quay containing the merlion. Great for taking photos. As I understand it, non-residents can also visit the skypark for fee but cannot use the pool (as I understand). Imagine herds of tourists and be prepared to have a dozen of camera snapping at you.OtherFinally, for some strange reason, all taxis hailed at the casino are charged a surcharge of SGD3!Overall the ‘hardware’ of the hotel is very good but the experience of our stay was poor – I travel to Singapore quite often and let’s just say I will not choose to stay here again.",138

MBS,3,“Good but not exceptional - pricey as well”,"We went to Singapore near the New Year break and regretted not having planned earlier as most of the resort hotels were booked. We did go in wanting to splurge after not having enjoyed a vacation for over a year.Rooms were clean and the view fantastic. The skydeck swimming pool is really cool and has panoramic view of the city. The reclining chairs on the deck were really comfy. Check in was quick and efficient. The hotel was crowded when we went and it resulted in a longer queue at breakfast which was a bit disappointing as I thought they'd be better prepared.The hotel is a bit further away from the main city center area and you'll need to take a cab (always plentiful when leaving from the hotel) to go anywhere. The casino is reasonable (nothing special if you've been to any half-decent place in the US). The lobby was always overcrowded, mostly filled with non-hotel residents who are stopping by for a picture or a trip to the top of the tower for viewing.On a general basis I cant say anything negative with the hotel itself - however I felt it was overpriced and not worth the premium for just the skydeck and the views from the room.",182
MBS,2,“Service not great”,"We stayed at the sands for 3 nights in jan 2011, this is a large hotel with a fantastic pool but this is where it ends. The service is not 5 star the pool is fantastic but is so full of people taking pictures you cannot relax, the service at the pool is terrible, when we asked for towels the staff were just stood around talking and by the third time of asking we got told \help youself\"" they just cannot be bothered. We had a city view room which had a great view of the city howerver, on the first morning we had a smell of sewage in the bathroom...well to cut a long stoty short it eventually got sorted the last day it was a farce, we also had the smell of cigerrette smoke coming into the room if the air con was not on.

MBS,3,“Great hotel for do it all tourist and convention but so so for business traveller”,"What I can say is the hotel and the adjacent facilities are huge. Every thing is over board huge. It is not necessary a bad thing. If you like over the top stuff and a lot of things going on this is the hotel for it. More for tourist and attendees of conventions. Not so for a solo business traveller. I would say the most impressive thing about the property is the sky roof top pool and bar. Great place to chill out.The fitness center is not ready yet but there is a temporary one on the second floor of tower 1 and 2. It is somewhat hard to find but you will manage if you ask.The hotel in itself is a bit cold and impersonal but somewhat efficient, I can imagine with 2,500 rooms to handle it would be difficult to give personal service. Had to wait some time for checking in but checking out was not a problem.Overall my impression is ok for a holiday and convention but so so for business.",277
MBS,2,“Beautiful hotel but disappointing service!”,"Without a doubt the hotel looks spectacular and the rooftop pool is amazing. Unfortunately the service was lousy. I travelled with 2 friends and booked for all 3 of us from Australia. When we checked in the room was only set up for 2, and we were told we had to move furniture around and make up the pullout bed ourselves, we were even told to contact housekeeping to organise linen ..... I'm sorry, when I'm paying $500 a night in a 5 star hotel I don't make up my own bed. After 3 hours of no action, I relented, moved the furniture and pulled out the bed but stopped at that, eventually someone came to make up the bed. Then, despite constantly requesting extra water, towels, robe, coffee mug etc for our third person, they never arrived during our 3 day stay! But that's not all ..... There was a horrible stench that frequently wafted out of the drains in the bathroom (yike!) and the floor in the shower had some black grime on it (could see shoe footprint in the gunge), that should not happen in a 5 star hotel. When we checked out and expressed our disappointment at the service we were asked to excuse them as they are a new hotel still learning, again, I'm sorry, but if you are a 5 star hotel and you are still learning, then don't charge 5 star room fees!! Quite frankly 10 months operation is long enough to be getting customer service right. All that said, the hotel is lovely, the rooms and bathrooms are spacious, its just the service that we were extremely disappointed with.",163

When you have travelled a long distance all you want to do is get to your room and shower! A bad first impression. The room itself was lovely, but not worth the room rates that are being charged given the quality of service across the board.ProsSpectacular pool area and great views!Nice room.ConsTerrible service - train your staff!!Too far away from the action in Singapore.A lot of construction in the area.Overpriced.There are far better value five star hotels in Singapore.

MBS,2,“Staff stereostyping female guest going out at night to be a cocotte...”,"My first trip to Marina Bay Sands last month was pretty much a nice experience. I don't rate it as the best but all i can say is that the room is spacious and new. We didn't have any problem with the staff \then\"", as we are out most of our stay. Thats the reason why we decided to recommend my cousin to stay at the same hotel during their visit. But the experience they had during their stay made us think twice if we will be staying there next time. Everything is as per normal when they arrive. They carry our thier own bags to the counter to check in, greeted by a staff over the counter which won't even give you a slightest smile ( Well... Maybe due to the fact that they are too tired to do so... As we know they got 1000 over rooms to sell so they can't smile to 1000 over guests... ) Actually even that doesn't bother them that much. But we are shocked to hear, that one of the hotel staff, which is a bellman in particular, actually thought that my cousin is a cocotte!!!The incident happen when she was on her way out to meet me at a pub KPO located somewhere around orchard road ( Killeney Road ). As usual the bellman will ask the destination while assisting the guest. Upon hearing that my cousin is going to orchard road, he bluntly ask with a smile on his face if she's going to ORCHARD TOWERS!!! ( Which is considered a pick up joint in Singapore!!! ) Not knowing what ochard towers is, she happily says no and repeat herself again that she's going to Orchard Road. Ironicly after asking her of her destinaton, he did not even inform the cab driver of where the destination will be. Maybe its the MBS policy to know their where their guest is heading to and thats it... I only came to know of this situation when we are having a conversation over lunch the next day. I called the hotel to talk to the manager on duty to complain about this matter but too bad my call was not being entertain. The manager is too busy to answer the call and the chief concierge is no where to be found. The best person they can find to talk to me is their bell captain. Who promise to get back to me but don't even bother to take down my contact number.For a huge organisation, with good rooms and facilities i strongly feel that they should proper train their staffs especially in service. Cause thats the major thing that they are lacking.""",291
MBS,2,“Beautiful architecture... stay somewhere else so you can admire it.”,"I seldom review hotels in Singapore because I stay in so many of them and they deliver typically a consistent experience in terms of service, comfort, and value. However, with MBS, I am compelled to share my experience. Firstly, this is one amazing piece of architecture and you really have to see it up close to follow appreciate it. It's almost like a futuristic train flying across the sky. The hotel however, is something else alltogether. It's like living in a train stations. The lobby is cold, impersonal, crowded as hell. If fact, Tokyo train station has more character than this lobby. The service is mixed. Exceptional service comes from the front reception and restaurants at the lobby. Appalling service from the bellboys, housekeeping and skypark. Really, really bad. We have bellboys that insist on pushing their fully loaded luggage cart into a lift already full of guests. Luckily no one got hurt. They come off brash and rude. Housekeeping quite frankly are just not properly trained. They move things around and restock your things only as they feel like it. You should bring your own toiletries when you stay here, they provide some bizarre toiletries that dont really clean. Room was large but not the most comfortable seats or pillows. Room service? Don't order less than SGD30 or you'll be charged a SGD5 delivery. The staff over the phone all have a take it or leave it attitude. But the worse service is at Ku De Ta. I cannot imagine why locals will pay to enter this place. Food fail, service rood, and the view - well, its probably the only thing holding this place together. You're better off spending your hotel money at the Conrad Hotel. I guarantee it.",80
MBS,3,“Good room. Nice view. Poor service.”,"Pros- Spacious room and bathroom- Nice view - They tried to use quality finishing - Walkable to casino, shops and famous restaurants & food court, and places nearbyCONS- SUPER POOR service.  4 calls in 3 days for bathroom hook replacement 3 calls in 3 days for fixing CONSTANT WATER DROPPING NOISE 3 calls in 2 days to settle on the internet charges 2 calls and 30 min to get plates and knife - Bugs in bathroom's shower cubicle and sink",71
MBS,3,“Great views but awful service”,"It was a great place to visit, enjoy the incredible views from the rooftop bar (KuDeTa) and relax in the pool, but the service for the hotel was appaling. Maybe as the hotel matures it will iron our the service isues but a combination of lack of signs, people to assist with directions, assistance with baggage, room service, a mix up of rooms and for the price was a let down.",70
MBS,2,“What a beautiful hotel and how poorly it is run.”,"The hotel is new and breathtaking but there is lousy service and a real disconnect in communication. The wrong party was billed, our crib for the baby was delivered extremely late, the carpet was filthy and in room meals were a very long wait. I am hoping that all this is because they are still getting established. The hotel has great potential but is a long way from achieving it.",262
MBS,1,“Dont go for the room with a show package at this hotel”,"We are a family of two adults and a young child. We booked a club suite for a one night on the awards show nite of the Zee Cine awards. It was a disaster from the word go. We were directed to the website, (beware), it takes your credit card details in, and straightaway charges it, before letting your review your details(unlike most 5* hotels' websites). These room packages are usually the no-cancellation ones, and so was ours, and the tickets which come with the room are the worst tickets in that category, ie you'll be given the last row tickets in whatever category that you have booked. (the hotel's arrangements with SISTIC, which is the sole distributor of tickets in Singapore, is poorly, and the customer is given a raw deal as a result). Onmce the reservation went through there was no confirmation email, till two WEEKS, by when I had called in several times. this despite the fact that room category qualified us as a premier advantage client.Till the day of the show there was no clear indication of row no or seat no for our tickets, so we were kept totally in the dark about the raw deal we were given.We were contacted in advance to know what time we would check in, yet we were made to wait 4 HOURS(yes!) to be allotted a room - mind you a Club SUITE!!The room were were given on the 40th floor, had terrible soundproofing, and we could hear people walking the corridors until 2 AM and also the elevator announcements!",38
MBS,3,“Full of hype and very raw and untrained staff to handle multi-culture”,"Average rooms, very poor breakfast spread, untrained staff who do not understand English and most of them do not have the ability to handle multi-cultural issues. Overall except for the rooftop experience, the hotel is nothing but hype",83
MBS,2,"“Great view, mediocre service”","I agree with what people are saying about the rooftop pool. The bar and pool area are absolutely one of a kind and need to be experienced at least once. That's where the thrill stops I'm afraid. The room was not cleaned well and I found the check-in process to be long and slow. I clicked yes to 'would you recommend?\ question only because of the rooftop view and the pool. Other than that there are better hotels to stay at in Singapore.""",93
MBS,2,“Great building... Terrible service.”,"From the moment we arrived, we were both amazed by the building itself and room size and layout. The staff although very friendly, could not provide the level of service expected from a 2* establishment. It is definitely worth the stay for one night to experience the great views of marina bay and also use of the sky park. But would strongly urge anyone staying for a few nights to check out and move to another hotel..We stayed for 5 days and breakfast can be very repetitive with little variation in foods offered.",102
MBS,1,“I hate Marina Bay Sands - It is a gargatuous themepark; Proof that money does not buy class.”,"We stayed in a $750 Club room and with that comes certain expectations. Excellent service, design, amenities. There was no service to welcome us or carry our bags from the cab or even to escort us to our room. The room was dirty with previous guests' bathroom items and trash. It took hospitality staff 3 hours to clean it. The room interior was average - no attention to detail, no sense of luxury, no synthesis in design. Shower had no pressure. The Club breakfast area served a limited range of average breakfast foods. Apart from their french jams and yogurt, nothing special.",748
MBS,1,“Dissatisfaction to the Core!!”,"UNPROFESSIONAL, TAKE IT FOR GRANTED ATTITUDE IN HOTEL MARINA BAY SANDS SINGAPORE!!!!I would like to mention about my stay with you from the 23rd of Dec to 27th of Dec 2010. We were staying in room no 3494 and were 2 adults and 2 kidsI was quite disappointed with the service standards and the \lack of interest\"" shown by your service staff at various levelsI think with so many rooms and so many guests especially in this season you took the guests and their personal requests \""for granted\""Right from the time of check in where in we were not comfortable with the room to start with every thing went hay wire. I called the hotel desk and asked them to replace our room since this room was a mis-fit for us for a few of the points which I am also raising below, however paying little heed to our request she said, sorry no other rooms available and out the phone down.One thing I cannot stand is day light coming in when I am sleeping and the curtains in room 3494 were indeed badly placed and a lot of light was seeping in. Your curtains when I checked in were not properly placed and a few hours after I checked in,I mentioned to the house keeping staff in person in my room things to be done in the room:1. curtains were not OK, from the sides they were falling down not held properly,please take care of them and ensure that no day light comes in. since English was sort of a constraint, we explained in person to him2. remove the long sofa from the room and put mattress on the floor for the childrenThen again while going out I stopped at the Concierge and told SITA that although I have instructed house keeping please ensure what I have asked for is done because we don't want disappointment on our return. She smiled and said Yes of course it will be taken care of.We were out the entire day and extremely tired, we were all hungry and in Singapore every thing shuts around 10PM, so from Paragon itself I called the hotel and ordered in room dining, specifically mentioning each of my items and emphasizing that we were Vegetarians and hence there should be no meat or sea food or fish etc...in our food. I stressed the point that we are all very hungry and would be in the hotel in say 20 minutes give and take the traffic from Orchard to hotel. After placing my order, I and my family was quite looking forward to enjoy an interrupted and nice meal in the room. This was our first dining experience with Marina Bay Sands.We all open our room and we are all taken aback. Nothing in the room and I mean nothing was done every thing as it is before we left the hotel. We were too tired,stressed and harrowed. I immediately called to speak with front office/duty manager but I was instead put through some one else citing some reason that he was busy or not around. I explained every thing to him, took me almost 10 minutes to explain and all he said was sorry, we will do it now. No remorse could be felt at all from his phone demeanor.Then came my food which was a disaster, we got sea food pasta which my children were supposed to eat and every thing messed up. We notified the in room dining and again wanted to speak to the duty manager but again to no availTragedy had struck, there was nothing that could be done to amend any thing that day.Let me ask you one thing, how do you position your hotel as? Do you compare or at-least try and emulate the service standards of the Top hotels? Out stay was completely lack-lustre for the entire duration, we had to love day light sacrificing our sleep, service was poor right from the word go for the entire duration of our stay and there was no \""good memory\"" that the hotel gave us. We felt our stay to be honest with you \""AN ORDEAL\"". I had heard so much about your hotel but the reality was quite the opposite, I have had one of the most bitter experiences in my life where in I have had to compromise my sleep, my children's comfort and my wife blaming me all across for choosing a hotel who simply didn't care.""",365
MBS,2,“Don't expect luxury - and still too many teething problems”,"Like many others, we decided to stay at Marina Bay Sands after having seen the pictures of the roof-top pool. Let me start with the positive: the pool is very nice and an experience not to be missed, The hotel is not luxurious - it has a cheap feel about it and the public areas are busy and somewhat chaotic in appearance. Check-in was OK, check-out was slow (more than 25 minute wait) and it seemed that almost all guests had problems with their bills, Check your bill carefully for mistakes, ours had one. The hotel still has teething problems: the TV in our room suddenly stopped working and when I called to get it fixed they told me to just switch off the electricity, wait two minutes and try again! At the time of our visit (5-7 January) the gym was not ready yet and the two temporary gym rooms were pathetic. The bed is comfortable enough, the bathroom is OK but we were disappointed that there was no bath tub. Service at the pool was absent - we had to find someone to order a drink. Very expensive anyway. Also we didn't like it that there are hordes of tourists (non hotel guests) looking at you when you are swimming in the pool. We had dinner at the Sky on 57 restaurant which was a bit disappointing. They ran out of the wine we chose and they gave us another one without discussing it first (and charged for this more expensive wine) which is not something you'd expect in a quality restaurant. The dessert menu was pathetic with only 3 items to choose from. On the last morning we found a food court in the basement of the shopping mall opposite the hotel which was good and relatively cheap. I'd avoid the hotel for meals and go to the food court instead. To summarize, if you want luxury stay somewhere else. If you would like to try the pool, book one night at Marina Bay Sands only, arrive at 3pm and swim, have another swim in the morning before checking out, and proceed to one of the many much better hotels in Singapore.",315
MBS,3,“Wasn't that Impressed ... Feels like Vegas”,"With all the hype for this hotel, I was expecting a lot. But when I got there all I found was mass chaos. The lobby was crowded with people. The line to check in was horrendous. The line for breakfast in the morning was even scarier. The drive in area for Tower 1 and 2 is so small that I wonder how they are going to accommodate so many cars and people in the future. You definitely don't feel like it's a grand hotel when you drive up to these towers. There are some rooms that face the interior of the hotel, which I would never opt to stay in one of those rooms due to the noise level. The elevators are crowded and there were constantly people going up and down especially those trying to get to the rooftop level. The infinity pool was nice but everything else was just disappointing. The rooms were like a typical 4-star Vegas hotel. Overall, I was expecting to go to Singapore and have a nice experience but we stayed in a hotel that reminded me of Vegas. And it wasn't a good experience. I stayed at the Wynn in Macau and it was much nicer than this. Even the Wynn and Encore in Vegas is nicer than this as well. The location of this hotel is also pretty far from the main hot spots within Singapore. We had to take a taxi each time we wanted to go out which added up. And the taxis tend to charge extras fees because this hotel is further than most locations. They are building a subway station next to this but even with that I would not want to stay there again the next time I visit Singapore. It's nice to see and stay for one night and say you experienced it but overall it's all hype and nothing more.",331
MBS,3,“- a long way to go until it's a gem in Singapore.”,"We arrived on the 29th and despite booking about 5 months before AND listing as honeymooners, we were given a room with two beds on the third flood when we arrived and told the hotel was full. When we realised, we asked to be changed and were quickly upgraded to the 45th floor. We then had to wait 1 1/2 hours while they found our baggage, which had gone missing. We were staying for New Years, and realised sadly, that the hotel was not prepared for being full to capacity. The breakfast buffet at rise was busy, crowded and we had to wait for a while for a table. One the second morning, we were sent to the sky of 57 cafe, which was worse- we had to wait for a table and the service was poor. I had to ask several times for cutlery, the buffet variety was poor, and at both eateries the coffee was bitter and cold. The real issue was apparently on new years eve- we had to pay to get up onto the skydeck to spend new years- something we were not told when we checked in and then we missed out on ensuring we could attend and our restaurant booking was 'unavailable'. It took 1 3/4 hours (!) to get a bucket of ice to our room and there was no apology for the wait. When we checked out, we had to argue the bill when we left as they tried to charge us for the breakfast at 'Sky of 57', despite being told to eat there instead of 'Rise'. Yes, the architecture is awesome, which is one of the reasons we wanted to stay there- but there is too much development on the ocean side of the hotel. Hopefully, in a few years, this would be a great place to stay. The casino was less than average, to say the least. We couldn't get a drink and the low price machines were too expensive.",71
MBS,2,“Marina Bay Sands is definitely over-rated by publicity!!”,"If you expect no service from the hotel, then Marina Bay Sands is the hotel that you should stay... Interior of room and view from the guest rooms were fantastic...and that is the only good point about Marina Bay Sands. If you are expecting more than the view, then you are going to the wrong hotel..... Ritz will be a much better hotel choice..for the quality of service that you deserved.",504
MBS,2,“Not a quality 5 star hotel”,"1) No greetings upon arrival, not the service of a luxury 5 star hotel2) Checked in to the hotel at 11pm and was given a doublebed room in Tower 3, however the size of the beds were too small and requested for a room change to a kingbed room. We were told by the hotel operator to wait inside room for an hour because they have to arrange a housekeeper to clean another just checked out kingbed room and they would called us when the room was ready. I contacted the hotel operator again after an hour as no call back to our room, and was told that the kingbed room was ready and told us to move all our stuffs all the way from Tower 3 to the reception, and in fact our new room was actually in the same tower! Room cards changed and we were completely shocked after we went into the new room, no housekeeping done! was like the scene after a robbery, rubbish everywhere, bathroom in a terrible condition, the room was extremely messy and dirty and not in a pleasant smell. Called the hotel operator again, NO APOLOGIZE and was told that a housekeeper would be arranged, this means that I have waited for nothing in the past hour and no communications carried out internally. Decided not to trust the hotel operator and went down long way to the hotel reception, again NO APOLOGIZE and receptionist said that a housekeeper has been arranged and told me to wait again. It was 12.30 midnight by that time and where did they expect me to go and wait after a long day? Eventally I came up to the room and settled myself down at 2.30am and slept at 5am in the morning!2) No signal on the TV, called the hotel operator and took 20 minutes to arrange someone to come up my room to fix it3) Telephone not working properly, called the operator several times and they could not hear me talking 3 out of 5 times4) Air-conditioner remained at 23 degree all the times no matter what temperature I have adjusted it to5) Water in the skypark pool was extremely freezing6) Hotel operators defintely needs more professional training. Feeling extremely headache in the second night of our stay, which woke me up in at 5am in the morning. Tried to ask the hotel operator if they provided any pain killers, and understood that medical pills would not be provided to residents and asked for the location of the nearest convenient store. However, the hotel operator said I only got headache which was a tiny matter and told me not to bother! What a well-trained operator and service.7) Hotel with a nice view but location not perfect - If you travel to and from hotel by MRT, need to walk 10 to 15 mins to the nearest MRT station. If you take a taxi from the hotel, it will automatically charge you SDG $3 in addition to the meter fee.8)",68

MBS,1,“Apalling service - impersonal hotel”,"It looks great from the outside - wish we hadn't gone in. We stayed 2 nights in early December. As soon as we got there the issues started - there was a taxi Jam just to get into the small drop off area. It continued in this vain. Imagine waiting 30 mins just to get into breakfast with a child - not exactly premium hotel treatment. The staff were SO incomptent it was funny. If you think this place is glamorous, think again - I am 4, balding and could do with losing a few kilos, but felt like Bradd Pitt in the much vaunted rooftop swimming Pool. The gambling chavs of Asia are the core clientele - and they are not easy on the eye.We couldn't wait to leave ( but of course had to queue up for 30 mins like cattle just to get a taxi out of there.)Avoid - spend your money on a decent hotel in town - the restaurants/bars/clubs inside the Sand are simply poor.",787
MBS,3,"“Architecturally stunning, but otherwise somewhat lacking as a premium hotel”","Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for one night on the first day of 2011.Arrived at the hotel via the Tower 3 entrance, which is the secondary, quieter entrance to the main one at Tower 1. It was however, still rather busy and messy, due to the small size of the drop off point and its awkward design, which does not facilitate efficient entry and exit of vehicles. The lobby area of the hotel was packed with people, and I had to wait at least 30 minutes to check in. Despite the crowd, the hotel only had 3 staff members manning the check-in area at Tower 3. I noticed some people, presumably impatient with the wait, resorting to sitting on the floor, giving the place a feel somewhat like that of a public bus or train station. Upon finally getting to the counter, the check -n process itself was fuss free, with the hotel honoring an early check in request (1 pm, instead of the usual 3pm), as well as a request for a room with a city view. The check in staff was polite but spoke very softly (I could barely hear him), and seemed very new to the job and/or the service industry in general. As per the booking, I was assigned to a club room, located on the 45th floor. Upon entering the room, I was suitably impressed. The room was expansive and well appointed and furnished, with an excellent view of the city. The bathroom was also big and tastefully designed, with his and hers wash basins,large, separate bathtub and shower stall. The room also had a sitting area consisting of a full sized 3 seater couch and a large coffee table situated near the floor to ceiling windows, providing a good place to relax and take in the city views. However, upon opening the mini-bar, I was surprised to find it stocked with personal food items left behind by the previous occupants of the room (half eaten packs of cheese, yogurt, etc), instead of the usual stipulated items. A phone call to \Priority Services\"" promised to resolve the problem, though I had to wait for about an hour before housekeeping arrived to clear and restock the minibar. Even then, I was informed that two of the items were out of stock, and I had to seek their assurance that i will not be charged for these items (the minibar was a automatic one, with an item considered consumed and billed when removed from its slot for more than 30 seconds). This episode somewhat tarnished an otherwise good impression of the room thus far. A visit to the Skypark on level 57 was next on the agenda. As expected, the views here were even more impressive than from the room. But as noted in several previous reviews, the area was very crowded. Thronging with people, the area did not offer any feeling of exclusivity or privacy whatsoever. Furthermore, the public area of the Skypark extended to area right behind the deckchairs of the pool, separated only by a low (2 feet high) barrier. As such, there was quite a lack of privacy for hotel guest using the pool. While there were hotel staff controlling access between the hotel-guests-only and public areas of the Skypark, the very high foot traffic of the area was not particularly appealing. That being said, the design of the Skypark, and in particular the infinity edged pool, was quite a marvel in engineering (though the hotel may want to look into providing heating for the pool, for the water was absolutely frigid!).We proceeded the the club lounge for afternoon tea. A fairly decent buffet spread of food and drinks was available, including champagne. However, other than the sit down dining area, there wasn't a separate lounge area for guest relax in, unlike club lounges in most other hotels. Access for club room and suites guest only lasted until 8pm daily, before the club lounge was open to all, including the public, for a chocolate buffet (chargeable, of course). The checkout process was similar to the check-in experience, which meant a fair amount of time waiting in queue. Overall, the stay at MBS was a fairly decent experience, with the main draw being the impressive building, the views accorded from a high level city facing room, and the novelty of the Skypark and swimming pool. One the downside, the sheer number of guest rooms (2500) and massive crowds make it difficult for the hotel staff the cope (long waiting times in particular), and it seems many staff are still lacking in experience.  If one is after a genuine luxury hotel experience, there are numerous other options to consider ahead of MBS.""",329
MBS,1,“Unsatisfactory Service and misrepresentation of quality”,"Very poor, I will never recommend MBS to anyone. I felt cheated and deceived by the false representation of the Hotel condition, quality and facilities. Over-crowded at the club lounge, sky park and swimming pool; it reminds me of a fish market which is far from the serene and tranquil image represented by MBS on its website and advertising.There is chaos in the Front Office operations, from the moment I step foot on MBS property, I had to stop in the middle of the driveway and drag my luggage across the driveway with no assistance from anyone. I had to stopped a staff to get assistance to check in on the Club floor. She led me to the VIP check, but the staff behind the desk was too busy to attend to me. Eventually, one of them decide that I was actually a guest checking in and assisted me. I told the staff I was booked on the Lux Package, on the club floor. After she checked me in and handed me an envelope with no explanation and no one assisted me with my luggage to the room. (this is crappy service, poor and unsatisfactory service)The rooms was nice, but the view was a disaster. It felt like a construction site, looking out the window. The sound proofing for the rooms was poor, you could hear people and noise from the corridor, and likewise walking in the corridor you could heard noise from the room. (this is unsatisfactory quality and misrepresentation)The club lounge had full glass windows and set with dining tables and chair, this was not comfortable at all. There was a continuous flow of people looking at you from outside, this is far from the privacy and intimacy that one would expect as a Club Floor guest. (this is unsatisfactory quality and misrepresentation)So, overall my experience at Marina Bay Sand was very bad and I would never recommend it to anyone until they get their act together.Regards",80
MBS,3,“Wonderful hotel; staff need training in responsiveness to customers”,"A brilliant, beautiful hotel. Unfortunately many of the staff we encountered were clueless regarding customer service. Check in staff could not find booking, room service took six phone calls over three hours to get a bucket of ice and the taxi rank outside is mismanaged by hotel staff requiring extended unnecessary waiting time. However the location, skypark and facilities are great. I would stay here again; I think the hotel staff need to get used to their new work environment.",211
MBS,2,"“Stunning building. But too big, too crowded and not set up well”","Tried Marina Sands for the first time. Stunning building and location. Skypark is a great feat of engineering.But the place is a zoo. You have to line up for everything. Check in, check out, restaurants, nightclub, there is just no coping with the amount of people, both visitors and guest and the guests needs seem to fall between the cracks.As for the Skypark, it is not just for guests as visitors can pay to go up and this has created a huge confusion as to who can go where and which outlet you can use for a drink. It is good for photo opp but you feel like an exhibit on display when by the pool or swimming. It is disconcerting tom say the least and does not encourage you to lay by the pool for any length of time as evidenced by almost no one using the pool while I was there but 100s of people were milling around on the upper level. All in all good if you like huge las Vegas type hotels with 400+ rooms but they have service and teething issues, especially in regards to visitor on the SkyparkFor me?

MBS,1,“THE HOTEL REDIFINED POOR SERVICE”,"Gorgeous hotel with the fabulous \Sky Park\"". The service level was disastrous. . . . the hotel is understaffed. It took them 3 hours to get our luggage to our rooms after repeated calls. \""Priority Service\"" is redifined by Marina Bay. If you call on any of their service lines, you should be ready to hold the fone for a few hours. give ur vocal chords a rest before checking in cos ur gonna explain ur requirement to several \""Priority Service\"" reps over a few hours everytime u call them. The power went off on our floor for 40 mins with no back up & all d kids were stuck inside their rooms. During breakfast one day, a large piece of the aluminium structure fell 10 feet away from my family. My son was using an extra bed which they couldnt provide from 7 pm till 1.30 AM in the night. It was delivered only after i personally went to the front desk & screamed my vocal chords sore at 1.15 AM. They just dont know how to run their hotel.

MBS,3,"“Stay if you value the novelty, and access to the infinity pool”","On first impression, everything here seems unnecessarily large and pretentious: the hotel lobby, the (attached) shopping mall, the casino itself, even guest room dimensions (which feel devoid of furniture as a result), so the hotel lacks warmth. The unique architecture has instantly made it the defining structure of Singapore's skyline and as such rates will remain at a premium as everyone wants to have \stayed there, done that\"". Some tips:(1) MBS charges more than equivalent Singapore properties, so it pays to book well in advance to get their best rates, especially when short notice cancellation is always possible. HIgher prices are charged for high floors and for the city views everyone wants (the other side being harbour view = a highway, construction on reclaimed land, and hundreds of ships at anchor in the Straits beyond). Many harbour facing rooms have balconies, whereas the city view rooms do not. (2) If a sky-garden visit is on your to-do list in Singapore anyhow, then staying here will save you $20 each, with the bonus that you can swim in the rooftop pool and choose to go up there whenever weather conditions are right (not always the case!). Serious swimmers are advised to get their laps in at the crack of dawn before it gets too busy.(3) Rooftop and views aside, there's little to do here other than walking around the oversized, impersonal, designer-heavy shopping mall, hitting the casino (take passports, be ready for a smoky environment on the main gaming floor!) and eating above-average priced food... until there is more to do here this is not the place to stay more than one night if you want to experience the 'real' buzz of Singapore. Unless your focus is gambling one night is plenty, and thereafter move closer to Orchard Road or the MarinaBay shops in that order of preference.(4) You're connected to the rest of Singapore by taxi only - or else a potentially sweaty walk to Marina Bay via the shopping mall and Helix bridge. Beware taxi queues at certain times.(5) Some staff are clearly still on a learning curve, not surprising in such an ambitious new hotel.(6) Breakfast buffet in main lobby is busy, but excellent(7) Spa not yet finished, so for now makeshift gyms have been installed in a series of regular lower floor guest rooms(8) hold onto any headwear at the rooftop pool in blustery conditions. Indeed swimming is not permitted if it's too windy (to protect swimmers from flying objects)(9) the mall is devoid of stores regular travellers would shop at. Judging by the sheer size of some of the über-luxury goods outlets (most were empty) MBS are clearly expecting to attract vast hordes of high net worth visitors.

(where in singapore do you need to queue for more than 15 mins to check in?) we were so called \upgraded\"" to a suite room but it's was on the lower floor. during the night, it's was so noisy as we are above the lobby bar.went to the sky park. the pool was horrendous, it's was like a public pool; there were so many people there in the pool, with many more people walking around and taking pictures (looks like they were in a zoo or something like that). we left that place immediately. on our way down, we meet this wonderful lady who turn our nightmare into a slightly better ones. she was in the same elevator and started asking us \""how was your stay?\"" we told her, it was horrendous since our arrival. although it was't her fault, she keep on apologizing for our misfortune and offer to assist us to make our stay a better ones; and she did!therefore I must again say \""Thank you very much Jeannie Lau for turning our nightmare into a much deserved holidays, it must be our lucky day to have met you in the elevator; you have stood out as the most caring staff during my visit, and you are definitely much more capable and better than the manager at the reception counter. Thank you for your time and hospitality extended for my family and I. We are truly grateful for your warm truly asia kinda of service.\"" If we ever come back to Marina Bay Sands again, \""it must be because of YOU!! and we will sure to book a Club room with you then.\""""",242
MBS,1,“Not worth it”,"As a regular traveller to Singapore and have watched this hotel being built I thought it would be nice to stay one time and try the famous pool.Checked in at Tower 3 as instructed on an email from them at 17.00 was told room not available and that they would up grade us. When we got to the room we noticed it was what we had booked and I double checked with the website. Not sure what the upgrade was. It took 1.30 mins to get our luggage!! Went to the pool and it was more like a kids fun park, noisy and dirty. The bathroom had a foul smell. The only thing worth is the view but you can stay elsewhere and visit by paying a fee. There is an attached shopping centre that has nothing worth buying and the casino is not worth visiting if you are a non smoker. They allow smoking on the ground floor and non smoking on the 2nd floor!! with an open ceiling smoke rises and it stinks.Moved out and went to the Swissotel an older hotel but much better service and a great view of the harbour for the New Year Fireworks. You also need to take a taxi to and from the hotel.I expect in two years when most have tried it it will be a run down hotel with room rates of $ 50 per night.Many better choices to stay in Singapore.",229
MBS,2,“Visit the Skypark once but otherwise give it a miss”,Stayed here with my wife and child in one of their club rooms that gives certain other benefits (including access to the lounge by the pool). ProsGood rooms. Big with a great bathroom and view. Pool. Definitely worth a visit. Great views of Singapore.ConsThe service. While most of the staff were very pleasant a lot of them didn't seem to know how the hotel works. We were quite often told the wrong thing or sent to the wrong place and the reception area often seemed to have an air of bedlam about it as staff struggled wirh large queues of people. Plus this is the first time at a 5 star hotel when we could not tell whether the room had been made up or not. Apparently it had...But the worst thing for us was the condescending and rude attitude of one guy on the door at the club lounge in the afternoons. He seemed to go out of his way to make us feel unwelcome and actually turned us away on one occasion. Not sure why we bothered to pay the extra for the club room given that - definitely not worth the extra cost. (By way of balance that one of his colleagues was super efficient and the breakfast staff were great.)In summary - impressive building but just come and take a look and stay somewhere else.,82
MBS,2,"“First rate structure, second class operations, third world service - BAD!”","If all you want is to see a nice structure with a wonderful view - then just go and see that. Otherwise, do expect poor service, wooden faces, untrained or badly trained staff - who are very keen to give excuses and more than happy to express their helplessness by blaming their ineptness on \management\"". Expect also to walk long boring distances for affordable food or to public transport (except taxis).For family, the Resorts World Sentosa is a much much better bet!""",129
MBS,2,“Feels like a large railway station”,"Much too large, over crowded and not of Asian standards at all. People always swarming and there is a queue for everything including breakfast. It just does not feel like a property in Asia and the staff is unable to handle the very large capacity. Calling the hotel and getting connected to the reception or concierge is a 6 - 7 minutes wait! On check-out the bell desk asked us to wait for 45 minutes before they could get our luggage and the billing was totally inefficient.There was no functional spa, health club or gym during our stay. The swimming pool on the top flower does not have the required bathing facilities and the loo looks very run down.The only positive - the medical team is good and helpful.",24
MBS,1,“stay for free? no thanks!”,"i never expect these kind of poor services from such a new, expensive hotel. i paid SGD 5xx for a upgraded guestrm (tax included).",47
MBS,3,"“We paid for Club floor facilities, did not receive value for money in this regard.”","Far too many people wandering about. The hotel lobby resembled Orchard Road with it's crowds of people. There was no privacy and a lack of ambience in the pool area, both of which you would expect with a Club Floor rate. The queues were unnecessary and irritating.",113
MBS,3,“Grand hotel but hell bent on numbers rather than quality”,"We found the hotel to be very innovative in design and the rooms were very modern,we took the club floor room which we envisaged would give us an advantage re club floor service and sky park access/pool etc.The hotel seems to have a policy that all are able to access this area and as such the experience was crowded and lacking in relaxation with children everywhere . Pool was overlooked by anyone who wanted to go up and have a look and hence there was no privacy. Our stay was at a busy time of the year, new years,but as a guest paying $500+ per night I think better choices exist in Singapore.",51
MBS,2,“Services really sucked!”,The facilities were really good specially the view from the hotel. But the services really sucked. We were given fraud information from the staff who checked us in and we ended up really disappointed in our whole stay. It was only up to us who did the stay memorable and satisfying.,41
MBS,3,“Guess it wasn'y my day !!!”,"I was given a differnet room from what i requested during reservation. Was promised a change of room by the \priority service\"" dept but in the end , nothing happen ...Awesum view and grt yummy breakfast @ Rise cafe ... :P""",189
MBS,3,“Three Star Hotel”,"Not a family hotel. Its great for people who want to enjoy the casino. For shopping wld recommend to stay at a hotel intown (orchard road) same price. If you want to go anywhere, will need to take a taxi everyday $10 per trip one way into the city. We have a 4 yr old and a 7 months. we stayed 3 nights at Sands then switch to Hyatt. Hyatt was much much better. Very crowded. We had an horizon club room in Tower3. Room was big and nice, but housekeeping staff did not clean the room very well during our stay. Kids and parents were itching everywhere by the time we left. They have a night club access via tower3 elavators - not very comfortable with your children/family in the elavator with a bunch with party goers/drunks. Overall nice to visit hotel and shopping mall, but not to stay. Staff was friendly, but was not helpful. Service does not compare to Hyatt, Marriott or even Pan Pacific. check in/out was terrible. Service, which was very friendly if you can find someone, was on par with a 3 star.",166
MBS,2,“they arent prepare to open this hotel”,"the hotel is dirty, the marble is not well polished, and the room is small. the cake shop close at 9.30 they should be closing late since its a casino hotel. shops not all open. taxi queue is way too long.breakfast was horrible. the hotel man pick the food that falls on the counter and return it back to the trays. my tea has a lot of hair,I even ask my self, what is that?? I call the manager, and the manager simply took it away, but didn't say sorry.replace my tea with the new one, but the cup was broken, they shouldn't use it anymore. kudeta from bali is open here, but no hotel guests is allowed to enter. only those with a one DAY RESERVATION can enter. cmon, even the bar it self is empty even at 11pm? the front door lady face too snob to be true. just stay at the mandarin hotel orchard or park hotel orchard. nothing special about this hotel",192
MBS,2,“Not prepared for peak period”,"Booked 2 rooms: Orchard Suite and Standard Room for 8 nightsWith 2000+ rooms, it is not prepared to handle full/near full capacity during Christmas-New Year period:1. Check-in: long check-in line 2. Breakfast: good selection but most time the queue to enter is very long. Was told to go to Sky on 57 (didn't have the same wide selection) but after breakfast at Sky on 57, was told that the breakfast there would be charged - had to complain before the charge was finally waived3. Lobby: not adequate to handle car/taxi traffic in/out of the lobby, which created a massive traffic jam at the road entering the main lobby4. Room: standard. Was surprised to see a US-style mini refrigerator where they assume consumption if you remove any item from the refrigerator. Not convenient if you want to store anything in the fridge5. Gym: too cramped for this huge hotel. It looks a room that is converted into a gym6. Other: the hotel is a destination by itself because of the casino and the skypark. As a result it is always crowded - though this might be due to the time of the year",986
MBS,3,“Needs time to work out the service issues”,"I stayed at MBS for 16 days. Plenty of time to really get to know the place. I have also worked in 2 hotels in NYC, so I understand hotel back of house operations. (one of the hotels was 4 stars) Here are the things MBS gets right:-Extremely comfortable bed- My baby got sick while we were there and after holding him for literally 7 hours a day, my back was done. Each morning it felt great because of the mattress however. Wish I could bring it home.-Room size- We had a basic room and it was very spacious, even with a crib. I'm told if you book a lower level floor the rooms are wider, as the hotel gets more narrow the further up you go. -Food- By far, the best thing about this hotel for me was the restaurants, and Rasapura, the street food market in the mall attached to the hotel. Mozza and Db Bistro were outstanding. Great service, impeccable food. Definitely make a reservation unless you plan on eating at 5pm! Rasapura food market was often my stop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was dirt cheap, only mildly more expensive that the hawker centers around town, with options of food from all around Asia. Every type of cuisine has its own stall with a big sign. The chicken rice was the best I had on the island. They put this delicious vinegar sauce on the chicken. And the egg custard bao (bun) at the dim sum stand was a great sweet treat to wash down with a cup of teh milk (hot tea with sweet milk). I didn't love the nasi lemak (coconut rice with fried chicken) or the japanese ramen stall. The ramen was bland. It gets packed down there, so we shared a table a lot. We got to meet lots of other travelers that way though. Food is served fast, but sometimes you need patience for a table. The Sweet Spot bakery was perfect for morning lattes and muffins. I'm super picky about food/dessert, and this place gets it right! Amazing staff too. So nice!-The Shoppes- Since I was traveling with my baby, we spent a lot of time on our own. Having the mall attached to the hotel was great when we were jet-lagged the first couple of nights, and for early morning walks when he was ready to get up, but daddy needed to sleep longer. Its extremely expensive shopping (Gucci, Prada, etc...), but window shopping was fine with us. December and January is the rainy season, so it was a good option for those wet afternoons too. -The pool and Sky Park- Absolutely breath-taking. Could have spent hours up here. Read below for cons...didn't try any of the restaurants so I can't comment. I didn't find it too crowded. I know someone else in their review said there were 150+ people. In a hotel that has 2500 rooms, that's not so bad. Especially at the holidays. I also had someone check for my room key every time I went up, or walked through to the public part, so I felt like it was truly for hotel guests only.-Staff- I found all the staff in every department to be friendly, courteous, and prompt with responses to my questions or needs. Room service was efficient, though I only ordered once.Things MBS needs to work on:First of all, many reviewers were here during the holidays. Its a crazy time for any hotel, no matter what price point, and you've chosen to stay at a hotel with 2500 rooms. You can pretty much be assured you're going to have to wait for some things. That being said:Housekeeping- This was my biggest issue. They were not on top of checking when the room was ready to be cleaned. I'd go out for 2 hours, and it would still be dirty on my return. In all my travels around the world I've never had that happen the majority of my stay. I also had someone knock on my door TWICE when I had the Do Not Disturb on. This is unforgivable!! I also noticed the lobby is not as clean as it could be. Dust bunnies by the elevators, and the carpets by the elevators were not vacuumed every day. I spent many mornings down there with the baby and it was covered in carpet fuzz, a little bit of food, etc...one day I even saw a trail of antsDoorman/ cab assistant- This is still confusing to me. I never really saw a doorman. About half the time a person from the hotel would open the door for me. I thought maybe in Singapore they don't have a Doorman position. That it was a Western thing. I'm still not sure. Also, with getting cabs, sometimes there was someone there, sometimes there wasn't. And every time I got out of a cab, there was almost never anyone to help me. I had the cab drivers help me with the stroller usually. Again, I thought maybe it was only Western thing. If they have doorman, perhaps a different uniform would help?The pool- I have only a slight problem with the pool. It was cold!! The water was so cold the baby wouldn't get in. He actually cried when I put his feet in. And I hate cold water. Its absolutely beautiful though. Worth it to walk around up there. Luggage- We chose to bring up our own luggage, so I can't comment. I noticed whenever I got in the cab line though, that is seemed to be quite a mess downstairs. Luggage everywhere, no real order, confusing. I chalked this up to it being New Year's and Christmas.Overall, since its a new hotel, my hope is that they'll work out the kinks over the next 6 months. They've barely had time to hit their stride. I'd definitely be willing to stay here again.",60
MBS,1,“It's a beautiful hotel under a very dissapointing management”,Check in process in lenghty. The reception messed up my reservation. Not enough seating at the restaurant. Food selection is very limited. Concierge response time is very slow when we were locked out of our room. Valet took 45 minutes to retrieve our car. Too bad...Such a beautiful hotel. It could use a lot of improvement in management and service.,571
MBS,3,“Saving Grace is 57th Rooftop Infinity Pool”,"Like most other reviews, I agree that this place is sorely lacking in service and proper signages. This is a HUGE vegas style hotel. And despite it being relatively new, the signages on the lifts are starting to peel off. Some of the lifts are even starting to creak!!PARKINGThe only place you can park is the Convention Center. And getting across to the hotel is a long long walk. So, as a guest, you are better off valet parking for S$12 or be a sucker like me who parked for a couple of hours, took a long walk (plus got lost) for S$10.00ROOMSThe rooms are OK. Huge and impersonal. We had Room 1026 and 1126 at Tower 3, facing a huge construction site. The bathrooms are huge but poorly designed. There is only one hook to hang your clothes. And there is no rack for you to put your shampoo and soap. Yes, it is all the way at the back instead of being in front of the shower. That is interesting is that you can pull open the glass of your shower cubicle to have a fulL view of the Helix bridge. SERVICE. WHAT SERVICE?More importantly, service personnel working in this facitlity, be it the hotel or convention center is sorely lacking in general knowledge of the directions, nor do they carry with them an easy reference booklet to help you. Whenever you ask for directions, they have you a helpless look or refuse to beyond the call of service. Case in point:Lack of knowledgeI took a long walk from the Convention Center to Tower 1's main lobby and had to walk across to Tower 3. Along the way, I stopped to asked service personnel from the Convention Center from directions. No one was able to direct me. On my way back, I stopped by the Theatre at the Convention Center to ask where the carpark was, but was directed to the concierge (who is very far away) while the carpark was in fact nearby.Not thinking beyondAt 9:15am, I was using the hotel's pool and I wanted to access the public skypark. I was in the wrong direction. I asked the hotel attendent where the public access was. I was pointed to the other end of the pool. No mention of the opening hours of the skypark. I walked all the way to the other end of the pool, only to be told that the public area is not opened till 10am.SAVING GRACEThe only saving grace of this hotel is visiting the world's tallest and longest swimming pool on the 57th floor. The view is awesome......with the infinity pool against the skyline. It is VERY windy to be swimming on the 57th floor and easy to get cold. It gets very crowded in the weekends....so go early. There are also a few jacuzzi's against the skyline. It is not enough. The hotel should convert all the ponds (which looks like the jacuzzis, anyway) into jacuzzis.It is a once-in-a-life experience to visit the pool. All other hardware is not dissimilar. It is like a mall. if you have seen one, you have seen all. What differentiates is the experience. But would I stay here? For a very good price, maybe. The hotel may be an engineering marvel, certainly not a design marvel. And if service is a big thing for you, for the price you pay, stay with a Four Seasons.",31
MBS,1,“Overpriced”,"Unless you are paying for the more expensive room types, don't expect to get good service. Very overpriced for what you get - it is better to stay on Orchard road.",63
MBS,1,"“Overpriced,Overrated,Very Disappointed.”",For all the fanfare and hype this hotel is quite simply not up to the standards of a top quality hotel.The focus is on drawing in people to the venue and operating a high quality hotel is only a side issue.I waited a few weeks before writing this review and cannot think of a single good point.I would not waste my money again.,100
MBS,3,"“MBS needs to be excellent, not just average”","Staff at registration came across as condescending and did not put on a smile at all, room was incredibly dusty, food stains on the tables, urine stains on the toilet bowl. Phone in the room was not working, i have a whole list of negative comments and am not trying to be difficult here but like i said. MBS needs to be GREAT not just OK . If this was a 3 star hotel, i would save my comments for myself . This is not a 3 star, it is a prestigious 5 star. so start behaving like one .",385
MBS,1,"“Great pool, terrible hotel”","On arrival even though i asked where the VIP room check (we were staying in a suite for a Christmas treat) in was twice, i was directed to the general check in only then to be told i needed to go to the VIP check in. Nobody escorted us and we didn't find it immediately. Atrocious first impression, but unfortunately i sign of things to comeCustomer service at the hotel was awful. I had deliberately booked a twin room for my friend and i only to arrive at the hotel and for that not to be available. Throughout my stay we had issues, we asked for an extra bed, that didn't arrive and when we chased, it still didn't arrive. It wasn't until 2.45 am (!) that we had the bed settee made up (only after your staff telling us to do it ourselves!). We then continued to receive anonymous phone calls until gone 3 am in the morning. Nobody at the hotel seemed to care about our problems or offer us any type of compensation. For a hotel of this stature and ambition, I can say as a regular premium traveler that this was THE WORST hotel experience I have ever encountered, which is a real shame given that we were truly looking forward to a magical Christmas stay, instead it turned out to be our nightmare at Christmas. We were going to rebook on our return to Singapore in a week or so's time, but that will not happen anymore, and i will advise all my friends, colleagues and anyone who wants to read my review on trip adviser will not to stay here either.Staff at the Sky Park (pool area on the roof) were helpful but made me wait 10 minutes on my first day whilst they continued with a team meeting in front of me....what happened to the \customer comes first\"" philosophy? Food and drink quality was mediocre and choice was slim resulting in poor value for money, we had originally thought of inviting friends, but on experiencing the quality ourselves choice other optionsI would definitely not recommend this hotel, other premium hotels in the area offer much better quality of service, if you want to visit the pool area, do a day trip and stay somewhere else...I wish we had!""",635
MBS,2,“Trully Spectacular building - UNSpectacular everything else”,"What a disappointment. After all I read about it, I decided to cap off our 10 day tour of Malaysia with an overnight stay in a $600 a night room on our way back to Sydney. The hints of a badly run hotel started showing up when we arrived at Changi Airport. There were no signs to the hotel shuttle bus and there were a group of 15 of us who were equally confused. We took a punt and just waited at what looked like a coach pick-up point. When we got to the hotel there was again confusion as to where to check-in (travellers, there are 3 towers that you could be staying in but all under the same hotel brand). The room on one of the highest floors has a great view of the ocean with the many ships waiting to come into port. The downside is that the view is also of the mass construction site so it's a 50/50. The night view of the city is much better so it depends what you're looking for.The skydeck is indeed a marvel of engineering but that is where it stops. One can actually visit the infinity pool or a small fee (but you can't get into the pool. Without sounding elitist, it was a bit off-putting having tourist mill around the general areas snapping away at the pool and even people in it.The pool is closed in the evening ( THIS IS NOT MENTIONED ) and we only found this out later in the day after inviting some business guest over for a drink to enjoy the facilities. A quick call to the concierge and we were informed not to worry as we could have drinks in the bar at the top floor and no reservations were required. When we got to the hotel after dinner, we found out that the \bar\"" was actually a nightclub and one had to pay some horrendous cover-charge to get in. Even if you are a hotel guest. The crowd in the line (yes.. a line).. were in their mid 20s and we decided to give it all a miss as the thought of loud club music wasn't to our fancy. Terribly embarassing. The hotel bar was not much better. The band were positioned at the entrace faced outwards to attract people in. Quite off putting to have to watch the back of a band performing.The furnishings of this hotel are not completed and cheaply done. The paintwork in the corners were messy, top of doors chipped and the large room we had was sparcely decorated that it felt that someone had walked away with some furniture. The same goes for the large bathroom. overall the place lacks finish and one wonders who the interior decoraion consultants were.Service here is really bad and one gets the feeling that this hotel is catering for casino patrons who don't really spend much time in their rooms and are happy with a functional hotel. This is DEFINITELY not a business hotel. Having spent 5 months this year in hotels around Asia, this comment comes from experience.Many shops are yet to open and all mainly luxury stores. Orchard Road is stll much better offereing better prices and variety while still allowing you to enjoy the Singapore buzz which Marina Bay Sands doesn't. The handful of restaurants are exclusive brand names and most have conditions (no kids, set meals only etc). When asked about our stay at the hotel, upon providing feedback; the young staff member smiled and told us he hoped to see us soon???? Obviously they get enough complaints already.I would definitely stay away for at least 6 months then check back to see the latest reviews. Pay the visit fee and enjoy the skypark without having to stay there""",235
MBS,1,“Over-crowded. Badly managed Skywalk swimming pool.”,"Hotel is famous for his 57th floor world highest reflection pool. Yes, it is very spectacular but also very popular. Outside people can pay to go, hotel guests are free. Not only is is always crowded with people, management is bad too. They allow people wearing outside shoes (leather shoes, trainers, sport shoes anything) to get as close a 1-inch to the pool water, with swimmers in the pool. No privacy and no consideration of hygiene at all. Also some funny hotel rules as well. As long as your feet is in the pool water, even you don't wet your body, you have to take off your t-shirt. The reason is contradictorily .... hygiene! Also everywhere in the hotel is just like a overcrowded supermarket. I know it is Christmas time, but it is so close to Casino, to th expensive shopping centre & food court. It is located at an reclaimed area of the Bay and if you want to go anywhere you have to go round big circle in and out. One taxi driver even asked for extra SGD4 to go there!One thing good about the service - all staff at the lobby are very helpful and friendly. One staff even walked me to the food court to make sure I can get there. It is a few minutes walk inside the shopping centre.If you want noise, and you like casino, go there.",43
MBS,2,“great hotel with truly bad service”,as stated with my title the hotel was truly elegant contrary with the services they have.i wish the management would train them and make guest feel more warm and welcome i notice they have too many guest rooms against the people serving them,211
MBS,3,“Just Another Vegas-style Casino Hotel”,"Was booked into the entry-level Atrium room and for such a new establishment, the standard of it was utterly abyssmal!! The furnishings may seem luxurious at first glance but closer inspection revealed poor workmanship and eye-for-detail for an apparent luxury hotel - marble flooring did not have a uniform grain, bathtub tab was spewing water from its tap and shower room's marble flooring was badly stained. The room towels, too, were of very poor quality - bath towels at such an establishment should be oversized, and towels should be of soft-touch terry cloth cotton!Television may be large but channel selection was not very good. Switches and controls to all the electrical amenities in the room were scattered around the room, unlike the luxury hotels I stayed before which have a centralised console unit for the control of such amenities. All in all a very Vegas-style hotel where the primary purpose is to hit the casino above everything else. For the amount spent on the room, I suggest all travellers to steer clear and head for hotel chains such as the Conrad or the Four Seasons in Singapore instead!! However, the SkyPark is worthy of a visit and this may be done for $20 per person without having to stay at Sands.",100
MBS,3,“Too much of a hot spot”,"Positives:Great views. Decent-sized rooms. Large and comfortable bath tub. Great access to the Shoppes. Negatives:Very crowded. I had to wait for an hour to get our car from valet. Given all the hype over Skypark and the infinity pool, there are plenty of tourists strolling around on the 57th floor, taking photos. Not exactly fun when you are trying to relax at the jacuzzi. The pool was often packed and the deck chairs are too closed together. Kudeta is a rip-off. Overpriced. Plenty of restaurants/bars/shops at the Mall are not opened yet. Recommend visiting only once it is fully completed.",656
MBS,1,“A 5-star hotel with 2 star service”,"The level of service of this hotel really shocks me. Staff has no idea of what this hotel offers and the only thing they know is to apologise but without providing me a solution.I booked a Club Room which supposing provide me with free use of the Club at the top floor.... The Club is really a joke, which I shall elaborate below. My nightmare started right at the checking in. When arriving at the hotel no one tells me where i can go check in. When I asked a staff, he asked me which tower I was staying??!! How would I know which tower I am staying before checking in. I finally located the check-in counter and the queue was amazingly long. Waited for at least 15 min to get to the counter to only find out that my room is not available at the check in time of 3pm. When I asked the young lady when my room would be ready, she did not know. After much ado, they finally upgarded me to a corner suite on the 36/F. She put down Tower 2 on my check-in card...but only to find out that my room is located in Tower 1 !!! Staff does not even know the location of my room !!!!I asked for an extend of check-out til 4pm on the day of my departure, the hotel charged me SG$170 for that 5-hr extension... value for $$??????!!!The room was nice with a full size bath tub facing the sea but only to find out the everyone walking along the corridor of the 36/F can have a fully view of my bathroom. No one warned me of this design flaw. I did not realise that people can have a fully view of me taking a bath until my friend told me and he can see me at the end of the hotel corridor!!! The swimming pool at the roof top has a nice view of the city, but in fact it is a public swimming pool.... Non-residents can pay using this pool.... It is in fact a 'water world' for kids and families who are not hotel guests/residents. Staff allows non hotel guests and families with sneakers walking on the deck on the pool !!! This is shocking !!!!! Families brought chips and have picnic on the sun-deck of the pool.... What a scene !!!Went to use the Club (which is supposed to be free to Club Room residents) after my dinner, but only to find out that they charge guests after 7:30pm !!! at SG$40 per person.Staff at the club are not trained.... no sense of hospitality.... the only thing they do is chatting with each other rather then serving guests !!!!!My last day was a joke. I paid for my extension of my last day until 4pm when I checked in. I had breakfast that day packed my luggages and went out for lunch. When I returned after lunch my hotel key/pass denied my access to my room. When I went down to the reception, the answer I got was \Why don't you reactivate my room key in the morning\"" cos the standard check out time is 11 am. I was shocked. The room key/pass is computer code, I would have thought the reception would have keyed in my departure time when I paid for my extension till 4pm when I check-in. Apparently they have not done so, or the hotel computer system does not have this option. But at least they should have warned me. Instead i was blamed for not having my pass reactivated... It turned out to be my fault not theirs !!!!!Guess how much is the room tariff i pay for this kind of services !!??? US$500 + per nite.... The service I got is similar to a back-packer 2-star hotel !!! What a shame !!! I won't even think of revisiting even if it is free !!!!""",138
MBS,3,“Overrated”,"The skypark and pool were spectacular. The room was also nice. But everything else was not worth the price we paid for. We should have booked elsewhere.We nearly lost our patience due to the long time it took to complete our check in. There were so many people in the lobby that we felt that we were in a crowded shopping mall. Check out was not any better. We checked out earlier than we normally would just to make sure that we will not miss our flight.We had complimentary breakfast as part of our package, but we were unanimous in our opinion that the food was nothing to rave about. We had to eat breakfast early to avoid the long lines that would form for those who woke up late.Go stay somewhere else for the price MBS charges.",503
MBS,1,“Not a kind of standard expected..”,"Complete dissatisfactory started from reservation:1. No body reply upon our email about reservation modification (written in Chinese) - No body knows Chinese?! or anybody intentionally disregard the message in Chinese?? At the very last minute (about 1 month prior our arrival, I made a call to hotline as I'm afraid of any surchanges will be applied for the modification) 2. I call the call center to have a secured modification, it works but the receptionist even don’t know he was expected to send me an email, a solid confirmation (acknowledgement), about the changes - I’m very surprised and weird of it!! Anyway after my consideration he sent me via email.Upon arrivals:1. We were arrived lately about 8:30pm, but the registration not as smooth as I expected from a well-recognized hotel like yours (Sands Hotel!!) – not friendly enough and not helpful to a more speedy check-in, keep talking with his colleague in Cantonese but speak to us with our (both the receptionist and us) foreign languages (in English - not comfortable at all honestly – he must know that HK and Macau people talk Cantonese as well and rather than English!!) – this is a sole matter on localized and customized guest-oriented services only!!2. At the reception, we were confirmed that we are in price of 3 people in a twin room (That was more than HKD4K for a night!!), with an added rollaway bed (i.e. we will have 3 separate beds for 3 adults) and 3 breakfasts the day after - but finally, keeping no body care and no rollaway bed coming even after the mid-night passed!! I call the guest care in-house hotline for more than 6 or 7 times and sometime the pre-recorded message telling me that all lines are busy – I can’t imagine this is a kind of 5-star luxury hotel service do!! I was confused I’m calling the call-center to a bank or a cell phone hotline instead not a hotel!! - from when we just arrived (i.e. maybe 9pm) to even after we finish our dine-out and hang-out then back to hotel (i.e. 12:30am) (I felt very very not happy on this, especially the receptionist who pick-up my call speak to me “Mr. Lei, good morning may I help you….” - how I can have a good morning??!! – I even don’t have my bed after the mid-night gone!! Finally the house-keeping came and to see if the rollaway size is fit to the room (weired!!) then finally the bed was really after his 2nd coming – finally settled by 1:20am.Cleanliness:1. The bathroom was not cleaned completely, with a unfavorable smell from the toilet bowl. The guest care told me that they will have house-keeping to clean-up again and with spray some air-freshener – At the very beginning I was doubt on their solution as I really couldn’t imagine this is a matter of the daily cleanliness - but very fortunately it works lastly - that means, undoubtedly, the room was not clean-up thoroughly!! (not acceptable!!)",281
MBS,3,“Big fat dissapointment”,Booked a suite for my birthday for the wife and I. We got there at 1pm and the queue to check in was very long so we went for a leisurely lunch. When we finally checked in at 3pm we were told that our designated room was not ready. The kind receptionist noted it was my birthday without me prompting and very kindly upgraded our room for immediate check in and extended our checkout time. Thereafter making our way to tower 3 I noted there was a separate check in desk there without the queues and I wondered why this wasn't pointed out to save a lot of people queuing?The room was well appointed and the views were spectacular. The sky pool was very public and crowded. After dinner we wandered around the casino and shoppes to return to our room after ten pm. We were dismayed to find there was no turn down service despite the make up room sign being on. My wife had to walk down the corridor to get fresh towels from the chambermaid.  I called to arrange a visit to the spa the next day and was unable to get through as the line was dead. Thenext morning when we went down for breakfast the queue was very long and we were directed to the rooftop cafe Sky57. Nice breakfast but it was not complimentary Although my room rate came with breakfast.The check out queue needless to say was very long and I used the express check out drop box. The final bill was $700 for one night stay. It was not worth it by a longshot. Next birthday will be by the beach somewhere nice.,282
MBS,3,"“The view, pool and room are fabulous...other areas need improvement.”","Stayed at this new establishment twice. The skypark has really stunning view of Singapore landscape, and the rooms are very spacious and nicely furnished with either marina center's view or harbour(and expressway) view. There's also a luxuriousbath tub in the huge bathroom too. I must say the rooms are of 5-6stars standard. a dip in the pool on the top floor was an experience indeed but too crowded during weekend and also too \opened\"" for visitors to roam about. It will be better if there's more privacy for hotel guests.However, the praises stopped there. check in could be faster and most important of all, the staff benefits should be risen so that they might perform their duties with at least a smile or more warmth? Twice there, same feeling. not sure if amiable attention was paid to overseas tourists but not to locals like us. To be fair, the doorman uncle was a nice helpful person, the housekeeper was alright(although little details were overlooked such as refill of sugar and coffeemate not done, baby cot was took a long time to arrange...), a few waitresses at The Rise were nice too. But, not the higer ranking staff. The captain at The Rise restaurant was uptight and curt, not really a pleasant feeling. Generally, the hotel staff seems to be in need of some smiles.I really hope that the hotel will improve on hospitality which is actually the basic requirement of this industry, and not just banking in solely on the amazing views of the location provides.On another note, the waiting time for the car to be sent up at noon time which is peak hour for checkout took a bit too long.""",13

MBS,2,“Overall Good but not fair”,"I would be able to say that overall is good but hotel is not fair for us. We came here at 3:30pm and we can only check-in one room out of 3 rooms since the rest are not ready. Finally, the last room we can get from hotel is 6:30pm. I think hotel should compensate us. We (6 adults and 4 kids) were waiting in the same rooms for 3 hours!When I ask for late check out, they said they were able to give us only 2:00pm. The reception staff said they give 3 hours more to check in late (from 11:00 to 2:00pm). I think they did not get my point. Even I came here at 11:00, they cannot give the room to me anyway. They deliver the last room to me 7 hours late!!! Hotel is not fair for us.",48
MBS,2,“bad experience”,"to many rooms, it's like a subway station many people at any moment in a lobby, in a skywalk (20 singapore dollars for visiting the skywalk for all person not staying at the hotel) service is slow for the same price check another hotel in singapore much better",253
MBS,2,“What a complete rip off”,"We arrived in Singapore and waited for almost 90 minutes for the worlds slowest and poorest bus hotel shuttle. Take a cab or book an alternate shuttle if you want to get there in a reasonable amount of time. Checked in a whole 30 minutes prior to the 3pm check in - how lucky we were?!! Room had a great view and the club lounge is great - they have great food and the service here is awesome!!! its what you expect from the rest of the hotel staff but no luck! Same as some of the other reviews - we were rudely asked to leave the skydeck prior to 10pm? On the day were to checked out we asked if we could check out of the room, but just sit up near the pool to use the net - 'No chance' we were told, only a certain number of people are allowed up there.... we came down from the club lounge at exactly 1pm as ordered...... big surprise was that we were the only people in the lcub lounge at 1pm - so I guess no one is allowed to be up there...? Anyway for 750 with the taxes it is a disgrace - you can stay at the interconntinental for the same price for 3 nights in a club room and they are more than happy to let you hand around in the lounge all day on your day of departure. Save your money and stay somewhere better than this place.",333
MBS,3,"“nice rooms, nice view, nice concept BUT too big for their own good.”","Just went here last weekend as a treat for my family. My brother had a 5 month old baby and we drove down from KL. The rooms were ready early (noon) and had a baby cot and baby tub ready in the rooms which was great. Check in was quick and all was well.Issues came on the second night when we were up on the 57th floor enjoying the night view and we were taking some photos on the deck. A guard comes up to us and says that the deck is closed at 11pm. When we asked where we were supposed to go he said 'go back to your hotel room'. Er...okay. Not exactly the best thing to say to guests. What more the Ku De Ta bar was open til late and there was a chocolate buffet bar that was open til midnite for the public so how can the deck be closed? the guy on the 55th floor also told my dad he could not come up to see us because it was closed at 11pm and he only let my dad up when he told them that he was staying in a club room (which should matter anyway). Come the next day when we were going to leave - we got a late check out at 2pm which was good and we used the express check out (just fill up a form and you're good to go) and was happy that there was no fuss. we went to get our cars from the valet but tada! - they said it'd take 1 hour to get our cars from the carpark. so there we were with the baby and all our bags waiting in the lobby. one car came up in about 20 minutes and the other took 45 minutes.The view is nice, the rooms are nice and lots to do there with the shopping and casino but basically they don't have enough staff to service the hotel and guests.",111

MBS,3,“Room for improvement”,"On the whole, the experience is fine but improvements in area of respond time can be improved greatly especially between internal staff. Reminder calls for request happens very frequently. Wireless connections to the internet and mobile connections drop off very frequently especially on high floors. Minor problems like flushing and drainage was experienced too.Checking in and checking out waiting time should be improved especially weekends.On the whole, the place is still recommended for stay for the accessibility and amenities.

MBS,1,“Terrible Hotel Service Ever Experienced. Shame on the 5 Stars!!!”,"This Hotel is only for the Casino player who only crashes on the bed!Only good thing was the view from our room (city view, 30th floor, Tower 3) was awesome.Here are the bad things that you will may experience.1) Reservation is useless! When I made a reservation online, I put a note of \Wheelchair-access room is required\"". After that, via separate email to the reservation dept, requested King size, & City View room along with wheelchair access room. And I had a kind quick confirmation emails from MBS reservation department. When we arrived to the hotel lobby at the check-in time(3pm), a room that we requested was not available and they told me that we had to wait 2-3 hours for the room to be ready. I demanded for 20 min fiercely and finally got a room. 2) Guest Service takes forever We asked for a wheelchair to be brought up to our room and they said it would be done in 15 ~ 20 min. I called 4 times for 1 hour and still did not arrive. When we came back to the room, they left the wheelchair in our room even though we turned on \""Do Not Disturb\""!!!! After room service dinner, we asked in-dining dept to remove the table, never came and we put our table outside of the door. Guess what, they just removed the table when they delivered our Breakfast!!!3) Valet Parking is NOT Free! You have to pay $12 for 24 hours just for in-house guest. So if you have your car and staying more than 24 hours, guess you have to win some money at Casino.4) Messy as much as you can imagine Main Lobby for your first entrance to the hotel is scrambled with Taxis and Valets. Parking staffs do not know where to guide the cars and no expertise shown. Sky Park is not something you can imagine as quite, tranquil or cozy. Jacuzzis are filled with kids looking like some scenes.  Noise from other rooms (kids screaming 24 hours) can be heard 24 hours. Overall, this hotel is so new that everything is not mature enough to be rated as 5-Star hotel. Staffs are rookies, automatically the level of service is not up to the standards.If you only want to do a deep dive for the casino without any sleeping, sure this is the place that you can play at Casino.""",208
MBS,3,“Very disappointing hotel!”,"At check-in, this hotel is like being at a railway station \Grand Central\"", people every where! You need to cue-up to check-in, a long line to wait, then to find out our second room we booked was not ready! We drop our luggage in the first room and head up to the \""famous-Skypark to have a look and have some lunch/snack at 3:00pm, we were told no food was being served by its two restaurants, only restaurant was available for executive floor guests only-so the rest can't pay! Next morning we decide to have a swim at their famous Skypark. Yes the view from up top was nice but not breath-taking, but the problem was anyone from the public can go up to the Skypark-what we have are people with their cameras taking snap shots at us and there were no privacy. We decided to leave and check-out. Again at check-out, you need to line up/cue to do so. This is no five star hotel, the rooms are nice but not for a five star. We paid five star prices.The only good part was their duty Manager did listen to our complaints and she did make us feel a lot better by refunding for one of our rooms.""",15

MBS,1,“Bad Experience at Marina Bay Sands”,"This hotel is unable to cope with full occupancy. We booked 4 rooms for 4 couples, checked in at 3pm (checkin time) and rooms were not ready. Were told to visit the SkyPark and they would call us when rooms were available. Went to SkyPark@57 who cud not decide if their bar was open or not. Eventually agreed to serve us. Waited till 5.30pm and decided to go and check on rooms as we were never contacted by mobile phone. Reception told us rooms were allocated about an hour ago and attitude was one of \why didn't you check\"". We informed them that they had told us they wud call us. Then they cudn't find our bags. Went to our rooms anyway and they eventually sent the bags to us 20 mins later. My room was on the 3rd floor and I practically had the expressway traffic in my room. Cudn't sleep well the whole night with traffic noise coming thru even the double glazed glass. Room bath plumbing was noisy with water flow in drains rather loud whenever neighbouring room took a shower - woke me at 7am on a Sunday! Staff try hard to please but the system and infrastructure is just not able to cope with a full occupancy. I pity the Japanese family with 2 young kids who waited 3 hours for their room to be ready.""",41
MBS,3,“Bad front & reservation service”,Didn't give hotel the best values of their money. As paying almost the same price but 1 get with breakfast for 2 but another 1 get nothing. Valet parking was like a mess ... Pay for high parking but bad service.,56

MBS,1,"“A total disappointment, service standards are deplorable”","We stayed for just 1 night as it was meant to be a staycation for the extended family. From the moment we arrived, the entire experience felt like we had booked a 3 star hotel instead of a 5 star. The entire parking lot was full, so we were forced to valet. It took 45 minutes to check in and one of our rooms was not ready for 2.5 hours. To check on the status of this room, we had to queue for another 20 minutes as no one was answering our calls- it didn't help that there is insufficient signage as to where to queue so there were lots of other harassed guests who were also in the same situation as us, all clamoring for the attention of the staff. The entire lobby was filled with guests, most of which were still waiting for their rooms and this was at 5.30 PM. Our room was fairly spacious but the carpet was wet. When we called for assistance to do up our sofa bed for our child, we had to call twice, got told that the hotel is running at full capacity and hence it will take a while - but they never came. We had to make do with whatever we had in the room. The wide balcony which is meant to provide a scenic view of the bay was filthy and looked like it has never been cleaned. It rained while we were at the hotel and the lobby flooded. When morning came and we went for breakfast, it was another queuing event. We were re-directed to make shift breakfast venues in their bar and convention center. Breakfast was a stressful affair and 7 of us were squeezed together on 1 miserable coffee table (we were in the lounge of a bar). Breakfast itself was poor, with food that is equivalent only to a 3 star hotel. Checking out and waiting for the valet to retrieve our car was of course again a major queuing affair. The service standards and ambience is a complete disappointment . If you are here to have a holiday, the stress levels in this hotel leaves you needing another vacation.",151
MBS,2,"“Not for kids, expensive, far away, no places to have a dinner.”","Nice design, very big. Rooms are big and not bad, but If you chose room facing to the ocean it will facing to the highway and construction site. Even if it is very high floor you wont be able to open the balcony because of noise.Skypak pool is nice but water there is unberrible cold - you cant really enjoy the view.Restaurant are very expensive, food quality is poor, definatelly dont worth the money you spend. Very sloght chance to get seats with view. Restrictions for kids below 10 years old. IMHO it is impossible to have a dinner there. Or you pay double or tripple for skypark with average food quality and no view because no seats outdoor or you have to have a lunch or dinner at the basement without windows. Buch better to stay in hotels in the city (swisshotel stamford, meritus mandarin, hilton etc - big choice).",569
MBS,1,“A very bad experience”,"Giving the price and number of stars of this hotel, I will not recommend anyone to stay here. The service is extremely bad. It takes more than one hour of the shuttle bus going to this hotel (normally by taxi it is just 15 mins) as it has 4 stops at the airport and it takes so long to wait at each stop and the driver even allows local Singaporean (later found out they are fans) to get on this bus for a free ride. When we arrived at hotel, the first thing we saw is people people people (we found out later than there were celebrities staying at this hotel) so a lot of fans were grouping at the hotel and the hotel seemed not interested to do any crowd control. Once we got in the hotel lobby, there was a big area with water on the floor as the water fountain on the side was leaking water?! And there was no direction to where the check-in counter is and we have to run into different directions to find it with so many people blocking the way.The next day, we went down to have breakfast and there was a very long queue, and we were led to another place for breakfast that takes a long way to walk, and it was just a temporary area with bad food and bad services. Later on, we called the operator from our room trying to find out the opening hours and transportation to Universal Studios. We can only be able to talk to someone after 10-15 mins, as no one was picking up phone calls or the line simply cut off. (I have never experience this in a 5-stars hotel.) Finally, we got someone telling us that Universal Studios opens at 9am and there is a shuttle bus coming at 8:25am to pick up, then we were transferred to the concierge, another person told us it opens at 10am instead and bus is coming at 9:25am. Anyway, we bought 4 shuttle bus hop-on tickets in town.On day 2, we went to breakfast at the hotel lobby, which the food is so much better but still we need to wait for a long time. We went out to the bus stop and found that there’s a Marathon going on outside the hotel, we asked the hotel if the bus is still coming, the hotel said yes. So we waited at the bus stop but felt no vehicle was coming, so I went back to the hotel and asked again, this time another staff told me the bus was cancelled due to the Marathon. We need to walk to the casino side and took a taxi from there. Then I called the bus company to asked for a refund, the staff said there’s no refund…Lastly, the sky park, it is quite small and crowded, and I think the staff at the park didn’t really check the ID of people getting in (it is just for room guests and people who bought the pass). After we swam, we tried to find the shower facilitied but we cannot find any, so we asked the staff there, and the answer was: “Sorry, I am not sure.”…There are still so much more incidents we had at this hotel…In summary, at this price, I would suggest a much more established hotel down town, NEVER consider Marina Bay Sands…",126
MBS,3,"“Expected much more, nice looking but more like a shopping mall than hotel”","Check in under Tower 1 was overcrowded and more like entering Suntec City then a hotel. People that I assume are not guests are walking around everywhere and quite noisy. Would be good if you could check in without being in the main thoroughfare. We stayed on the 37th floor in Tower 3, the room was nice and clean and fantastic view over the construction site but sound proof. We ate at the Rise Restaurant and found it expensive even for Singapore standards. The Sky Park is fantastic but again it loses appeal for a hotel guest with piles of tourists taking pictures. The guest only section offers little privacy. Drinks are good as long as you like paying $20 for a beer. Not for me.",120
MBS,3,"“\Why pay more when u cannot meet ur expectations\""”""","The only thing I love about the sands is the building architecture, especially the pool and it's view (and of course the casino).

They have no bathtub at The 2nd cheapest room-the atrium premier (at least I paid for that room , am not sure they give us the right room or not ). And becareful for the concept of free daily bfast, u should ask them how many person get the free-bfast.

MBS,3,“good experience but will not stay there again - the personal touch is not there.”,"I guess it's because MBS is still in its teething stage and therefore there were a few hiccups during our stay. The hotel was new and nice but over crowded and therefore service wasn't up to its standard. We had to change room twice and on the second night the mini bar was locked - no one came to fix it. Then our phone line got problems too. We went to the food court for lunch on the second day and their gas was cut off - so no freshly cooked food for us. The shopping experience was good though, with almost all the brands were there. It was nice to stay and experience it but I would not come back for another stay - not worth the money.",122
MBS,1,“Disastorous experience”,"The entire stay form the checking in to checking out was disastrous. The highly unporfessional , understaffed , lack of systems made the experience worst. Any service requested during the stay took forever. While the hotel is inspirational, that it is built on the reclaimed area from the water, and built in a very short period of time. The swimming pool on the 57th floor is awesome. However, the entire hotel looks more like a shopping centre than a hotel. The way all the facilities such as restaurants, theaters are built gives it a look of shopping centre with clutter rather than serene place, one would expect from a hotel of such stature.All in all NOT A GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY.",611
MBS,1,“WORST SERVICE EVER -- save your money and go elsewhere”,"The swimming pool is absolutely beautiful, and really the only good thing about the place. For a premium hotel, the service was absolutely HORRIBLE. The staff made several mistakes (which is understandable). What was truly unacceptable is that they did not even bother to apologize for the mistakes and occasionally even blamed us for them. Compared to other hotels we've stayed at, where the guest relations manager would personally call to apologize for the mistakes and even offer some kind of compensation, the level of service and interest in customer feedback at MBS was truly abysmal. About halfway through the stay, we gave up calling the staff for help. Why bother giving feedback when the staff take several minutes to even answer the phone, and barely make any effort to address your complaints when they finally listen to you? Maybe they get so many complaints that they've stopped caring about customer feedback.The worst example was probably when we tried to use the Nespresso machine. After drinking some coffee, we found had been using a used coffee capsule from a previous guest (instead of fresh coffee) because it had not been cleaned out. (It was our first time using a Nespresso machine, so we didn't realize there was a used capsule inside when we stuck in a new one.) When we highlighted this issue to the staff, nothing was done to rectify it and there was NO apology whatsoever. They could have at least offered to teach us how to use the machine properly, or said that they'll clear out the used capsules in the future so similar problems won't happen again. We got a curt \oh okay\"" and that was it.Several other incidents:- At check-in, the staff forgot to return my credit card and told me I'd forgotten to take it back. (If you ask for my credit card, shouldn't the onus be on you to return it when you're done with it? I've been to some places where they hang on to your credit card for your entire stay.) Anyhow, she offered to send it up to my room. Two hours later, I had still not received it. I had to call the front desk, which took several minutes to track it down. I eventually went down to the front counter get it myself because I didn't trust the staff not to lose it again.- At check out, $50 destination credit (part of my room package) was not taken off my bill until I pointed it out to the staff. I was told that the credit could not be offset against our meal at Santi, despite the fact that we had confirmed with the phone operator earlier that it would be applicable there. The check out staff was completely unapologetic about the mistake, and finally said condescendingly that he would make an exception in our case, but they would not allow such deductions in the future. (As if I intend to return......)- Also, information from the check out staff on parking fees was also NOT accurate -- we were told that hotel guests would automatically be given the subsidized rate upon exiting the car park. But this turned out to be false when we drove out, and we had to negotiate directly with the car park operator instead. We even got a lecture from the car park operator about how we should have bought the exit ticket from the transport desk.Other minor gripes:- The $20+ panino sandwich from in-room dining was ridiculously small.- The room was not properly cleaned -- litter under the chairs, dust on the mirrors, dirty stains on the bathtub, and coffee stains on the coffee machine.""",94
MBS,3,"“Superb view from the room, skypark is great, however, service sucks...”","I did online room reservation and have requested for a King Sized bedroom, but when I checked in at 3:30pm, no king size bed is available.

When I went back at 6:30pm, the reception told me that king sized bedroom is still not available. Than they upgraded me to a suites, and told me it's a complimentary room upgrade for me.",105
MBS,3,“Industrial scale turism”,"BAD:The first impression is like arriving to a big train station or airport. The Lobby atmosphere is far from being cozy, even though the architecture is great.

The pool is crowded, it's difficult to get the impression of exclusivity.GOOD: Got a room with astonishing view over Singapore. The quality of the rooms is great. It includes a double sofa-bed used by our 2 kids.Skypark is awesome. Absolutely, the best views over Singapore",375
MBS,3,“Stunning views but services... not so great”,"We stayed at Horizon rooms on 29th floor and the room itself was gorgeus. All wall windows with view over the city and bathroom great. Hotel's rooftop pool area is propably the best thing in this hotel, 57th floor's skyline, hot summer day and cool mojito in your hand. Talking about enjoying life :) Hotel's outside is also one of a kind that you don't see everywhere, have to give credit to designers...Unfortunately the service level of this place doesn't match it's 5-star appearance. As we checked in nobody offered to carry our bags or at least point to us where we could leave baggages. Secondly we were wondering why on earth the staff wants to fill our minibar between 9am and 10am. They rang our doorbell like 10 times before we opened the door... in our bathrobes on. Thank god I wasn't with my girlfriend... They did this everymorning and even in checkout day!There are still lots of construction works going on, even in the mall so don't expect quiet window-shopping session. Prices are heavily overpriced compared to EUR or US so don't leave your shoppings here. And you might want to consider your meals here, sandwiches start from 14eur/$20 as is in the city you can get whole meal in half the price.... Constructions are maybe ready in couple of years, at the moment the hotel is only one that's ready, if you have seen the views from hotel's around they are all computer images, there are dozens of bulldozers and machines working as I write this...Casino was also big disappointment, you could call it a massive meat-packing hall with slot machines... No style at all, just a big hall with everything gathered around. And don't expect drinks to be found easily, there are like 4 girls who take orders and even then you have to pay $10 for beer. And talking about no style the hotel's main entrance is like huge train station, you could expect something else from a hotel like this...In general I could recommend this one but just because the rooftop pool area and views from the hotel (city view) are magnificent and you don't need to stay at hotel so much, Singapore has so much else to offer...",172
MBS,3,“Less would be more”,"Spent 3 nights there during a business trip. The size and everything related to it is really impressive, the location provides an awesome view to the city and to the sea and the skypark is for sure something you gotta see when you're in Singapore (even though they charge non-hotel guests to get up there). However, the whole complex is a bit too fancy and much too big for me. There's nothing really personal to it, service and staff is just average and some things didn't work properly (e.g. room phones). The architecture of the whole complex is in my point of view not thought through well enough and definitely not something beautiful, neither from inside nor outside.On the bottom line, I would say this hotel is a huge money machine, mainly attracting people with bigger wallets but maybe not such a big sense of taste, class or personality. In Las Vegas, this might fit, but I personally am sad to see more and more things like this showing up in Asia.",94
MBS,1,“Horrendius”,"This place is just plain awful. Such a rip off. The quality of hotels in Singapore is generally so high. Marina Bay Sands has got to be the absolute worst value-for-money in the city. It is huge and jam packs with gawkers and tourists. The staff is overwhelmed and clueless. Check in took half hour! The \skypark\"" with it's pool is impressive but so crowded and cordoned off you really can't enjoy it. I had my pick of hotels and sincerely regret having picked this lousy joint. Next time back to the Grand Hyatt!""",103
MBS,2,“Mediocre experience”,"Very poorly run, on arrival my confirmed room needed 3 hours to be made ready, so I asked for one with two beds, first attempt was too smelly, 2nd attempt on the 9th floor was too noisey due to a large freeway below.Food is massively over priced and do expect to get up out of your chair to ask for a drink, multiple times. Seafood was not fresh, prices beyone Tokyo.Stores carry nothing anyone but a sultan can afford, casino has heavy screening check, basically, not coming back. Pool is cool however, they check the security so many times its almost not fun.",37
MBS,2,“Hotel of luxury that corners the clients in a corner of the swimming pool”,"Due to Chanel's parade one cornered the clients as cattle in a corner.The first day we said that there was a spot of chocolate in the carpet, they did not clean it. And the crystals were dirty",173
MBS,1,“Avoid like the plague!!”,"If you seek a 5 star, value for money, full service experience, avoid this property like the plague!!! If you seek accomodation without ongoing conflict....avoid this like the plague, if you seek a relaxing, stress free arrival, check in, confirmation of booking, queue free breakfast, easy and quick checkout....avoid this property like the plagueThe management of this property need serious leadership to overhaul the chronic problems in the property. People will continue to flock there, driven by the amazing build, design and fit-out however, for value for money, and just plain customer service, be warned, a 1 star property could and is probably doing better. I suggest you read all of the terrible and poor reviews, it is hard not to agree with them, and frankly, those who have posted a positive review, I really consider how contrived or staged these are. The facts are simply overwhelming, incredibly poor service, staff confused and inadequately trained, no front line leadership to address and deal with the problems and so on and soBe warned people.....",230
MBS,3,“Disappointing experience”,"We had an early arrival at the hotel but we were told that our room was ready and we could get into it. When we got into the room, we noticed the cleaning was not completed ( durty carpet, durty cups, lot of hair on the floor......) So, we call to advise and to get proper room cleaning. Someone came to clean the room but after he finished, all the hair were still on the floor and the sticky spots on the carpet were still there. We asked to move to another room but they answer they did not have other room available. (The hotel has more than 2500 rooms!) They just promised they would come again to clean the room. Of course, we had to stay in our room waiting and we stayed there, waiting from 1:30pm till 5 pm and they never came. It cost us 500SGD to stay at this hotel for one night! Then, we were so upset by the situation that wefirmly demanded to be moved to another room. We then get an upgraded room, a free wifi access (which would normally cost $30 a day), free brunch buffet and an extended access to the pool area at the top of the hotel. It was a correct compensation but the problem is that we had to require it, they had never offered anything to apoligize.",327
MBS,1,“Disappointed!”,"That one word sums it up, disappointed. Having stayed in the Macau Venetian I was expecting a similar enjoyable casino hotel experience, but Marina Bay Sands fell well short. The shuttle bus took half an hour just to leave the airport after stopping for a while at terminal 2 & budget terminal. Once we arrived we were off loaded in the basement car park and rounded up like cattle to registration. At registration (at 3pm) they told us there were no rooms to check in to and to come back in 2 hours! So you're telling me I've actually paid over SGD600 to sit in a hotel lobby?? what a joke!When we finally checked into a room it wasn't on an upper floor as what I had paid for, and wasn't worth the money. It was low enough down (15th floor) to hear the road noise of the motorway below. Living in HK we're quite used to road noise, but still disappointing. To their credit after complaining to guest services about the check in process they gave us SGD50 dining credit. The weekend got a little better after visiting the infinity pool. Definitely worth a swim, we went at night and the view was great. Too many tourists wandering around however, felt like a public swimming pool rather than an exclusive hotel.After a swim we visited the casino. Contrary to the website, you have to show your passport, any other photo id is not accepted. It was packed, uncomfortably so, and very smoky. We won a bit on roulette which made the night more exciting. We decided to go for a walk around the shops and to visit the bars at the Pavilions, but as of mid November they weren't finished and neither were the shops or canal, so quite disappointing.Overall, I'm happy we went, as I was looking forward to it, but its not value for money, and its not somewhere we'll be going back to.",66
MBS,3,“spectacular hotel let down by poor service”,"Hotel is new and obviously experiencing teething problems with staff, standard of rooms not as good as other hotels in area.Skypark pool is spectacular service here was excellent but too many non residents were allowed in making it crowded for the guests.Good selection of restaurants in casino area, main hotel restaurant had problem coping with numbers long wait for breakfast unless you were up at 6!",118
MBS,3,“Marina Bay Sands - disappointed reservation arrangement”,"The reservation arrangement is a mass. I made reservation on line and there was package with breakfast and $50 credit for hotel spending. But when I checked in, the frontdesk staff just couldn't find my package. He said he would call me later. OK, but I hadn't received their call that night so that I called them what was going on. But the staff still confirmed me I had no breakfast but could have $50 credit only. I called third times and finally confirmed by a lady. However, when I checked out, the frontdesk still charged me for the breakfast. So even the rest of the hotel is good, you still don't feel good because of this mishandling.",167
MBS,3,“It smelt”,"My husband wanted to spoil and pamper me during our stay in Singapore by finishing off at Marina Bay Sands. The check in was pleasant and they allowed us to check in early..... BUT did not give us the floor or view that we had paid for and we asked to move. They did shift us but we had to wait like 30 minutes ..... No one came to the room and we moved ourselves by going down to the check in again. When we finally got to our room, it looked lovely and spacious but it smelt bad.... We were on the 27th floor and the smell was coming out of the drain holes in the bathroom. The carpets had stains on it and I was surprised as it is a new hotel but the stains were already noticeable.We tried room service and the staff was good. Overall, the only thing I can truly rave about is the view and the wonderful pillows on our bed.",359
MBS,1,“A 5 star disaster”,Recently I have spend two nights at the new Marina Sands in Singapore hotel which I have to say was one of the most disappointing 5 star hotels that I have ever been.With a price tag of $450.00 per night without even a breakfast one has high expectations of this new hotel with its new skypark. After arriving at the Singapore airport I located the shuttle bus and was taken to the hotel. This is a huge building with 3 separate towers and build next to the casino and shopping and entertainment centre.We were dropped in the underground car park entrance. There was no concierge service at all and we had to carry our own luggage up 2 floors across the whole structure which I would say is about 300 meters and line up to wait our turn for check-in. I was given a room at the 7th floor and were told that there were not any available rooms in above floors. I had to carry my own luggage to the room and opening the curtains I was facing the building at the other side of the street. Having booked the room in their web site that boasted that all of their 18 different type of rooms had views I was absolutely shocked. So I went down to the hotel reception and demanded a room with a view. And they gave it to me this time up on the 22nd floor. Again I had to carry my luggage to this room. The hotel staff or security is everywhere telling you that you can not enter here or there than actually serving you. The skypark only opens certain hours of day and as a hotel guest I am allowed to bring one guest with me. Sunday morning wanting a bit of a swim in the pool I was confronted with a barrage of jack hammers determined to spoil your peaceful morning. This hotel has to be the worst in Asia claiming to be a 5 star hotel. Later locals have told me that its just for the gamblers wanting to spend the night with their escorts !!!! what a mistake.,103
MBS,1,“5 Star? More like 1 Star!”,"Too much bad to talk about so have to select a few things. After long queue to check in, arrived at room and it had not been cleaned from previous guest. Many things in the room did not work including electric sockets. Nobody interested in listening to complaints. Tried to speak to duty manager and was told he was too busy to come to me, I should go to him! Emailed complaint was eventually replied to after one week and then was standard reply not taking anything on board seriously. I spend 8 weeks a year in Singapore Hotels but never again here.",293
MBS,2,"“Poor service, too big, bad hotel”","I agree with the other reviewer- the hotel is too big so it looses any personal touches. The \bouncers\"" constantly are checking if you are staying there, and the sky park infinity pool, while a nice view, felt like we were at the zoo with the large groups of the general public walking by and photographing us in the pool. Half the jacuzzis were broken and the pool was dirty- while swimming with googles on the water had paper and plastic floating in it. Reception felt like I was at large convention center with no personal touches, long lines, no where to sit, tons of people and even the people from the hotel could not direct us to the concierge. It is 10 minutes walk from the main city but the concierge could not tell us how to walk there (pleasant across a pedestrian bridge- we found it on our way home). If you want great service, personal touches, and don't want to feel like one of the crowd, don't stay here. Definitely not worth the money, even to swim in the infinity pool.BY the way, if you stay for one day only you can only use the pool while you are checked in your room- you can not use it while you wait for your plane and there is no where to change your clothes if you leave later than checkout. (There was a business person in a suit and they were arguing with him that there was no where he could get out of his business clothes before his 20 hour flight! ) We were done with the pool and hotel before our check out time- we went back to a nice hotel for the remainder of out stay in Singapore.""",232
MBS,2,“Bad Bad Hotel”,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels....But this time, this hotel really takes the prize for BAD BAD (\5 star)\"" HOTELNot only was the hotel service crap:- concierge in my tower constantly harassing me to prove I was a hotel guest, even though I walked by the Concierge 5 minutes ago, 3 times within 1 hour- accused me (via email) of breaking a furniture in the room, even though there was no \""broken vase\"" (or any vase in the room) there to begin with that cost over SG$600 and I didn't see in the room.....- rude and clueless staff telling me to queue in the wrong lines to enter the casino and leave, and then scolded me in public. I want to report the security staff for absolutely appalling service- super calculative fridge that says I will be charged after XX secondsWhat was the deal breaker - was the \""broken vase\"", whereby after follow up my emails and phone calls, the lady staff refused to refer me to the manager, and even though I left my phone number and name down - there was no follow up reply or apology from the hotel.Do not bother. I am absolutely disgusted.I will not recommend this hotel to anyone to stay.This will be the WORST \""5-star\"" hotel I have ever stayed in. EVER.The absolutely crap service killed any experience I have for this hotel""",43
MBS,3,“The Marina Sands is overwhelmed”,The Marina Sands is a beautiful hotel but has big service problems. They simply cannot keep up with their business pace in food service areas. Their apologies are sincere but the price is too high here to receive apologies in stead of service....,135
MBS,2,“Total Waste of Time and Money”,"For the amount of money it cost per night, I expected something special. It was just over crowded with guests from SE Asia (myself being one). I was there as a gift from a friend for 2 nights. I was so looking forward to it but upon arrival.... it's all just hype.The Infinity pool is small (looks huge in the pics) rooms are typical SE Asia Hotel, so boring in fact, I didn't even bother to take any pics!The thing that really got on my nerves was the number of people there! The lobby even at 11pm was 3 deep waiting to check in. The breakfast was even worse, who has ever had to wait 15mins in a queue to be seated for breakfast at a 5*Hotel???look travellers, just save your money and go elsewhere.",71

Like an ant farm with people crawling all over each other.5. Service. So bad, it must make the top 5 twice!This property is an embarrassment to a 3 star hotel chain.",708
MBS,1,“Worse hotel experience in Asia in 21 years”,"I stayed at the hotel in early Nov for five nights. On the day I left I a letter to the GM as below:Dear Madam / dear Sir,I would like to inform you that my stay at your hotel has been the worst experience in any three star hotels and above I have ever stayed at. The worse in my 21 year business career.Here is a brief summary of the key issues -- not all -- that I faced during my horrendous five night stay.<U+F0A7> I had to line up for over 10 minutes to check in the hotel.<U+F0A7> At check-in:o my reservation could not be found; theno my reservation was found to had been cancelled; theno my reservation was found to have been changed; theno my request for a non-smoking room, king-size bed and high floor could not be met; theno a room (non-smoking plus king-size bed) was found but on a law floor (the eighth). I was told I would be informed the next day if a change would be available. I was never informed of any change; theno I was never asked for my business details (address, e-mail etc) which is unique for a hotel of your standing; theno I was never offered a complimentary or four -- payment newspaper as is the practice in the same class hotel; theno I was told that breakfast \should\"" be complimentary and I would be told later. I was never informed; theno I was not told by anyone that the gym is not ready yet and that only a temporary one is available.<U+F0A7> I am sure that you have received many complaints with regards to your coffee shop, but here are mine:o Service at the coffee shop and at the lounge adjacent to the coffee shop is minimal. For example, if one only orders a drink, no snacks or tissues are given unless they are requested.o The breakfast fruit is of poor qualityo The lining up waiting time for breakfast is absolutely ridiculous -- at least 10 minutes.o The hotel does not stick to \""set -- which would -- four -- sets -- table\"" principle, as such when I order a coffee in the morning I had to ask several different waiters. It was the same case when I ordered a beer at a different time; I had to ask several waiters too.<U+F0A7> Top Floor Bar. I understand that the management of this particular outlet is separate from that of the hotel but I believe that the security guards outside the bar and outside the innovators next to the bar are hotel staff -- at least they weren't the same uniform. Mr. Peng, who was the supervisor on the night of the incident should be able to provide further details on what happened on the evening of Tuesday 2nd of November at about 10 PM. I was making a call on my cell phone in a quiet but open area. I was dressed in a suit. I was not speaking loudly. One of the security guards interrupted me several times in a rude manner to tell me to exit the area. Ultimately I did, but the attitude was incredibly rude. Then, I gave one of my name cards to one of the guards because I wanted to speak to the supervisor. I had to wait at least 30 minutes and then I had to ask for the supervisor again as opposed to him looking from me. Only an oral apology was provided. No written note or apology in any other form was provided.<U+F0A7> When I asked for a complaint form or opinion form, I was just told to go to the website but was not provided with any specific instructions. In fact, I was not able to easily find and where to complain or voice an opinion<U+F0A7> when I asked for a check out extension to 2 PM, two days before checking out, someone at the front desk and said they would get back to me but they never did.<U+F0A7> In conclusion, if management has no management skills you should shut down the hotel, we train your staff, and then reopen. Overall, the facilities (except for the gym) are good but the soft skills do not exist.Yours sincerely,""",456
MBS,3,“Hit and Miss”,"Stayed in the Marina Bay Sands recently so I could check out the region and indulge in some 'therapeutic' blackjack and some local cuisine. Booked online a week in advance for a 3 day stay.The hotel runs a concierge at the airport arrivals terminal. I had forgot to print my voucher which was easily remedied by the staff. Moments later, I was on my way to the free shuttle to the hotel.Hotel is massive and beautiful. Location was difficult to get to due to the F1 races at the time.Check-in was a breeze and done in under 10 minutes (this was midweek). I had read the TA reviews and had already prepared myself for the worst. Not so. I was given a room on the 44th floor (what hotel catering to Chinese gamblers has a 44th floor?) with a view of the ocean. Unfortunately, the view was accompanied by a massive construction site. I would have opted for the city view given a second chance.The room was nice enough. Bathroom included all the necessities and more. The bed was comfortable. The big minus was the very expensive internet. At 275 USD a night, internet should easily be included. Of note was the turndown service, which operated in an almost clandestine fashion - I never saw them, although my room was always clean upon my return from a night or day out in the city.The casino is large easy to get to. All who enter have to display their passport (locals are charged a daily fee to enter). Plenty of baccarat tables and slots. Blackjack tables are somewhat hidden towards the rear and start at a lame 35 SGD minimums. Ordering a beer at a table is next to impossible (the waitresses seemed to be severely understaffed) and very expensive. Dealers were pleasant. Live music was also on hand with covers of David Guetta, Akon, and Lady Gaga which contributed to the atmosphere. Despite being a large and attractive casino within 2 hours of me, the overall feel fell well short of the Bellagio/Wynn/MB/Mirage. The gambling experience was lacking, impersonal, and production-line-like. Room service was on point - everything arrived before the '35 minutes' promised by the operator. I highly recommend the Malaysian fare. The nasi lemak and goreng were particularly good. Dined at 'The Nest' in the hotel. Food was hardly anything to write home about. I was surprised by the bitterness of the dishes, but I'm confident this has more to do with regional tastes than anything. In a nutshell, the value just wasn't there. I would consider this hotel again but for only half the original price I paid. And for the gambling - if you're accustomed to American or European gambling, don't bother.",459
MBS,1,“Stop going there!”,"Everybody wants to go to the Marina Bay Sands. Nobody reads the reviews. I was so curious, I ignored those terrible reviews too. What a mistake!Service? Just forget about it. It just does not exist there. If this hotel gets an award, it will be worse service in the World for a 5-star hotel.Cleanliness? Well, a bit like the service. Is it understaffed, I don't know. First night, obviously, someone had slept in our bed. A staff? A guess that was not happy about the room and ask a room change?Next, we had not enough towels for the number of guests. Everyday we had to ask this \extra\"" towel.My girl spilled something on the pillow and the pillow was never changed.A sticker from the airline felt on the floor and was never removed.Room service? Overpriced. I got a burger. No one ever asked how I would like it cooked. So I got a small chunky super-over-cooked burger. My girl ordered a chicken curry. When we realized it was served without rice, we ordered extra rice. We are still waiting for it.After calling for the table to be cleared from our room, we waited patiently for... too long. We finally decided to clear it ourselves and put it in the corridor.The swimming pool at the top floor is... well, a mess. Luckily, it is the world’s largest outdoor pool at that height. But it is NOT the glamorous pool of the website. You will get dirty loungers (The hotel is brand new) and imagine an overcrowded pool with lots of noise. The ambiance is rather the one of a cheap water park than the one of a glamorous hotel.The Ku De Ta restaurant has nothing to do with the famous one in Bali. They only serve ATTITUDE. Hotel guests are reminded that Ku De Ta is independent, so don't complain and go f... yourself.The hotel lobby is at best a large shopping mall with no seat for your family to wait while you queue at the check-in counter.If you go there for a vacation, it will remind you work as you will get the view on the harbor worksite. Yes, they don't guarantee the view but the floor. To see the city view, please come back when there will be no other guests.We had a nice terrace but... oops, no furniture.I could carry on like this for half an hour. To make it short, terrible service, very very bad experience. Not worth it. Feels like being in a big factory that makes tons of money but where is the guest satisfaction. All the last reviews are terrible. If you start seeing good ones, it will probably be staff members writing positive reviews. Oh yes, because they are great at marketing.""",102
MBS,1,"“Beautiful from afar, but far from beautiful!!!!!!”","The price is over, the service, room quality is so low to compare with it's charge.

Especially staff skills is so poorrr, during 1 day staying there I didn't see any smile on their face. Sorry I have to say I am really disappointed with this hotel on everything, never come back. Beautiful from afar, but far from beautiful!!!!!!""",621
MBS,1,“Unbelivably horrific - need to review their tag line 'execeed your expectations' - didn't come close.”,"The worst accommodation experience I have ever encountered. After tripping around Indo-China for 12 nights, thought we would treat ourselves to our last 2 nights is this awesome looking hotel. The external architecture is visionary. Free shuttle bus trip from Changi took 1 hour in little traffic (suggest spend the $ and get a cab), no-one to assist any disembarking guests to remove luggage from coach. Driver just sat in her seat. No signage to tell you that there is a check-in desk where the coach pulls up. No evidence of our 2 night booking. Asked if I could access the Internet to print the confirmation from the hotel and gent said I would have to pay to do that! It turned out they had us on the system on the wrong dates.................Business Centre staff member super sweet, helpful and apologetic (didn't pay for printing obviously!!), escorted us to another Reception in Tower 1 to check-in, then down to Tower 3 Reception to complete check-in. Room OK, not opulent, beige and modern, super comfy bed and big plasma, no bath!, Now some of these things I would never mention usually, but when you are paying big bucks and it was a treat for us, they mattered. Only 1 normal tea bag. All the rest were herbal. No UHT or fresh milk, only powdered. Hair dryer cord not long enough to be used in a power outlet near a mirror. Lifts not air-conditioned. Skypark or Business Centre, not labelled on the lift button. Typos in the Room compendium and shopping map absent. Maid and Mini-Bar both entered the room when the DND was illuminated.Check-in girl did not know where I could do 'money change'. No restaurants open on pool deck during the day, except for the 'Members Only' one. Staff few and far between to try and arrange a drink, sandwich by pool. Pool awesome and Adults Only pool a great idea and vigilantly enforced, kids can have fun in the other pool or spas, not much shade, gawped at and photographed by all and sundry. Pool deck toilets inacessible, dirty and stinky.Wanted to eat lunch in the Bar - cannot. Got order wrong, never offerred any drinks. 50th floor ws supposed to be Deluxe, view over harbour nice. Friday nights the 'doof doof' music from the nightclub resonates throughout the upper floors. Had to turn the air con off in the room as all the cigarette smoke was coming in. Female guest with a baby complaining of this the next morning at Reception. She was on level 51. Could hear the guests next door running water and flushing the toilet.TV system failed to work throughout the entire hotel on the last day so queue at check-out monstrous. No queue management. It is the most I have ever paid per night out of my own pocket to stay in a hotel and we were devestated at how poor everything was. I handwrote a letter of complaint on the first day detailing our issues, attentioned it to the Duty Manager, handed it to Front Desk and never heard a word from the hotel during our whole stay. Think property is aimed at conference guests and casino gamblers.Armies of beautifully groomed staff stand around doing nothing. They look like nervous rabbits. By the time we checked out no-one had smiled, said good morning, how was you stay, happy honeymoon. The exeception was the Bell staff, particularly the fellow who chatted to us while we waited for a cab after we had checked out. He chatted, smiled, made jokes and as he opened the door for us he said 'I hope to see you next time' - we just looked at each other and laughed!",237
MBS,1,"“very bad service, room rates does not match room features”","We checked in at MArina Bay Sands form Nov 2-5 2010. Arrived 3pm. while waiting for our room there was no couch or any seat in the lobby. This is quite weird since they are a very big hotel. ofcourse, a lot of people will be waiting. We booked 3 rooms but when we got there only 2 rooms were availble at the moment they told us that they are still preparing the 3rd room. We called 3x from 6pm onwards to make a follow up on the 3rd room. but still no reply from them. When 10pm came we finally decided to cancel the 3rd room since it will be useless to still use it. Front Desk never left a messge in our room re: the 3rd room.Room is not so imprressive. we usually stay in Four Seasons and St.Regis with the same rate ($500 per night) but room amenintes and service is impeccable. They also did not make up our room and did not remove the plates and utensils from the in room dinning. it took them 48 hours to do it if i have not requested for it.Music of the band playing from the lobby can be heard from our room and thus we did not have a good sleep.the only thing that is nice is the pool. thats it! but take note: the only food you can order are potato chips and combos.",226
MBS,3,“Beautiful but not ready yet”,"Booked a night at the MBS in Singapore to experience this beautiful hotel but did not live up to my expectations.In the first place, the hotel lobby was caotic with so many tourists around just taking pictures; had to queue to check in only to be told that my room was not ready, but it would be in the next two hours! Of course, after two hours of wandering around, I had to go back to reception to demand my room. Once in my room, my luggage took 90 minutes to arrive……Management tried to compensate with a late check out and breakfast, but the experience left a sour taste. And even though I had booked a room with a view on one of the highest floors, it overlooked a construction site and not to the business skyline….On the positive side, the room was acceptable and the pool an enjoyable experience. However, as tourists and visitors are allowed to walk past the pool area taking photos, you feel like a penguin in a zoo….Breakfast quality was OK, but the cafe is in the hotel lobby and it was noisy and chaotic. I guess that it is pretty difficult for a hotel with 2500 rooms to make any guest feel \special\"". Staff were friendly and professional (my complements to Kelvin, duty manager) but many things could be improved….""",336
MBS,3,"“1st class outdoor pool, 2nd class service!”","As the taxi drove up to MBS, you cannot help but be amazed with the hotel building - three very all towers all joined up at the top floor (where the pool is). You could tell that the hotel was very popular as the lobby was full of guests checking in/out. It took us about 20 mins to finally check in - really long queues with too many staff in front of the desks directing but not enough behind the desks.We had booked a Horizon room and were given one on the 26th floor, unfortunately the view from our room was of the building site next to the sea and not of the city. The room itself was big in size and really nicely decorated. Bathroom was huge with a wetroom, big bath and his/hers wash basin. Overall, impressed with the hotel room. Only negative was that the TV wasn't working and the hotel maintenace couldn't fix it when we checked out the next day (quite disappointed considering how new and expensive the hotel is) We then went straight to the top floor for the main attraction - the 150m inifinty outdoor swimming pool. The pool was relatively small due to the high numbers of other pool users. But we didn't care as we were in swimming 200m above ground overlooking Singapore City/marina. You actually feel like swimming in the sky! Breathtaking.However, eveything else was average. The hotel boasts loads of chic and upmarket shops but apart from the stores on the main promanade, most are yet to stil open and the shopping centre itself is half finished with construction still ongoing (foodcourt consists of 3 market stalls!).Overall, it did seem overpriced for what we got as it felt that the hotel/shopping centre isn't 100% finished and the service isn't 1st class.

MBS,3,"“lovely structure, service needs help....”","i read the reviews on traveladvisor so i was a bit apprehensive. Upon arriving, the arrival desk was very ordinary and not really helpful. We were pointed to where the shuttle was to come to and we waited for about 25 minutes only for the shuttle to come by and drive off without stopping at its stop!!!! leaving obvious guests standing.We reported to the desk and were advised to take a taxi...the taxi refused to help us with our luggage much to our surprise.upon arrival at the hotel - no seating or waiting area, we were made to wait in a long queue for almost 30 mins, with things looking quite disorganised.The room was very nice, very modern with functional and classy things.Breakfast was another 30 minute wait on a long long queue.The shopping not yet completed but promises to be very very impressive when it eventually is.overall, the hotel is very impressive but the service lets it down, this could be as a result of its newness or the incomplete nature of the complex as a whole.I have to agree that it should be better in a few months time if the management pays serious attention to the comments by guests.",195
MBS,1,“PLEASE DONT CALL IT 5 STAR!!!”,"1. if you are checking in after the normal check-in time (3.00 pm), please make a note of these things carefully: a) no bellman will be there to take your luggage from your taxi to the check-in desk. b)expect a 30 - 40 minute wait in queue. c) be prepared to understand the english spoken by the staff, who stand like idols and be patient till they check-you in. if you arrive ahead in time of the normal check-in time, god bless you!!!2. after strenuous check-in process, please be kind enough to take your luggages with you, if you still wish to wait for 40 minutes to get your luggage at your room, you may contact a bellman.3. after good night sleep, warm-up your legs to stand in a 20 minute queue to enter the breakfast room. 4. on sunday, be prepared for the housekeeping to come to your room at 3.00 to 4.00 pm. in one line, IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS HOTEL, COME AS A VISITOR, ITS FREE TO SEE AND TAKE PICTURES, for the same money, you will get a hundred time better service at RITZ CARLTON or MANDARIN ORIENTAL singapore.",392
MBS,1,“TITANIC!!!”,"We visited the Sands during my daughter's school break in Oct for a family vacation. Superficially, the hotel looks grand. However, reality catches up with a guest very quickly. Here is a quick litany of the problems that my family suffered during our stay. A lot of things, even basic ones, do not work properly in the rooms. This ranges from design errors to poor workmanship to poor maintenance. For example, the AC in our children's room did not work. In order to restart the unit, the engineer would open the sliding door to the balcony in order to rebalance the air. Still it would stop after 5 minutes. AC is not a luxury in a place like Singapore. Worse yet, the chain lock on the door, which uses an internal mechanism got jammed after latching. As a result, we could not open the door to our children's room, which presents a severe fire hazard. Worst of all, we complained about this to the front desk manager, who promised to look into this personally, but did nothing. When we returned at the end of the day, not only was the chain still jammed, but there was no voice mail or note explaining what if anything was being done. We could only conclude based on this negligence that it was NOTHING.Beyond these problems, the hotel was clearly opened well before it was ready. The staff is not well trained, particularly those involving guest services. There were other nuisances. Everyone knows that this project placed the parent corporation under severe financial strain. It shows in how they nickel and dime you for everything from $30 internet access to $25 charge for accessing their sky level. For what you do receive, there is too much hassle factor, namely the crowds and long queues for everything like breakfast. I could go on about the location being somewhat inconvenient, no turndown service, etc., but I think you get the picture.In short, shame on the Sands, shame on Singapore, and be warned about making a visit, at least a family one to this hotel unless you do not mind being a guinea pig. Macau is not Las Vegas and Singapore is not Macau. People might come for an exploratory visit, but it is hard to see, based on this level of execution and service, why anyone would return.",294
MBS,1,“World class? More like worst class...”,"After getting off at what appears to be an unloading bay area of a warehouse, we went to the lobby/reception area that looks as though it belongs in a hospital - no plush carpets, no sofas. Some budget hotels have far more impressive lobby areas. The receptionist took ages to check in each guest; we had to wait 45 min in the queue only to be told that our room was not ready yet! We were told earlier that check-out time was 11am and check-in starts from 3pm. It was already 5 pm then. What?? They need 6 hours to clean a room? Ridiculous!We decided to leave our luggage with the hotel front desk and went for dinner. When we returned and got our room at 9pm, we found out that out luggage had not been brought up yet. Worse, one of the cushions is badly stained (see photo)! A call to the concierge took 5 min to get connected. The concierge said they would bring up the luggage but hung up the phone before I finished talking. 30 min later the luggage still did not appear. We made another call to the concierge and was put on hold for 8 minutes before the line was cut off. It was almost 10pm by then; we had no choice but to go down in person to collect our luggage. I spoke to a disgruntled staff member who revealed that the service had been just as bad from day 1. While the hotel room is decent enough, and the view spectacular, the customer service is rotten, certainly not what we would expect from a so-called world-class hotel. I wouldn't even recommend this hotel to my worst enemies! Unless you get a great rate, go elsewhere, people!",215
MBS,3,“A lot to like and a lot to dislike”,"Interesting resort....I booked this resort after admiring the property via their website. Strangely, I hadnt consulted TA reviews before booking, usually I do. I did take a peak after I had booked my accomodation and I was surprised at how inconsistent the ratings were. Whilst being ranked 140th in Singapore is probably acceptable to a mid range property or acceptable to a new resort still finding its feet. Marina Bay Sands service standards are under delivering!So many negative service comments are true, so I wont repeat our incidents, however I can add that we did experience some quality staff interactions, friendly, happy and helpful at times.This impressive hotel, incredible design, exciting and extensive facilities should be ranked up their with the best but doesnt.A long line upon check-in is a frustrating start to your stay. The difficulty of checking out (30min+) trying to sort the final account out was just as frustrating.The rooms were spacious, stylish with spectatular views. We dined at Santi's and Guy Savoys and enjoyed these unique signature dining experiences on offer at Marina Bay Sands.The view from the rooftop pool is as spectacular as the pictures show, in fact breathtaking! I returned to Singapore last week and did not return to Marina Bay Sands. Will I? Maybe when TA reviews improve!",408
MBS,1,“What a ???? Hotel!!!”,"Never seen a hotel with such poor reviews on Tripadvisor. And they're all true! There was no turning back as we had booked before reading all the poor reviews on Tripadvisor. I would have to agree with all these reviews. To put it politely (note the subject), this hotel is rubbish. We booked a Suite and a Horizon Grand Room for the family. This is a brand new hotel so the rooms are so so, standard of a 4 star hotel. The lobby is overcrowded, restaurants and bars are a disgrace and the swimming pool (the resaon why we booked this hotel) is an absolute joke. If you go swimming, you'll feel like an animal in a zoo! With the right management this could be a good 4 star hotel: the hardware is definately worthy of 4 stars but the service is probably the poorest I've ever encountered and believe me, we stayed at a good few hotels.Let's start by checking in: 1. Queued up for 30mins. and were told that the rooms weren't ready yet (it was already 4pm). We were told they should be ready within the hour. 2. An hour gone by and queued up for another 20mins. and were told that only the suite was ready. So we took the suite first and waited for the other room which we were told would be ready within the hour. 3. After 90mins. we queued up for another 10mins (as it was getting late there was less people) and was told that the room was still not ready. No apologies - nothing. After refusing to give in for the third time and demanding to see the manager a room suddenly appears. Now where did this room come from?4. You can calculate the time we checked in to the room.Surprisingly, checking out was the opposite, very efficient in fact. However, there was no service at the front of the hotel (actually, there was no service anywhere in this hotel). I could see doormen, porters and parking valets but was there any help? You guessed it. We were taken to the airport by family living in Singapore and they used the valet parking. We got the car, tipped the man and he walked straight passed me as I was struggling to get our bags into the boot! Now that takes the biscuit!

Now we're waiting to reject this payment, but after long talks and shouting, they charge once more money, that we are had to pay, but the first bill is not still returned! Totally we have paid 2800 dollars for two nights!!!!There are more awful things to say:1. at lobby there are no place to sit.2. queues3. nobody said that dinner is included in our reservation4. no any information about hotel restaraunts in room5. check in in 3 p.m.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!6. no smoking area in hotel!! very away from entrance",364
MBS,1,"“Find another hotel, fast!”","My partner and I try to stay in nice hotels to really enjoy our holiday. In the past, a five star hotel has meant we received five star service, and if this is what we have paid for, it is not unreasonable to expect five service. This was not the case with Marina Bay Sands, we have had better service at three star hotels in country towns. My list of complaints about Marina Bay Sands is long, but I will try to be brief. Problems included: shuttle bus from airport was 20 minutes late, then took a further 15 minutes for driver to get organised and depart; check-in took an hour, with three staff members vanishing when a queue of people arrived; no porter to take luggage to room; shower floor was covered in a dirty greasy film that was only cleaned after we asked twice; no towel rack; concierge could not answer our questions and gave us incorrect information; no shuttle bus service available to city; rudely refused entry to casino as we didn't have passports with us; many restaurants are on map of hotel but are not open yet, we spent over half an hour one evening trying to find somewhere to eat; my partner was shoved aside in the foyer by a staff member escorting a group of people to the elevator; dirty mugs in room; fridge in room was locked as the hotel did not have our credit card details through their own incompetence, we had to sort this problem out ourselves, taking over an hour and a number of phone calls; floor of room not vacuumed at all during our 6 night stay; offensive odour in bathroom every evening, smelt of sewage; items such as sugar and toiletries not replaced until asked for; could hear people in other rooms talking and using bathroom; staff member came into room to check bar fridge as something had been bumped and they were worried that we had used something form the fridge; bill out by $150 on departure (in the hotel's favour). I wrote a letter to the manager but have received no reply (one month later). The pool is great though.",24

MBS,2,“Just another bottom line hotel”,"As a newly established supposed world class hotel, MBS did not meet any expectations. Check in was a 45min queue with no service to assist up to the room. If you are thinking that this is a progressive hotel, that cares for the environment or you, you will be bitterly disappointed. In room amenities are cheap, that contain many harmful chemicals - I would suggest bringing along your own, like we did.We suffered internet outages, long queues, poor service and a miss-charge on our bill to top it off. If your going to stay in Singapore - pick an up market boutique hotel instead that actually cares.",305
MBS,3,“Don't expect too much as you stay in a 5-stars hotel”,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. My husband was so impressed with the advertisement he saw on Singapore Airlines, so he decided to booked in this hotel.Yes, they have the WOW factor for the first impression, the hotel was huge, and they upgraded our room from Atrium Premier to Horizon for free, the room looked fantastic. But during our stay, we find that the staff not well trained. When we first checked in, we were advised that we've got $50 Bonus Credit Daily during our stay, but when the next day we try to confirm it, we spoke to 3 person and they all gave us different answer !! They managed to fix it, but having this experience in a 5-stars hotel which is not cheap is really dissapointing !Also,- Internet is expensive $10/1 hour, $15/6 hour, $30/24 hour .... and you paid $360/night ?- Mini Bar will charged automatically after 30 sec you moved something, so beware when you have little children that love to check everything out !- In Room Dining is overpriced, $20 for 6 pcs chicken wings, $20 for 6 pcs of chicken satay, $25 - Fried Rice, and you still need to pay 16% tax and service charge on top of that- Need taxi to go everywhere, though this hotel has more supply of taxis than any hotel I have ever seen in Singapore- I hardly seen any smiles from the hotel staff, maybe they tired ?- The lobby hotel was too crowded, imagine Changi Airport when you check inI think this hotel still need a lot of improvements, especially their human resources, because when we paid 5 stars hotel rate, of course we expected 5 stars hotel treatment !

Checking-out is a similar experience, followed by another queue waiting for a taxiSGD15/hour for internet in a +SDG500 room?

MBS,2,"“Good for the novelty factor, not much else.”","Let's start with the good. The Infinity Pool at Skypark is an impressive piece of design, so having the chance to swim there might be worth it to some. Rooms are very spacious and new, with nice views. In-room meal service was good, but expensive.The BadOdd drainage systems in the bathrooms, which are incredibly noisy if people in other rooms shower. Also a really strong, bad smell coming from the drains, like they need to be cleaned (although I can't figure out why that would be since the hotel is so new).Price GougingYou'll need to pay S$30 for 24 hours of internet access. $S20 for six hours.Breakfast at Rise is around S$40+, same for in-room mealsPoor Hotel DesignThis would be my main complaint. Not much the hotel can do about it now, but it suffers from a number of poor design choices. The biggest is the lobby, which doesn't have any of the relaxing character of a good 4-star hotel lobby. Picture trying to check in at a kiosk in the middle of a busy mall, and that's pretty much the general feeling. They've recruited a classical stringed quartet comprised of short-skirted ladies in heavy makeup, but the effect is more unsettling than soothing. And because the lobby is so highly trafficked, expect show your room key to the bouncer at the elevator to your room. Suppose this means decent security, but it's just a weird feeling to be questioned for a key every time you want to go back to your room. The taxi queue t near tower 1 is real snarl of cars. The architect inexplicably put the main exit for the basement carpark right next to the entrance, so even if you manage to get a taxi, expect to wait a while before you can actually get out of there. There is another, quieter taxi queue near tower three which is highly recommended. For breakfast, give the restaurants a miss and do in-room service. The lines in the morning are incredibly long, and service isn't so great. The staff are real efficient with getting the bill to you, but you have to get real aggressive to get any coffee or tea from the wait staff. There are plenty of them but they spend most of the time talking to one another. I've had to stay here for 6 nights, which is a bit rough. Staying for a night might be worth it for the novelty factor, but otherwise, stay somewhere else until they get their act together.",73
MBS,1,"“Amazing architecture, however the service leaves a lot to be desired”","The hotel is still having major teething problems, which seems inexcusable as they are still charging S$ 500+ (£250+) for basic rooms per night. Fundamental hotel services are still not working i.e. my room had not been cleaned when I arrived. I stayed for 1 week because of a conference, however next time I come to Singapore I will definitely stay somewhere else. I reccomed strongly that you avoid this hotel if possible.",208
MBS,2,“Absolutely horrible service”,"I agree with a lot of the reviewers that the place has horrible service and is definitely overpriced. The lobby is full of people with no fixed queue and when we finally got to the counter, the receptionst was very inexperienced and took a long time to check in. My room faced the construction side so when I head out the bare balcony (not even a chair), the noise was very loud. The worse part was breakfast. Although I didn't wait too long to get in, service was terrible. I had to clear my plates out of the table as there weren't enough waiters to do the job. I got some vegetables and to my horror, found out there were dead worms inside. When I asked the waitress to refill my tea and then ask for toothpicks, she asked if I needed anything else; when I reply no, she said, \Good\""! All employees have this really unfriendly face, have not seen one friendly smile. Internet usage would also cost you an extra S$15 an hour, which is quite ridiculous for a 5 star hotel. The pool and the roof is great though, spectacular views and plenty of towels. But now that I've seen it, I'm not going back.""",151
MBS,2,“More hype than substance.”,"The hotel lobby is like a fishmarket with all the hordes of tourists and residents. Checked in close to tower one and had to be dragged all the way to tower three for a check in. The room although hi tech was tacky and rough on the edges. Breakfast was only obtainable after a long queue which was also ridicolously positioned close to the entrance at tower one. They would have been better off assigning each tower with its own restaurants and services. Check out was like going through immigration with a wait of over 40 minutes, as there was clearly not enough staff to man the numerous counters! The best part of the trip was the sky garden with its infinity pool looking out onto the city. Now that I have ticked this experience in box, I never intend going back. Im shocked that Singapore would allow such an inefficiency!",299
MBS,3,"“Grand, New but to be avoided”","If you like grand and new this is your place but if you want service, a pleasant stay and not feel like part of a huge cattle herd then avoid it. It's not worth the money. The good first. It's new and the rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. Low floors facing the Ocean are noisy by the freeway and not so nice. Nice beds, linen, towels and nice large TV. The bad starts from the second you arrive. The foyers, taxi stand area, reception area, valet parking are totally out of control and chaotic to say the least. I was shocked at how bad it was. The check in is also chaos. No fixed queue so people moving and queue jumping all over the place. The staff didn't care at all. After a 30 minute wait and a cold apology they checked me in and I didn't get the room I booked.A visit to the top floor where the pool is is also chaotic. It's like a theme park with hundreds of people cramming the pool area taking photos. Not pleasant at all. Grand and new but very unpleasant.The breakfast queue was totally ridiculous. Over 100 people in the queue to wait to get a table and if you've paid for breakfast you have no choice. We didn't wait and found the nearest Starbucks. The staff are busy but totally unfriendly. The foyer area is like a train station jammed with people making the place appear cheap and uncomfortable.Overall this is not a pleasant 5 star experience and for what you pay I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere. If you like new and grand and don't care about quality then this is your place. I've been extremely disappointed twice now and I certainly won't go again.",126
MBS,1,“Overrated & Overpriced”,"Very disappointed - took my teenage daughters for a surprise trip to find we were staying in a shopping mall (and not a good one at that). The rooms were good, and the pool fantastic - however there was building work going on all through the day; so no chance to relax around the pool.Feel there should be some 'exclusivity' when paying that huge amount of money - you should not be surrounded by coach tripperss, with their plastic shopping bags and McDonalds happy meals.Restaurant was full at breakfast, so had to walk through the shopping mall, for a fair distance to be seated in the conference centre, where the service and food was very poor.Definitely won't be returning,or recommending - in fact quite the opposite.",735
MBS,1,“Budget Hotel in Singapore”,"Having been a member on Trip Advisor for a couple of years now this is the first time I have posted a review. This hotel is the most appalling hotel experience I have had in more than 30 years travelling experience. We made the reservation based on the assumption, mistakenly so, that being the latest and ‘greatest’ hotel in Singapore it would far outweigh the comfort and luxury of the likes of the Ritz Carlton which was the last hotel I stayed in when in Singapore. Indeed the experience we had can be categorised as nothing more than a nightmare. We were at the end of a 23 day holiday where we had travelled around the globe dropping in at Las Vegas, Noosa Heads – Queensland, Sydney, Langkawi and finally Singapore. Frankly the experience ruined the last few days of our holiday! Problems started from the moment we tried to make the reservation online. Their service failed and we were advised to call the telephone booking service to sort the problem. Rather than be helpful they directed that we merely send an email. Having carried out their instructions a further attempt to make the reservation on line succeeded; however, this time, being less than five minutes from the failed attempt, the rate had gone up and the final account was increased by hotel tax and GST, there is no mention of this on their booking site. Needless to say when a copy of the booking was forwarded to them and an explanation sought – it was ignored. Having checked in, which was an interesting experience as there was no bellman to deal with our luggage; we found the room to have a spectacular view of the city. Although this was blighted by the filthy windows – yes inside – they were covered in hand prints! Additionally the room was furnished with sub-standard furniture, essentially it was more ‘budget’ than Five Star. As we had booked a Club Suite we expected the usual refinements to be in the room IE flowers fresh fruit etc., – none of it! In fact the lack of object ‘art was staggering – there just wasn’t one piece! Calling for the management to attend and explain just why the room was so poorly presented resulted in an immediate upgrade. We thought that this was a positive move until we actually arrived in the new suite! It was so sparsely furnished it looked as if someone had either stolen the furniture and or effects, alternatively it looked as if they had stopped furnishing it less than half way! The Front of House manager who dealt with the initial complaint about the standard of the first accommodation promised he was address all the other matters. Furthermore he assured us that he would also address any other issue we had. We addressed a plethora of issues and matters by email only to be ignored. When finally, after several reminders had been sent, he responded he indicated that he would address all matters on the 15th a day after we would have left! This statement lead us to escalate the matter to the general manager. However it turned out that the general manager was off site for a few days. The case was taken up by a Senior Manager – there is little point in going into detail here about how the matter was handled other than to say that it was far from satisfactory and the degree of arrogance displayed when trying to settle the matter beggars belief. Having refused their offers they still applied them when we checked out! In summary when we booked this hotel we expected to find a hotel akin to the Burj al Arab – making such an assumption was a huge mistake. What we found was a basic budget hotel, albeit it had the most amazing rooftop infinity pool, the standard of the accommodation was appalling as was the way in which management handled matters if, indeed, they didn’t just ignore us! What you will find is that several of the staff will try and help although they have no back up or support. What you will also find is;-There is no Club LoungeThe Theatre is not openThe Spa is not openThe gym is not open – although two bedrooms have been made into temporary facilitiesThere are workmen on site And many other facilities just do not exist",266
MBS,1,“Uncommonly horrifying service”,"Here is a recap of our nightmarish check-in experience:1) The scenario we arrived at ard 2pm: the lobby was littered with groups of people standing around with their luggage at their feet.2) The \official\"" check-in time is 3pm. At 3pm, we were told to wait another \""1-2hrs\"" for a room. 3) The Front Desk manager, Mr B.O. was extremely rude & unhelpful: among other comments, \""As you can see, you're not the only one waiting to check-in.\""4) No offer to keep our luggage in a holding room - we had had to speak to another manager for our \""request\"".5) No offer of consolation or compensation for the terrible check-in experience - in fact, we had to 'debate' our way for 10 mins to get a late check-out. 6) We got our room keys at 5.15pm, despite informing them that our firm event at the Sands Convention Centre was scheduled at 5.30pm and we need time to prep.Room Service:1) Our first request for extra blankets and pillows were denied. No explanations.2) We called again after 10 minutes or so. Waited 20 minutes for the pillows & blankets to arrive.Maybe I got it wrong thinking that Sands is a 5-star hotel. The hotel front desk staff simply have no direction and no idea on how to treat guests. My colleagues and I were utterly disgusted by their 'service'. We don't see any point in holding our events at Sands since the hotel will only embarrass our clients in turn. If you really must stay at the Sands, do it just for the pool. and remember to expect nothing.""",41
MBS,3,“Overpriced”,"I stayed there one night on a week-end.Very long check-in (very surprising for such kind of hotel) on Saturday afternoon.Pool is completely over-crowded, except between 7/7.30 AM Sunday morning.Room was very nice.To sum up : too expensive for the overall experience",95
MBS,2,“Not yet a professional”,"The best casino in Singapore, well in Singapore just got only 2 casinos and here in MBS is better than RWS but the staffs services need a lot of improvements.

MBS,1,“DId I stepped into a 3 star hotel?!”,"Stayed 2 nights for birthday celebration, was given a unforgettable one.No free parking for in-house guest.1) No self parking for in-house guest at the hotel (u have to park at the casino/convention area if you would want to pay only $6 PER entry.2) Valet parking available only at the hotel for $12 per 24 hours for in-house guest. Unlimited entries subjected to availability. So even if you are a in-house guest, you are not guaranteed for a parking space.3) Valet parking could not locate our car in their system and time was wasted.4) Tower 1 Lobby driveway was in a chaos, cars and taxis puling into the driveway together creating a massive mess.No indication of check-in and check-out counter1) No signs, no dividers between queues. Everyone was just surrounding the counters trying to check-in.2) Check-in took close to 20mins. Without confirming room rates/credit card on hold, credit card was charged.3) Check-out at 12pm took more than 30 mins with only 4 in queue infront of me.Room1) Tower 1 low level room was first given. Faulty aircon, curtain unable to be drawn, sink choke, lights faulty. Was told a 2 hours wait was needed to move to another room. Requested for a immediate room change instead and was upgraded to Tower 2 high level.2) Upgraded room, all was fine except the door bell was not working. Every time we had to call housekeeping, they had to call the room to get us to open the door. Staff insisted we had the \Do Not Disturb\"" turned on.3) Internet was at an astonishing $15 per hour, no free access which was a surprise for a 5 star. Probably due to the lower room rate we paid.4) Mini bar had a 30 second rule, anything removed from it outside 30 secs would be charged. Small prints on the door.5) The bed was very comfortable. The one thing that laid a smile on our faces.6) City view was great. The second thing that left a smile.7) Both room cards were disabled on second day after we came back from lunch. A staff by the name of Sebastian in the front office told me that he could not explain why was it disabled and blamed it on the card sensitivity. No words of apologies.8) No newspapersSecurity / SkyPark1) Security at lift lobby randomly checked room cards for room access. 2) Same for access to SkyPark. Security did random checks and seemed to have double standards. One time, we were told 3 guests with room cards are allowed. Second round, 8 of us managed to go up without being asked for room cards.3) Nice view in the SkyPark without a doubt.4) No privacy for hotel guests in the pool. Guests swimming were like exhibits. Non in-house guests who paid $20 to the SkyPark could walk freely behind the pool.In short:Terrible managementTerrible customer service handlingTerrible knowledgeNo smilesOverpriced""",339
MBS,2,“There are better hotels in Singapore”,"Stayed 2 nights here and 3 nights at Swissotel The Stamford. The only reason to stay here is to have a swim in the Skypark pool, which is spectacular - Dubai eat your heart out! You can pay to have a look around the Skypark, but it seems you can only swim if staying at the hotel (or visiting a guest).Got in several hours before check-in time (no queues at around 8am) so we were given a higher level (49th floor) room that was available immediately, but with twin beds rather than King. Happy to accept as we just wanted to have a nap. However, other colleagues got upgraded to better rooms (separate bath, free internet) in Tower 2 (which seems to have direct access to the pool area without having to go through security like Tower 1 & 3 guests). Note there are check-in/out counters at either end of the hotel at Towers 1 & 3, with the larger one at Tower 1.Positives; Skypark access, fresh new rooms (but still not nearly as good as a standard room at Grand Hyatt Macau), just across the road from MBS convention centre [but I would recommend staying elsewhere around Marina Bay (Pan Pacific, Conrad, Mandarin Oriental, etc) or near Swissotel The Stamford (Raffles, Carlton, etc) and catch a bus, which are air-conditioned].Negatives; no free internet (you're paying enough already for a 5 star hotel), no newspaper, no airline Frequent Flyer affiliations (only the MBS premier advantage program), incredibly poor breakfast option details (opening times of the various restaurants given, but no indication of range and price of breakfast offered in either the room hotel directory or on the TV hotel information channel - and at the moment there's only really one cafe option around 7am in the shopping mall across the road), unhelpful senior staff when there was cause to contact them.By all means stay 1 or 2 nights to have the Skypark experience, but unless your company is paying for you, there's better value and service elsewhere in Singapore.",672
MBS,1,“City bling and stress - a huge hub unable to cope”,"This landmark hotel is certainly an impressive sight, both on the skyline and on arrival in the lobby. But any time spent there quickly reveals a management under stress and staff unable to cope with inadequate and badly thought-through facilities. What promises comfort and glamour delivers an experience that reminds you you're just a cog in a vast money-making machine.The hotel is designed to impress at first glimpse rather than to promote anything like relaxation: booking in and staying there was so stressful that I and my colleague booked out early the next morning with out even 'enjoying' breakfast (see below for why!). With so many things wrong, it's hard to choose, but three areas stand out - 1: the big sell, their rooftop infinity pool; 2: service and complaints procedures; 3: breakfast facilities.Pool:The rooftop infinity pool is the hotel's top attraction and has amazing views - but also three downsides:a) day visitors stand around at the back (right behind you if you're on the sunloungers) snapping away at the views - bad news for the self-consciousb) the pool is subdivided into smaller pools by underwater 'walls' so you can't swim more than a few metres. It's too crowded and shallow anyway (4ft).c) From tower 2 there is no direct access - you have to go all the way down in the lift in your dressing gown, cross to another lift and ascend to the 54th floor.So what looks like one thing - the boutique infinity pool vibe - turns out to feel more like a crowded lido. Excellent for a one-off, or if you're a day-tripper up there (the views really are something), but not somewhere you feel like returning to in order to relax.2: Service managementHaving booked a sea view room and been given a city view, we were dumped in another room temporarily while things were sorted out.. and just left there. The room smelt of smoke and there were cigarette butts on the balcony. Here's the worst bit: trying to contact front desk, I was kept on hold for fifteen minutes, listening to lift music. This happened three times so was not just bad luck. When I finally decided to complain to the duty manager, front of house staff would not put me through - that is, they put me through repeatedly to 'someone else' who had no authority, and who would not identify themselves unless challenged. For all the staff's perfect manners, this strikes me as a management system reacting badly under extreme pressure. On our way out, a porter hinted that we weren't by any means the first to leave early - capacity was too high for as yet untested facilities. A pity management weren't listening to him. Which leads us to the third big problem........3: Breakfast. If queueing for over an hour for a lobby breakfast is your idea of luxury, you're booking the right place. And that's a big understatement: when I and my colleague finally checked out in disgust at midday, there were still people queueing up to eat. Again, staff confided that the facilities simply weren't adequate for the numbers - but why? Can't hotel designers count? So doesn't Marina Bay have anything going for the traveller? Well, yes.. As a glamorous location stuffed to the gills with designers shops and casinos and top restaurants, the Marina Bay Sands experience is worth a single night of your life - if you're not in search of a romantic or relaxing location.that is. My tips: a) Book without a breakfast deal. b) Take a room in tower 1 or 3 for direct pool access. c) Get there early - 3pm is check-in - head for the rooftop pool and enjoy sunset. Then troll around the designer shops and casino or whatever, enjoy the room, and perhaps a 7am swim as the city wakes below... and d) - get the heck out of there! Believe me, you'll really appreciate a calm, simple, well-run city hotel after this. And luckily for you, Singapore's full of them.",897
MBS,3,“SkyPark is the be all and end all of this hotel”,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at one of their Club Rooms. At SGD 548 (including GST and VAT), it came with access to the SkyPark and its pool and lounge bar). It also included buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and canapes, all at the Fuse Lounge since the Club Room is still under construction. They let you borrow iPads there as well as read local newspapers. There was also unlimited internet access in the rooms. The room was big and spacious so much so that it looked sparsely furnished and decorated. Nonetheless, it was very comfortable. However, it could not hold a candle to the rooms at Venetian Macao. The bathroom was equipped with hair dryer, magnified mirror which could be plugged in, and toiletries. The closet held 2 waffle cotton bathrobes, 2 pairs of slippers, 2 umbrellas, an iron and ironing board, and a flashlight. There was an in-room safe, electric kettle, Nespresso and coffee machine (which we did not use for fear of being charged), and a mini fridge full beverages. The last of which exhibited the extreme paranoia of the hotel for it had a sign which indicated that any item taken off its place for more than 30 seconds will be immediately charged to the bill. Housekeeping provided 2 bottles of mineral water per day, regardless if the previous day's bottles were opened/drank or not.While I was reviewing the amenities of the Club Room and comparing it against the other rooms (non-suites), I noticed that the latter did not indicate it had hair dryer and toiletries. If they didn't have these, it would have been very odd considering they are a 5-star hotel and these are standard amenities in most hotels.Pros:- Excellent view and pool at the SkyPark. This made our stay worthwhile. Without this, I'd probably be writing a mostly mediocre review- King size bed and down pillows were very comfortable- Free airport shuttle to and from hotel which left every half hour- You can leave your luggage at the front desk for freeCons:- Construction ongoing at the SkyPark distracted from the relaxing ambiance. - At several parts of the hotel, guests are asked to flash their room card keys as evidence that they are in fact hotel guests. This is done when you go to the elevators for each of the Towers, upon exit at 55/F to transfer to the elevator going to the SkyPark, upon entry at the SkyPark, a few meters from the entrance just before you enter behind the pool area, and when you enter the pool area itself. This is because non-hotel guests can go up to the SkyPark for a fee. They are restricted from using the pool but they can still hang out at the corridor behind the pool area.- Some parts of the hotel (i.e. pool, elevator) had noticeable wear and tear already. Perhaps they were evidence that the construction of the hotel was too rushed for the contractors to be meticulous.- Disorganised queue at check in and check out. There is no single queue. Anybody can queue behind anybody already being entertained by staff. This does not ensure that the first person gets served.- Food in buffet breakfast, room service, or cocktail hour was good but not spectacular. They don't vary the food served daily during breakfast. The queue to get eggs cooked takes some time as only 1 person is doing it.- The Club Room came with a nightly turn down service which oddly enough we only received on the 1st night and not on the 2nd.- Cleaning staff arrived while we were out eating breakfast (10am). Given that we had checked in at 3pm only and have not even taken a bath, there was not much to clean up. Moreover, we were left with a used bathroom and used towels until the next day when we checked out.- The Marina Bay MRT station is too far to walk back to the hotel. The directions to the bus stop are too confusing. We wasted an hour walking around moving from 1 bus stop to another. In the end, we gave up and walked back to the hotel with a limp.Suggestions:- Get a view facing the city. It is breathtaking at night when the river and various establishments (i.e Fullerton Hotel, Esplanade) are lit up.- Opt for a room at Tower 1 or 3. If you stay at Tower 2, you need to transfer elevators at the 55th floor to get to the 57th floor where the SkyPark is.- Do not eat at the food vendors at the basement of Marina Bay Shoppes. How can they sell worse food in measly portions for twice the price (and size) at the hawkers?!- Do not give tips (credit card or cash) when you order at the SkyPark lounge. One of the staff told us they don't get it anyway. I feel sorry for them and only infuriated me further.- Take advantage of the free bottle of mineral water. Bottled/imported beverages are almost as expensive as meals at hawker vendors.- Sunset is at 6:30 to 7pm. Go up to the SkyPark around that time to enjoy the Golden hour.- The SkyPark lounge is not such a good vantage point to take pictures. The glass walls get in the way of taking a good picture but it does keep you safe.",60
MBS,3,“pool is great - rest is poor value”,A disappointing end to our trip to the far east - other 5 star hotels gave better service and offered better value.Facilites were good - particularly the spectacular pool but high prices take the edge off itCheck-in and check-out had queues and the carpark/taxirank were chaotic and poorly designedSignage poor and all the atmosphere of an airport terminal (not Changi!),297
MBS,2,“Poor is understatement”,"Went to MBS with wife and two young kids. I was very dissapointed with this so-called 5 star hotel cause it sure feels like 3 star to me. Here are some of my comments:-1. Room - Tidy and neat and thats it! Nothing to 'wow' about and certainly expect more. They don't even have bathtub in the room. It has really been a while since I last stay in a hotel of such standard.2. Service - Where do I even begin?? For one, the staff here are very unfriendly, they hardly smile at you and everything is communicated to you in icy tone. Information gathering is also poor. For example, i drove and self-parked in the convention and casino building. It seems that only have to pay $6 for 24 hours parking, which in my mind is petty since guest should park free, but anyway as I checked out, I try to enquire whether there is a complimantery ticket for me to insert into the exit slot. A concierge who is a PRC and can hardly speak English just look at me and give me some incoherent answer. My patience gets the better of me and I simply walked away. I ended paying $26 for parking.3. Location - So close yet so far away is most apt here. Suntec and Marina Square is not that far but you still need a cab. At least getting a cab here is easy.4. Food - Some saving grace. The breakfast buffet at Rise is ok. Variety wise there are some choices but I still think there is too many people concentrating there and overall not the most relaxing breakfast experience to start your day.5. Overall Experience - Would not recommend anyone to stay there. Better hotels around the marina area.",341
MBS,2,“Like a 2 star tourist hotel dressed up in a fake Gucci dress”,"Ok, fine the pool is great. Spectacular actually. All else fails miserably. I spend 500 SDG on a Club room at the Sands this weekend, and got a hotel stay that I would have expected from a tourist hotel in a medium size Chinese industrial city. Me and my wife have stayed in all but one of the 5 star hotels in Singapore and Marina Bay Sands are by far the worst. In fact, this hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in in Singapore. Everything from the 1 hours check in waiting time ( we still did not get the room we had pre-booked weeks in advance) to the low class toiletries in the bath room, makes this a hotel stay I would like to forget. The pool side menu comprise of twisties from a bag and draft beer in a plastic mug.. No food or drinks are served at the pool side. Now tell me, what other hotel do not serve cocktails by the poolside.Then onto the mini-bar in the room. All items are subject to a sensor, which means if you touch it, you bought it. No chance to put in your own bottle of lets say champagne, or as was the case for my wife and I, the breast milk for our daughter. The breakfast was crowded and not very good. Low quality food and very little choice. Compared to what you get at the Fullerton or the Shangri-la this was beyond bad. So to sum up, if you are going to visit Singapore and you have 400 $ to spend on a hotelroom, stay at the Fullerton, the Four Seasons or even better the pool side Cabanas at the Marriott for far superior service, standard and comfort.After visiting more than a 100 countries, stayed in hundreds of hotels in every continent on the planet, this is the first time I write a review. I have never been so dissapointed with a hotel stay. People who give this hotel a higher rating cannot have travelled much..",316
MBS,2,“A long way to go to 5 *”,"I approached our 3 night stay at MBS with caution having read the previous reviews and was prepared fully to be disappointed. We left with a mixture of feelings about the hotel and in short, it has a long way to go before proving itself to be a 5* hotel. Singapore is well known for good hotels in good locations and MBS is definitely not one of those (although I suspect this may improve once an MRT is closely located and its shopping arcade, Shoppes, fills up). I would recommend for those travellers looking to spend time in the casino or not wanting to do much else apart from stay in a hotel room or a short trip to check out the Skypark which does have great views and is open to visitors. Its location is not the best and the closest MRT is a fair walk away amidst much current construction. The rooms are quite spacious and the service was of such excellence (sarcasm to be noted here) that every day when we put the do not disturb sign, our room was nevertheless miraculously cleaned and tidied but bar fridge was not restocked. Hotel management should take note as we could have claim items to have been stolen/taken while the DND sign was left on and the room still accessed by staff. Room service and FnB was overpriced but not surprised given that there were no other food options nearby. It was also not very appetising to have one's breakfast/meals in the Atrium with a view of dusty footprints along the glass window/ceiling. I am more than prepared to pay for a good hotel experience but MBS has a long way to go compared to other hotels in Singapore and even further compared to the casino hotels in Las Vegas. As one previous reviewer mentioned, it should improve with time .. but how much time?",348
MBS,3,“Not as great as expected”,"Firstly, the hotel is, by Singapore standards, in the \middle of nowhere\"". The closest MRT station is really quite a distance, and the hotel is only practicably accessible by car or cab. By connectivity standards of other hotels in Singapore, I feel this is a rather major let-down.The check-in counter is located in Tower One, which is in one end of a rather long walk of a hotel. We were placed in Tower Three, and found the significant walk to and fro the convention centre rather tiring.Unwinding by the pool, which is located right at the top of the hotel in the Sky Park, was a rather uncomfortable affair as well. The view was as amazing as all the brochures promised, but what the brochures did not mention was that the pool is located along the area of the SkyPark open to the public for the fee of SGD20! It was more than a little uncomfortable to be swimming in your bikini and lounging in the sun when a group of little old people in hats are sitting on benches facing you, trying to enjoy the skyline as well.The rooms were clean and spacious, but there were a lot of things \""available for extra charge\"" that made me feel weirdly conscious about enjoying the facilities. No bathtub available in the Deluxe Room, but the bed was comfortable with fantastic pillows. However, my Tower 3, 9th floor room faced the highway which runs just outside the hotel, and during peak hours it was almost impossible to get any rest!The breakfast buffet was really good, but go early or be prepared to wait in a long queue if you attempt breakfast later than 9am.Service was... perfunctory, ie. very efficient, but not the friendliest. At times, the hotel seemed to just be overrun by either people in suits (business meetings) or Chinese tourists on vacation at the integrated casino.I would recommend this hotel only to those intending to go for a casino vacation. There are far better hotels in Singapore to stay at for the rates the Marina Bay Sands charges.""",71
MBS,1,“Disgraceful”,I there was an industry award for rudeness this hotel's staff would win. All the previous comments about poor fittings and incredibly long waits for service are correct. It's interesting to note that on tripadvisor almost all the positive comments come from travellers that have posted only one contribution. It would be disappointing if the only way this hotel can get good reviews is to do it's own submissions to tripadvisor.,90
MBS,2,“Overpriced n poor service”,"They \lost\"" my luggage for 6 hours and I had to physically inspect the storage areas.Booked an upgraded room with breakfast n free internet but this was not updated on the system until I showed the confirmation.Not enough places n seats for breakfast with long queue everywhere. Breakfast was no fun. Room not well designed - a kingsize bed leave narrow gap to walk, power points are hidden below tables and difficult to reach, sink stuck, toilet floor slippery, etc.Definitely overpriced at S400 per night and at best 3 star.""",637
MBS,1,"“Is 1 star the min? I can really give it 0.5, or less!”","Check in was prompt and efficient and I experienced excellent service from Miss Rebecca, the front office staff who had attended to me. My reserved room type was not updated in the reservation system until I show her the email(between me and the reservations team) that I printed out and she promptly help me change to the room type that I wanted. Very efficient and friendly!I stayed in an Horizon Grand room with the Marina Bay view. My room wasn't done up properly when I first went in. The bed sheets are quite crumpled and there is even a plastic takeaway bowl of unfinished Cheng Tng left behind by the previous guest in the fridge. The postcard had a message written by another guest and was still in the folder. Sound insulation was not good as I can hear the guests next door when they were in their room. The bed and sofa were very comfortable though, all the equipments were very easy to use with simple-to-understand instructions.I visited the SkyPark in the late afternoon, and ALL the staff I've encountered at the SkyPark look very stern and unfriendly, and they all talk to people in a very unhappy and unfriendly tone, as if everyone owes them a living. Some parts of the SkyPark are restricted to hotel guests only and when people want to enter, the staff will ask to see their room key in a very unfriendly tone and just wave them past in a very condescending manner when hotel guests show them the keys. I mean, people paid good money to stay in MBS, I think basic courtesy (like a smile, or thank you) is not too much to ask for, especially in the service line! Even the lady that I order my drink from in the SkyPark just leaned on the wall as I approached her and hand me the menu with a 'crooked' hand when I asked for it. It's really abhorring, just thinking about the service of ALL, and I really mean ALL the staff I saw at SkyPark. Something is really wrong here, the only things right here are the infinity pool and the view, that's all.At night I requested for a bucket of ice, it took about 1hr and two calls before it arrive, enough said. Didn't visit the casino so couldn't review.The next morning I was supposed to go to Rise Restaurant for breakfast but the queue was too long, hence I was directed to one of their convention hall CORRIDOR for breakfast, which is euthanasically called \Bayview Breakfast\"" as the space is facing the Marina Bay. Queue was just as long, if not longer and food was very very mediocre. I mean, if MBS knows how many rooms it has, it should design its breakfast cafe/restaurant so that it can accomodate to the influx of guests in the morning! Simple logic?? Extremely disappointed.Check out was hassle-free, just fill in a form, drop into a box and leave, that's all. However getting the car back from valet was not very efficient. The valet took about 30mins to retrieve my car, maybe that waiting time needs some improvement, especially if there is another appointment to be met by the departing guest.Overall, I feel that MBS can hardly justify the price that it is charging for the level of service and F&B it is providing. I've only had the very \""basic package\"" of room and breakfast and I already had so much bad experience, really cannot imagine what else I'll experience if I'd stayed longer and requested for more things! The only saving grace that the hotel has maybe is the view from the top as well as nice interior decorations, but how far can these bring you? Or maybe....they're just interested in making sure their Casino do well, period.""",744
MBS,3,“Oustanding gorgeous hotel but very expensive for any extras.”,"The most beautiful hotel, loved the spacious room and bathroom. Very comfortable beds and quality furniture after all it is a brand new hotel. Only downsides are that don't expect them to do your laundry washing here (as there is no facilities to do it yourself) approx $4 singapore dollars to wash 1 hanky-----let alone shirts were about $20 singapore dollars approx without ironing it. Far too expensive for sure. The restaurants there are very expensive and when we did splurge out and have the buffet meal one night it cost $68 singapore dollars they told us when we walked in but failed to tell us that there was an extra 10% surcharge (legal tip for staff) and 7% GST on top of this already huge price which we were outraged at, we should have been told when they told us about the $68 SD each charge but what can you do you have to pay it. Be careful too they were going around with a drinks trolly table to table with all sorts of wines on it asking if you wanted a glass (which we assumed was included in the $68 SGD charge each as they did not tell us it was additional and did not write down our table no. or anything but rest assured when we got our bill there it was a $16 SGD charge + 17% for one glass of wine - you heard me 1 glass of wine. This hotel building adjoins the casino by very very expensive shops along the way that are all out of reach of a normal person like me, no cheap shops and hardly any food outlets, basically no fast food outlets close by at all just some expensive restaurants. I guess only the most expensive shops can afford to be in this building. We found that the taxis are so cheap in Singapore and used them to go most places. Even a 20 minute trip away to a tourist attraction chairlift facility to go over to Sentona Island only cost us $6.80 singapore dollars, taxis are very cheap (except watch out for the peak hour surcharge that is automatically added at the end of the trip that we were not aware of - but still makes taxis cheap). We got them to go eat in the city at the food outlets in the shopping centre not far away and or in city as the food there is very cheap and very good and high quality at restaurants and at fast food outlets and quite large meals too. Recommend eating anywhere but Marina Bay sands. The hop on and hop off bus tours are a wonderful way to see the city and learn about it, take you most places. This hotel is a good distance from airport at least 20 minutes if not peak times. The top floor of this Marina bay Sands must be seen it is the best view and the swimming pool facilities are amazing. The Singapore Eye is not too far away at all and could walk but traffic is chaotic when crossing the bridge reco. just take a taxi as it is cheap anyway. Must go on this. All tourist attractions are very cheap to get into in Singapore. Internet is not free surprisingly for a hotel of this standard. Every other hotel I ever stay at is free WIFI. They charged me $10.80 for 10 minutes S.D What a rip off. We paid $28 for a hamburger meal with chips and was a very good meal ordered through room service and a can of coke $8 + taxes SGD etc (as it was very late at nirght and too late to catch a taxi into town to eat). So room service is very expensive but we did know what we were up for total when ordered I made sure of that. But the meal was outstanding but it had want to be for the price hey. Buffet breakfast was included with our room and was outstanding but just to pay for it later when you get there was very expensive if not included with your room charge.In short the hotel is beautiful but they get you with so many extra charges for anything there which is a shame as we paid about $450 Australian dollars a night as a real treat on our holiday but was not happy with all the other extra charges there for everything.",273
MBS,2,"“First world price, third world service”","This hotel apparently sees itself as in a war with its guests to extract as much money from them as possible and provide as little as possible in return. Example 1: my package provided for a 3pm check out. When I asked for it, I was told it was not possible. Why not, I asked, are you full tomorrow? Oh, we not full, I was told, but we never give 3pm check out. Oh, I see. I paid for it, but you just refuse to give it to me. Example 2: the internet service is the worst I have ever encountered anywhere, hands down. A hovel in the jungles of Laos would beat the speed without breaking a sweat, and they apparently use a proxy which blocks popular sites like Twitter to reduce bandwidth use. They do not, however, reduce what they charge you for the service, just what you get in return.Example 3: the a/c can be set as low as 17 degrees, but -- according to the engineer -- it is rigged not to cool the room lower than 23 degrees regardless of where you set it. Again, you pay for it, but they just won't give it to you. And they lie to you about what you are paying for.I could go on, but you get the idea. The owners here don't really seem to understand that I can beat them at their stupid game without half trying. All I have to do is stay somewhere else next time. And I will certainly do that. I recommend you do the same thing.That's how you beat them at their own game.",324
MBS,2,“Lost sight of the basics”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a business conference in Sept 2010. My rating reflects a comparison with 4 and 5 star hotels that I use on average twice a month for business trips, mainly in Asian capital cities.I found the Marina Bay Sands to be heavily overpriced for the quality of the room and standard of service, even allowing for the discount I received as a conference attendee (I paid SGD300 for an \atrium deluxe\"" room). The quality of room fittings was average and far below what I would expect for the price from the likes of a Shangri-La, Intercontinental etc. There were problems in the room such as a broken light in the cupboard and a defective shower head. Although the room was non-smoking, there was a tobacco smell in the room and from the bed linen. As I was in the hotel for less than 24 hours, I did not raise a complaint with the management. Neither was my feedback requested.The check-in experience was poor. There was a 15-min wait for check-in with only two check-in counters working for Tower 3. I waited 25 mins (outside) for the shuttle bus from the airport, although the queue for taxis was not the hotel's fault, and the shuttle bus is free.I had a room service dinner and the quality was on the low side of average.While I found the hotel to be overpriced from my perspective as a business traveller, the hotel is obviously more focussed on tourists and in particular casino visitors. That's fine, although if I had visited as a tourist, I would have been disappointed to have paid my own money. Furthermore, there is not much accessible on foot around the hotel except for their own shopping centre (and of course the casino). I have since moved to another hotel for a short holiday and I much prefer having shops, cafes etc. around, as well as public transport.""",388
MBS,1,“Marina Bay Sands Just Dont Do It To Yourself”,"We have just returned from Marina Bay Sands and would like to warn people to just stay away. We have been to Singapore 6 times staying at different hotels and this was by far the worst we have ever been to.The appeal is the pool and view but other than this the hotel is absolutely disgraceful. The list of problems goes on from check in (which you can expect to take about an hour) to check out (which could result in missed flight if you don't leave at least an hour extra). Interesting observation, while you stand in the check in line you see all the people complaining about the hotel, when you check out you are one of those people complaining. Staff who are untrained to know anything other than \I don't know Sir/Madam\"" to \""someone will get back to you to fix that problem\"" which they never do.Ordering room service for a beer will cost approximately $10 per beer and will take about 45mins to turn up. Sometimes you will get a glass, others you will have to ring back for the glass, which will take another 45min to arrive. A bucket of ice well that will not turn up.Cleaning staff who sit on the floor, in the doorways of toilets and talk amongst themselves in there own language just signaling you with there hands to step over them to use the toilets, OMG.Maintenance staff who sit outside your door talking, which is marked Do Not Disturb, who get the front desk to ring you to open the door to fix electrical problems in the room. What does Do Not Disturb mean in the morning???Prices, well again you will be outraged and overwhelmed buy what they expect you to pay for everything food and beverage wise. Its cheaper to catch a taxi anywhere in Singapore eat/drink and be merry then return in the taxi and you will still have change from what your would have spent in the dinning area's. Summing up Bad Bad Bad everything except the pool and the view, which by the way you will have to fight through the hordes of public not staying at the hotel who are up there to look at the pool and the view. We highly recommend not to bother as the stress is not worth it.""",255
MBS,1,“Horrible service - borderline fraudulent”,"Our experience at MBS was surreal in the nightmarish way:We had booked and fully pre-paid a Grand room with city view on a high floor in order to splash a bit during our first stay at MBS. At check-in they gave us a standard room (worth ca $1000 less for our stay), when we objected they claimed they did not have any notion of what we had booked (except the full price of course). We had to login to the internet per mobile phone and show the confirmation email to prove what room type we had paid for. Next they said they didn't have such room available --- we paid the room in full 3 weeks in advance !!! They then gave us another lower standard room when we pointed out that we had already paid considerably more that what that room cost they said they would see if they could find some way to compensate with vouchers and call us back in the evening. After more than an hour of trying to check in we gave up... and went for the room they had downgraded us to, which was looking directly into the highway and the huge construction site next to the hotel.Did they ever call? Nope! That's when we decided to file a police report... Anyway - we are obviously never going to return to \Marina Bay Scams\"". I wish we had checked the reviews here before booking as I can see bad service seems to be a consistent issue at this hotel.""",245
MBS,1,“MBS is a five-star on paper but no-star in delivery...”,"Tis hotel sucks to the core. You get charged high rates but you get peanuts for services. I'll start with the positives, which aren't that many - the room is very standard (can be a real negative!), view is great! Pool is fantastic and the view from the top overlooking the Singapore skyline is beautiful....Now, the bad things abt MBS....and these will stop me from coming back there OR to ever recommend anyone to stay there....- the place is crowded like mad, service is bad - sometimes I feel like I am staying in a Chinese motel.- Staffs were rude and unprofessional, service is slow. - I tried asking for a late checkout and they asked me to call back on the day of my leave. - I was promised news paper everyday but I have to call them to get one.- Internet, though free can drop off anytime without warning. - Food's expensive and there are not too many options for breakfast. - Cocktail hr was promised to start at 4. We were there at 3 just relaxing at the very small and ordinary club lounge. Then we were told that they will only serve alcoholic drinks at 4.30. We ordered our drinks - they came half an hour later!!!! So much for free-flow!!!- No free parking - only valet services for $12 bucks per day...RIP off!!All-in-all, this hotel leaves me with bad experience, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

MBS,2,"“Maybe in a year, maybe never”","Impressing building, breathtaking roof, nice rooms, but lacks routine, friendliness and service. It is HUGE so you walk a lot and there is a queue for everything. I spent 35 min checking in, then 40 minutes to recover the luggage picked up from the taxi, 20 min waiting for a taxi to get out and 45 min to get out of the area due to closed roads. Same story from others. The roof was closed the first night for a private function, and closed early the two next for maintenance or something...(apparently it is a separate business area) . The \world of luxury\"" is confined to the brand stores in the empty arcade waiting for a lucky gambler from the casino, because most guests look like tourists with a good opening deal.Needs at least half a year and hope routine, friendliness and service has been established by then.""",136
MBS,2,“Serious Service Problems and a Challenging Location”,"While visually stunning, this hotel is one to avoid. Service is dreadful from long, long, long lines at check in - with staff that do not seem to know how to run the computers; to even longer lines at check out. The lobby - a soaring space is visually exciting but has no where to sit. (An important omission since you have to wait so long). Taxis do not want to come to the Sands - the loading/unloading area at Tower 1 is chaos - traffic completely blocked and ineffective doormen trying to move cars along. After a long flight, a 10 minute wait in the driveway to get out of the cab is the last thing you want. With so many truly wonderful places to stay in Singapore, this is one to stay away from.",6

MBS,1,“DO NOT STAY HERE”,"Despite the negative reviews we've read, we decided to give this hotel a try...being a \5 star\"" hotel and all. Turns out that it's the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. We waited 1 hour for the complimentary shuttle bus. We waited 30 minutes to check in with a staff who had no clue what she was doing. We thought that it couldn't get worst. We went up to our room only to keep our bags and left immediately cuz we wanted to see Singapore with the little time we had. Came back to the room at 3 am, opened the bed to find a blood stain on the bed sheet. I don't think this would even happen in a 3-star hotel! We called for the duty manager (who was not available at that hour), and the front office said they would send a housekeeping staff to change the sheets (no room change cuz it was full!). We waited for 15 minutes before I called and asked them where the housekeeper was, and they said that I had the DND sign on!!! I was outraged!!!! Where's the common sense!!!! They changed the sheets and apologized. We would've checked out if it wasn't already paid for!Next day when we came back to the hotel the security guard said very rudely \""show me your key\"" and she said \""always show your room key!\""This hotel should not claim themselves to be 5-star. Too much promotion. Their rooms are of low quality, the breakfast area was too full that we had to walk to a special area they set up, and the sky pool was always full of people. And the fact that they allowed people to go up and take photos at the area where the hotel guests are is a joke. There is no sense of 5-star at all. For the price we paid we could've stayed in a better hotel in Singapore.""",74
MBS,1,“Absolutely c**p”,"Stayed over grand prix weekend and this is the last night. So much wrong that there is no way this can become a good hotel and I will not waste too much time but to tell my fellow travellers not to stay here. The building, amenities, service and overall experience are a disgrace. I will never stay here again. Head of security mr koh gets a special mention for total lack of customer service.",101
MBS,1,"“great building, unbelievably bad service”","pros:- beautiful building design- amazing rooftop views- casino and shopping all in the same complexcons:- only a few people in line, yet took 30 minutes to check-in- let RANDOM people into the room without proper identification or verification- staff did not know where to get food and directed us to closed restaurants multiple times- asked for 500SGD entry fee to goto the bar in skypark- literally no furniture on their balconies- room service menu was almost completely unavailableoverall: better off staying at a different 5 star for the price; also, better paying the fee to see the roof versus staying here.",228
MBS,2,“Don’t expect too much & only go for the Skypark pool”,"What a shame. This hotel is not ready and it really shows. It’s too big and doesn’t feel welcoming at all. We waited 30 mins to check in and that was only because we were at the front of the queue!Basically the staff are rude and untrained, most of the shops and restaurants are not open. Those that are open really don’t care about whether you are happy or not and they won’t accommodate any requests. We ate in the Chinese restaurant in the lobby area which was very expensive and has shocking service. We waited 30 mins for our rice to arrive and then it wasn’t what we had ordered. As our meal was nearly over, our rice arrived. When I asked for the item to be removed from our bill the manager told me that since we had eaten rice eventually he couldn’t remove it. $20 for rice that we didn’t order – disgusting!The infinity pool really is the only highlight and it’s probably worth staying here for a night just to have access to it. However bring your own food and drinks up as the staff won’t serve you and even if you ask the menu is extremely limited and presented on a tatty piece of peeling laminated paper.A wasted opportunity, so perhaps worth waiting for a couple of years until they sort themselves out.",139
MBS,2,“Marina Bay Sands ?? Err... think again !!”,"Been to this hotel with my hubby for our 1st Anniversary. Totally disappointed with this hotel.We stayed at 16th Floor with sea-view room. Initially we've requested a King Size bed and confirmed with the staff upon check-in but end up we're given a queen size bed. Thou there's balcony in our room, it does not add any credit as there's no lighting and even a chair there !! Staffs in the lobby rather irritating.. Their face looks so stress that makes us does not feel like we're on vacation. Everyone is in their so called proper uniform but they never have a smile on their face. Food choices are so limited ! not even have subway, McD, KFC, etc.. Back to the hotel, we paid for $600++ and surprisingly breakfast not inclusive!!! wat a shock..perhaps that's called \Singapore Standard\"".""",262
MBS,1,“Don't go there if you don't want to be disappointed !!”,"We had a wedding at MBS in September and stayed there for 2 nights. When we checked-in to our rooms, there is a letter on the bed with the wrong spelling of our names, no welcome or wedding amenity during the entire stay. Room was not made up at all even we pressed \Please make up room\"" sign. Very disappointed with the stay especially it was our wedding day. I didn't feel welcomed at all and all the expected services are not provided. No bell desk staff assisted me with more than 3 peices of luggages, I had to go to Concierge desk and asked the staff to follow me to my room for the luggages. When asked for extra duvet, the staff didn't understand at all and kept sending the thin blanket to us. The banquet well fine, but the hotel services is such a disgrace. The worst was our wedding cake went missing and never delivered to us during our stay. I had to chase them on the issue after a week.We called for late check-out at 3pm, but before 12 noon, a staff called us to review our bill. The message we got there was please pay and check-out!!When we checked-out we highlighted all the issues and problems happened during our stay and the front office staff told us he would investigate and get back to us, but no one got back to us ever since. So, if you don't want to get disappointed on your big day with multiple issues and problems, think twice before you choose MBS!!""",26
MBS,3,“Shocking structure.”,"When i first saw the building form a far, it actually reminded me of the nuclear power plants in Bhopal and Chernobyl. Blind me.Anyway pleasant stay.",331
MBS,3,“Spectacular Hotel with a few issues”,"We stayed in this hotel on a recent stopover in Singapore.Our first impressions of the hotel were great, We were given a room facing the city and were impressed with the service on check in as our room was ready even though we arrived very early in the morning. No queues and prompt service.The room itself was large and very well equiped with an amazing view. The bedding was very comfortable and we did not hear any other guests on the rooms either side.The hotel is an experience in itself with the skypark and large array of shops just off the lobby area. The hotel obviously has some issues as you might expect with the sheer number of guests coming and going from the hotel. We saw a number of guests who were complaining about delays on check in/out but did not experience any problem ourselves.We did experience some long waits for the elevators on a couple of occasions and getting a taxi to and from the hotel can be difficult depending on the time of day. One cab driver told me that many of Singapore's cab drivers are starting to avoid the Hotel because of the delays.One thing we did not like was the high cost of food in the Cafes in the lobby ($80 each for a buffet meal.)Another annoyance was the noisy house-keeping staff. On both mornings of our stay when trying to rest all we could hear was the banging of doors on either side of us. It seems that the cleaners did not have keys for the rooms and so every time they go in or out of a room when cleaning the door bangs loudly shut on its lock without closing properly. This happened so many times that it became a major annoyance.Overall I believe the Hotel was a great experience but would stay elsewhere on my next visit as there certainly hotels in Singapore which are still very good for a lot less money.",704
MBS,1,“MBS stands for Malfunctioning Bay Sands”,"I stayed in MBS for 2 nights at the Club rooms which are situated on the higher floors of MBS. The good things will be - the excellent view of Singapore from the 49 storey, overlooking the Singapore River and the skyline, and the spaciousness of the rooms. N then comes the myraid of the bad..I expected MBS being a new hotel to have all their hardware to be new and functioning. However, it obviously did not seem so. First thing, the TV cannot be switched on. After fiddling for a while, realized the wires behind the TV was loose, so adjusted it myself.Second, the air-con is existent, but has a mind of its own. It cannot be adjusted to a warmer temperature as the air-con controls keep moving back to a freezing cold temperature of 21 degrees. So, in the end, I decided to swich off the air-con because by then, I had already caught a cold. -sigh-Thirdly, the DND light panel was not working. We did not want to be woken up by housekeeping knockin on the door next morning, hence we called the hotel staff to ask if the panel can be repaired. Staff came, inspected it for awhile n said cannot be fixed, n will call for a technician the next day. So a hand-written \Do no Disturb\"" was scrawled on a piece of paper n slotted outside the door. I am surprised they do not even have a door hanger thing that says \""DND\""?!So, next day DND was there, but it seems that the repairman did not see the huge DND sign there n knocked on our door. Hotel staff did not bother to call us first to let us know the repairman is coming. Poor service standards.. I stayed at other 4,and 5 star hotels before, n smetimes when we requested for additional amenities from housekeeping n the DND sign is on, the staff will call us before knocking the door to let us know that they are outside our door with the amenities. But not this hotel, as they are too job-oriented and want to finish their job fast.N being such a huge hotel, they only provide bottled water on the check-in day. Requests for another bottled water will not be entertained, even tho' u are sick(like me, thanks to the air-con) and there are no supermarkets around MBS. The staff will helpfully says u may boil ur own water in the room. Wow, that's nice.Stayin at the club room entitles you to access the club lounge at the first floor - Fuze. It is just small area of about 6 tables.. I expected i to be more spacious since MBS is soooo huge. But no, only a small area is allocated to the so called \""exclusive club members\"". Maybe it is so exclusive that, MBS purposely made the area so small then. The canape selection from 4-6pm is also pathetic, with only 2 hot selections, one selction of bite-sized pies, n 3 types of cheese, crackers, n veg sticks. Gosh, if I compare the canape selection of the lounge at MBS to Pan Pacific, then PP seems like a buffet spread. N staff was slow in replenishing the hot foods as both selections of hot foods were finished n guests were opening the covers to find nothing - surprise ~The operations are still very raw with the staff not being sure what other departments are doing. Because of their lack of knowledge, and not double-checking with the other staff, we were charged 2 times for the room. The staff had charged the room to the credit card when we checked in. N we thought it was MBS way of doing the operations. However, when we checked out, the staff wanted to charge us again. We told them we received an sms from the bank saying it had been charged but the staff insisted that it was not charged yet from the hotel accouts and will be charged.. So, the card was swiped, and true enough, when we check our credit card, it was indeed charged 2 times. All in all, it was a 5 star hotel, 6 star charges, 2 star service, and 1 star facilities.""",110
MBS,1,“Avoid under all costs”,"It's a disgrace to the hotel industry in Asia in general and for Singapore in particular. A train station like lobby, check in counters (after you found the right one) with queues like at low cost airlines economy check-in counters. Rooms with furniture which even wouldn't meet IKEA standard. Nobody to accompany you the room, even if you booked a suite. Even as a seasoned frequent traveller I couldn't figure out how to close the curtain in the bathroom and housekeeping over the phone could not help either. Turn down service in the evening? Keep dreaming. Service varies between non existent and very bad. Avoid this hotel under all costs.",603
MBS,3,"“A missed opportunity. Rough around the edges in every way, yet could be amazing”","I'll try and keep this review simple and to the point.Advantages:- Amazing infinity pool and view from the 57th floor- Spectacular building- New- Did I mention the view?- Some of the staff TRY to be polite even if they aren't good at their jobs- Rooms look pretty good at first glance.- Rooms quite well sound-proofed!Disadvantages:- Built to a price - you can see if you look closely in the rooms that this could be better for this class of hotel. It is far from dreadful, but the details are missing - low pressure water in the rooms, the curtains don't close properly so if you are working strange hours you might be woken up by the light. Feels like they rushed it together, and with such a big project it's understandable (though not acceptable) that they couldn't do the detail of a smaller hotel.- One side of the hotel has balconies, but no seats? Probably just used as a nicotine station for smokers perhaps? Who knows- Service pretty shocking. It's not that they don't try, but they are just not on the ball. I had to move room 4 times! I had asked for a city view room and after an hour of waiting (with a reminder call to reception) in my room at 2am they moved me to one, sadly it stank of smoke (I'm not that sensitive, but trust me it was bad), then they moved me to a new room, but back to the wrong side again! Finally I ended up in a city view room (smelled of smoke again, but totally bearable so I stuck with it). God I'm sounding like a difficult customer here!- Staff hover a bit too long for extra tips. It was embarrassing with one bell-boy who offered to make me tea, show me my TV etc, when it was 2:30am and I'd just moved into my room. I just wanted to sleep!- Room service food is very average indeed, yet expensive.- You almost always have to call them twice for anything - e.g. Laundry collection. They are not outwardly rude, but they don't really understand customer service. Something's not right somehow.- They try to be like Las Vegas but it's clearly not. The service isn't there, and they try to be a bit stuffy with the celebrity restaurants, when in reality in America they are a bit more reasonable with allowing people in and accommodating peoples' needs. If they cut the \exclusivity\"" vibe a touch, it might happen more naturally rather than feeling so contrived.- Many of the staff don't speak English. Of course I wouldn't expect that in France, Germany, China etc but I thought that they would in Singapore?Conclusion:Only stay here if someone else is paying (as in my case). Even then, you can do much better in Singapore. That said, the infinity pool is truly spectacular. I'm not sure if you can buy access as a visitor, but if you can then stay elsewhere (there are plenty of great hotels in Singapore) and then visit for the pool & view, it is worth coming for that. It's the sort of place people will continue coming to because of the fact that the building really is a landmark.One final thing - there is the possibility that this hotel is having some MAJOR teething problems as it is new. Things MAY be different in 12months time under better management etc. Read the other reviews and I'm sure you'll get the picture. I'm sure the reviews will echo this if the hotel improves, but right now you really can do much better in Singapore.PHEW!""",127
MBS,1,“Mickey Mouse operation”,"This hotel has a long way to go before they can be called a 5 star hotel. While I understand this is a new hotel, employees are under trained and have no idea what they are doing.Took 2 hrs to check into the hotel. Lines were extremly long, Staff were extremely disorganized and junior. No one seem to have any idea what to do. Breakfast was included in the room rate (overpriced) however it was served in the convention centre next door. Sky Park was spectacular and was inlcuded with my nights stay. In the end I only stayed 1 nught and moved to the Pan Pacific hotel for the balance of my 8 day stay.Would wait at least a year intil they fix all the issues.",337
MBS,1,"“3 star experience, 6 star rates!”","We booked Marina Sands for a luxury weekend away. It was an overwhelming disappointment for SGD$700 per night!!! I was appalled.1. Long queues for check in, check out, breakfast...2. Condescending staff and service3. The room had no drinks in the mini bar, and no water4. We didn't get the papers whilst other rooms did5. The taps were running brown water for the first hour6. No hair dryer7. The pool is so packed it reminded me of a public pool, on top of that tourists were freely walking around the pool area including skanky looking personnel taking photographs of the pool and the view, there was absolutely no privacy hence I wasn't comfortable to take a swim8. Breakfast was a nightmare, the queues were so long that we got ushered to an alternative breakfast venue at the convention centre. The queue there was even longer than at the hotel and it was possibly about a 15 minute walk. Food was mediocre.9. As breakfast too longer than expected due to the queues and delays. Hence we got back to the room at 11 am which was check out time. I called for late check out and was told that it was not possible. I had to become nasty before I was given an hour's grace. On top of that, when I called the operator the first time to be put to reservations for the late checkout, I was put on hold for 3 mins and when i was finally put through, it was an invalid number.We were considering the Fullerton and we shouldn't have given Marina Sands a chance, it was such an utterly disappointing experience that I will never visit it again.I met a friend at the bar at 5.30 pm and she angrily told me that she was still waiting for her room. Absolutely horrifying.I passed a letter of feedback to the General Manager and left my email. No one responded to me and it has ONLY been A WEEK.Visit only if you want a bad holiday.",876
MBS,3,“Can improve with time...but how much time?”,"ReservationsMaking the online reservation was no problem. Getting through the reservations hotline to a human voice, however, was a task nigh impossible. As something had come up and we had to postpone our stay for a week, I called to request for the postponement. The automated answer system assured me that my call would be “attended to in approximately 3 minutes.” This is a lie. I waited 15 min before the system hung up on me. I tried this 5 times before giving up and driving to the Sands to sort it out in person.Check-inThe website and booking confirmation stated to go to the lobby at Tower 1 for check-in. When we got there, there was a long queue at the main desk. However, there were guest relations staff who actively channelled guests away from the queue and toward other counters that they opened up in the other towers to deal with the crowds. We managed to get ourselves checked in within 40min.It turned out that they didn’t have any more of the Horizon Grand rooms we had requested for (high floor, city-facing), so they gave us an upgrade to an Orchid Suite on the 4th flr (“garden”-facing). Currently, the garden is still a dustbowl and at such a low floor, you only get to see the expressway. The traffic noise is quite noticeable, but I wasn’t personally affected by it as it was just like white/background noise.RoomThe room was reasonably large, though not as large as some other suites I’ve seen. The bathroom, on the other hand, was huge! There was lots of room for a shower stall, bathtub, toilet, 2 sinks…with more left over for swanning around in. Very good for people who like to take eons in the bathroom primping for a night out on the town or theatre. Oh, the large TV is located in the centre of the room and can be swivelled round such that you can watch TV from the bed, the sofa, AND the bathtub, should you so wish. That was cool. The bed is asian king size, not the huge king size ones like you get in the US. It was nevertheless comfy.The suite came with a Nespresso machine, which was much appreciated. We had to call concierge to refill the Nespresso bullets though, as somehow housekeeping had neglected to do this before we checked in.Speaking of housekeeping, there were some minor quibbles: the bathtub had some black grit in it, and the shower stall had some clumped hair on the floor, there were only 2 towels and no towel racks, but otherwise nothing major. For a 5-star hotel, this should not be the case, but I understand that they are still getting the hang of things so we should expect them to improve with time.One gripe we had with the service was that we requested for ice 3 times over the course of the evening and night, but no ice appeared. At all. On the third time, we asked why there was no ice. The reply was that they had run out of ice (?!?!). On further probing, it turned out that they had run out of ice buckets, because if you ordered a vodka cranberry from the bar, it came with ice. So we told them to just bring us 2 glasses with ice, no need for the bucket. We waited… No ice came. We gave up.PoolThis was the reason for the visit, and boy was it worth it. At a height of 57 storeys, you better bring a sunblock with SPF >50 cos you’re going to soak up some serious rays. We caught the NDP fighter jet formations preview from the pool. Very cool. The helicopters were so close, we could see the textures on the wheels. But back to the infinity pool… it’s something you need to experience; words just don’t do it justice. Yes there were screaming kids, and yes there were snot bits floating around in the water, but man, the panoramic view of Singapore from that high up just can’t be beat.Breakfast at RiseBuffet brekkie for 2 was included in the package. It was very good quality and variety was above average for a breakfast buffet. There were freshly made omelets, a small selection of dim sum, variety of salads, congee with all kinds of toppings, the usual cooked breakfast foods (eg. sausages, pancakes, etc…), different types of cereal, many flavours of jam/preserves, too many types of breads and pastries that there was no way one person could sample everything. Juices are plentiful and you could even take a paper cup of juice or coffee to go. Highly recommend you get there by 8.45am; once 9am rolls around, a queue of hungry hotel guests quickly starts to form outside the restaurant and believe me, you want to be on the happy end of that queue.ConclusionFor the price we paid (based on the Horizon Grand room ~$500), the experience was pretty good. But if I had paid the actual price of the Suite (~$800), I would have been disappointed with what I got. For this kind of price, I would have expected service to match. All in, it was an enjoyable stay, most notably for the pool and the great views.",1092
MBS,3,“Has improved but still some way to go”,"This is my third stay at MBS with the previous two stays in July & August this year.Reservations:My reservation was made thru the phone and I had difficulties getting thru on my latest stay. I couldn’t get thru when calling several times between 9am to 6pm - and got thru when I called about 10pm (it's a 24 hour hotline). On a previous occasion, I managed to get thru with my first call after 7pm. Reservation was competently handled.Check-in: The drive-in hotel lobbies have now improved as MBS has opened check-in counters at Towers 1 and 3. It is Useful if you know which tower you're staying in to avoid the long walk from one Tower to another Tower( about 300 metres from Tower 1 to Tower 3).Bellhops were attentive and at hand to assist me with my luggage as soon as I alighted. The Tower 1 drive-in d felt a bit small a crowded as taxis and other vehicles cluttered the drive-in. There are more check-in counters at Tower 1 with separate check-in counters for the gamers and VIPs. My check-in on a \non-peak\"" saturday morning at 11 am took me about 5 minutes including my request for a change of room to a higher floor. My previous check in on a public holiday in August took me about 30 minutes.RoomI was fortunate to be given an upgrade to a Bay room which was bigger and included a nespresso coffee machine and free nespresso coffee capsules.The room was big, spacious and clean with a flat screen TV. A number of free local, foreign TV including HBO and a football channel but no children's channel. There is also a paid Movie On Demand channel . There is a full minibar but be warned as it is a computerised mini-bar which automatically tracks and charges you for any drink that you Remove from the computerised drink holder - regardless of whether you consume the drink or not. The hotel has installed a wall mirror at the desk to facilitate blow drying your hair- previously, you had to use a portable mirror. While internet access is available (including wifi), it's not free. Room curtains are automated - however, the length of the curtain frames (or probably design) is too short and sunlight leaks into thru the small gaps at both ends since the curtains do not completely cover the windows. BathroomI was disappointed to find cigarette ash in the toilet cubicle (in a non-smoking room) which was not cleaned up by housekeeping. I managed to get a room with bath-tubs on all 3 occasions. I understand that some category of rooms (probably the Atrium Deluxe category) do not have the spacious bath tubs found in other categories. So if you want a bath tub, you have to ask when you check in. I couldn’t find anything on the MBS webpage that mentions about bathtubs for the Atrium rooms. Bathrooms have double sinks but no shelves for toiletries. HousekeepingRequest for extra soap and shampoo was delivered within 10 minutes. Housekeeping staff was a chinese national who had difficulty understanding my request for foam bath and asked me if I could explain my request in Mandarin to her but otherwise, she was friendly and courteous. RestaurantMy reservation didn’t come with breakfast but I was totally shocked to see a long queue of about 30 persons waiting to get into the breakfast restaurant downstairs at 9am. I don’t know how long they waited to get in but you can find alternatives across at the Shoppes (opposite the hotel). Prices at the hotel's restaurant are from S$22 + for local favourites like laksa, chicken rice FacilitiesOther than the incredible infinity pool on the 57th floor and its spectacular views, there isnt really much to do if you bring your kids along. There is a playroom, Qube, over at the Shoppes where kids can play xboxes, playstations, PC games, board games, watch movies,ping pong table for a fee of S$10 an hour or S$20 whole day. The Banyan Tree Spa has yet to open.Swimming Pool and SkyPark - 57th floorAccess to the 57th floor is by swiping your room key at the security counter. You enjoy a spectacular 360 degrees view of Singapore - marina bay, the indonesian islands to the south, the Singapre flyer to the east. Access to the Observation Deck of the Skypark is now free for hotel guests if you access it via the Pool . Other visitors pay S$20 to visit the Observation Deck which includes the east garden of the Skypark including views of and from the swimming pool. Observation Deck prices - beers @ S$10 served in a plastic cup, water and carbonated drinks from S$4. I would suggest that MBS management stop allowing the paid public access to the east garden as it is intrusive for hotel guests swimming and lounging at the pool (on the east garden side) or using the jacuzzi as members of the public are snapping away with their cameras or even gawking at hotel guests. If hotel guests want some privacy, lounge at the west end where the children pool is. There are no changing rooms for swimmers at the 57th floor or at all. You have to go down one flight of stairs (56th floor) to change in the toilets. AccessFrom MBS, you can walk (about 15-20 minutes) or take a public bus to the nearby Esplanade, Marina Square and Suntec Shopping Centre where you can find plenty of shops, cinemas and restaurants. There's a surcharge of S$3 if you take a taxi from MBS or the casino (mon - sat from 5pm to midnite, Sundays from 6 am to midnite) charged by the taxi companies and not MBS.Staff & Service Generally I find the staff to be friendly and helpful. They seemed to have improved since my first stay when I was given the runaround by the concierge and the staff as to how I could get to the swimming pool.OverallI think this property is recommended for gamers who need a room to sleep after gaming and use their gaming points to redeem meals at the restaurants. MBS is practically crowded from 9am to 9pm with guests and members of the public - as if the MBS lobby area were a tourist attraction. It's sleek narrow design makes the lobby feel small and crowded during peak periods of check-ins and check-outs. There's still plenty of room for improvements and it has yet to achieved the unparalled service and quality of a 5 star resort..""",194
MBS,1,“Five Star Hotel with One Star Service”,"Hi!I've been looking forward for my holiday to S'pore and booked a room at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) because it is a new five star hotel with a reputable management from The States. The disapointment came when the front office staff during check-in treat me like I am a prostitute from China and insist that I wait while she goes and assist other incoming guest (caucasian). Bad!Room is very plant and nothing fantastic to shout about for a five star. Sad!The view is the only amazing thing I must say, but a little too much to pay for and be treated like a prostitute. The sky pool is fantastic, but they shouldnt allow non-guest to wander around the pool area. Later I found out because they charge about SGD20 for them to go up to the rooftop which also gvie them the access to the poolside. No bloody Privacy!Anyway, I think the main problem to all the poor service and upkeeping of the area is due to most of their staffs are foreigners and not been train or qualify to a service industry. For that money, I rather stay at other hotels somewhere nearby.",37
MBS,3,“Over crowded”,"Too many sightseers constantly walking around the lobby, the skydeck has a $20.00 tourist entry fee which means there are people always walking past the pool area. Tired rooms after only 6 months, also not completely finished.",92
MBS,1,“Bay View or Ship View depends on luck”,"We book a suite as we wanted to enjoy the view of the Marina Bay. The hotel answer is we will only know on the day itself.

You get Bay View with other hotels (Ritz, Mandarin, etc) in the bay area.I'm happy to pay more for the Bay View. But MBS does not have such policy.",233
MBS,1,“3 star hotel includes roof pool with a view”,"I stayed in MBS as there were some good offers available just after it opened.First the good: it has a great pool (when not over crowded) which has a great viewNow the rest: They have designed a hotel with too many rooms and too few amenities. I got the impression that it opened too early, the restaurant capacity was too low for the number of people staying with queues of over 30 minutes to get to breakfast at the weekend. The service was terrible with queues at both reception and concierge desks. The finish in my room was poor (bad finish, bright lights glowing at night, terrible noisy a/c etc) as was the finish of just about all the public areas including the pool. I left a 4 page letter containing the problems I had and over a month later I have not heard back.Having stayed there for more than 2 weeks I saw no improvements and feel that the hotel itself will run down and date very quickly. This review could go on for a while and I have created a TA account specifically to do this review as I feel so strongly this hotel is *not* a 5 or 7 star hotel - it is barely a 3 star. Do yourself a favour and visit he pool area as a visitor, stay at the Conrad or Raffles or anywhere else actually.",204
MBS,2,“Extremely Overrated Hotel”,"What a disappointment !!! We had been looking forward to staying at this fantastic new state of the art Hotel ever since we had seen it being built last year. It looks amazing and I would have to say the architectural design is stunning but once in the rooms.......what a let down. The workmanship on the interior was really inferior, chipped and cracked shower tiles, toilets not working, basins leaking, door locks not working, tv\s not working etc etc the marble on the floors was scratched majorly in some of the lifts, I could go on and on. The carpet in our room was already very stained after only 2 months open, I hate to think what it will look like in 2 years time !! The look of the hotel complex is fantastic, the Sky Park is amazing however as we checked out at 12 noon but didnt leave for the airport until 6.00pm it would have been nice to be able to use the Pool facilities until we left, but that was not allowed. If you are wanting to stay in a nice 5 star hotel in Singapore go somewhere else..... The Pan Pacific Hotel on Raffels Ave was fantastic last year.""",90
MBS,1,“Two star hotel in a five star body”,"Terrible service, no nightly turn down, forgot to clean room during stay, 20minute line for breakfast, lack of food service, water provided once during stay only, smoking on non smoking floors, virtually no sound proofing between rooms. Whilst the sky deck was spectacular, access was denied to the pool when it rained one day, as I was advised I would get wet, even though I only wanted a swim to exercise. Whilst the casino will always attract a full house, the discerning traveller should avoid this hotel like the plague.",765
MBS,2,“A So NOT Luxury Experience (with Sewer Smell)”,"My family (3 of us) with a family friend decided to check out Marina Bay Sands and booked a SkyPark hotel package. The package consists of Premier room, Sky Park experience and breakfast for 2 persons.When we checked in, they were going to give us a room on 15th floor but will upgrade us to higher floor if we are willing to pay $20.00. So we did and got a room on 47th floor. The staff told me that the Sky Park ticket can be collected at the booth at one of the tower.We liked the room size and the view, and the fact that the bathroom has separate shower and closed toilet. However, when I entered the toilet, it has a very strong of stinky smell. So I ran out and called Housekeeping. After 20 minutes waiting and no one showed up, I called again and a male staff came in. Tried to explain to him but it was no use since he did not speak English. He re-cleaned the clean but super stinky toilet without a fuss and left. But it STILL SMELL THE SAME. Then I realised, it is the SEWER SMELL. Next attempt was to pour water into the drainage assuming that there was no water inside the P trap. But it did not work. Checked with our friend who stayed next door and theirs had the same smell.Since we only stayed one night, we decided to make the best we could instead of complaining. :))The next morning when we tried to go to the Sky Park, the security told us to get the tickets. So we went to get the tickets and only to find out a very long line just to collect the tickets. Since we were about to check out anyway, we decided to go to the SkyPark after checking out. So I asked to speak to a manager. A female Supervisor came out and asked if she can help. I told her I need to speak to a manager. So finally, a young male manager came out. The first concern was about the sewer smell in the toilet. He said he will go up to the room with the Housekeeping Manager. So I said no bother. It's not about cleanliness but it is about the smell coming out from the drainage which might be caused by some piping problem maybe?. He seemed to have no idea what I was talking about and he was supposed to be a manager. I really don't know what to say. After explaining to him about the package and the tickets situation, he did not offer an apology , but instead said that everyone will have to line up for the tickets even as the hotel guests. There was no privilege granted to the hotel guests as the Sky Park operation is handled by an operator. I told him the mechanism to get the tickets for people who signed up for the Sky Park experience is awful. So having paid SGD 439.00 (excluding tax and services) does not mean anything?. The Junior Manager called a manager from Sky Park operation and she said she will get the tickets for us so we can either come back another day or enter the Park after receiving the tickets. We waited for like 30 minutes to finally received the tickets. After handing over the tickets, the Manager said in a firm voice: \Mam, so that you know, we do this as exception and we do not do such thing as passing the tickets this way to the hotel guests. So please understand that this is a very special case\"". My friend and I were like, \"" So you turn this awful mechanism which is not our fault as if we were the difficult customer?\"" So you want us to line up just like other people who do not pay the hotel room and came just to see the Sky Park?\"". You guys should implement a better mechanism so people do not get upset and wasted time waiting and giving feedback\"". It was a horrible experience for us. From start to the end. I received an email a few days later from the Quality Manager, expressing apology about Sky Park incident but did not mention anything about the SEWER SMELL.I just write this so that other people will know what to expect and perhaps the management will do something about the SEWER SMELL.As for the Infiniti Pool, do not expect privacy as they let the public to pay and enjoy the pool too. It's totally overrated!""",179
MBS,1,“A disgrace of a hotel with a great pool and cheap management”,"The pool and view is fantastic! The room is okay. Way way to much money for what you get in return. I Spend Euro 300,- for a single night together with my wife.Beside the great pool and the nice view its a very avarage hotel. All the used materials feel and look cheap. There is already significant wear and tear ... and that only after a few months...As a guest you have to comply to all kind of silly rules and checks .. like you should be grateful your allowed to stay at this place.The main loby looks like a modern railway station ... cold and not personal.Staff is ill trained and not motivated. Its simply an embarrassment! When you only willing to pay peanuts all you will get is monkeys.Its actually a cheap 2 star hotel with a great pool combined with 5 star prices!!!If you visit Singapore and you have some money to spend ... do yourself and loved ones a favor and book an hotel at Pan Pacific or Mandrin Oriental (trust me on this ...)",829
MBS,2,"“So much potential, but very poor execution”","I stayed at MBS shortly after it opened in July 2010 for four nights. I had been in Singapore numerous times in 2009 and 2010 and had been constantly hearing about it from the locals. It is truly a stunning architectural creation, one that single handedly redefined the Singaporean skyline.The hotel is composed of three towers, 57 floors each. I stayed at tower 3, which is a good five minute walk from the reception. Contrary to other reviewers, my check in went well and I was upgraded to a top floor with city view. They have little pimped out golf carts to ferry guests to the towers, but they didn't work at the time I checked in.The elevators in tower 3 were outright filthy, still being dusty from all the construction. I even complained about it, but besides an embarrassed look by the hotel employee, nothing was done. I chalked this up to the hotel still being new.The room itself was large and spacious with minimalist decor. The windows were large, ceiling to floor, and offered a truly magnificent view of the city. However, the room was awkwardly set up; the bed was off in one side and the desk was diagonally opposite to it. And that was it. No other furniture, no decorations, just dead space. Frankly, the room would have been much nicer had it been smaller!The bathroom was quite nice, even though the hot water did not work for two days during my stay. Again, I complained, and the second time something was done about it.As all persons interested in the hotel know by now, there is an infinity pool at the top, the largest one at that height in the world. The pool is really breathtaking and a visit is almost worth it just to visit the pool. The pool is only open to guests and not to their visitors. Ridiculous, if you ask me, but the reasoning given at the time was that the hotel was brand new and there was great interest in seeing it. I accept that, but I felt unwanted as I was asked to show my card at the elevator at the ground floor, upon entering the sky park area (top of the hotel), and numerous times inside the area! Not the best way to make you feel wanted.At the time of my stay, there was only one bar open in the sky park, which constantly ran out of beer. All drinks were served in plastic cups and they also had a very small selection of snacks. Again, not the end of the world, but I would have expected something classier. I must say, however, that there was a restaurant and maybe even a bar under construction.The breakfast area is far too small for a hotel that size, and you could easily find a lengthy wait. However, there is the possibility to have breakfast at the bar in tower 2. The selection for a hotel this class is not excellent, but by no means poor.The hotel has a shopping mall and casino across the street. The shopping mall is the most ridiculously high-end mall I've ever seen; in all my travels in Europe, North America and Asia, I have never seen so expensive items on sale. They have *boutiques* of high-end watchmakers Breguet, Vacheron Constantin, Patek Philippe, along with the more pedestrian Rolex, Omega, and IWC. Very nice eye candy for a WIS.There are also world-class restaurants; we took our clients to Guy Savoy, who has 3-star Michelin restaurants in Vegas and Paris! Of course, we paid accordingly.I had a bottled beer and some french fries at the bar next to the reception. Apart from having paid 45SGD, they took forever to arrive (who knew a bottle of beer was so hard to fetch?) as did the bill. There was also utter confusion when I asked to put it on my hotel bill.Another complain I had is the parking area in the front; it is far too small, and they did not have a place where our rep could drop us off. We always stopped at the valet area and always had some guy complaining.A tip for checking in and out: there are counters in towers 2 and 3 that can handle that. During my stay, they were never crowded and always manned.Where the hotel fails is in its execution of customer service. Guests are constantly asked if they're guests, waits for any services are lengthy, and generally there is a lack of a personal touch that is obligatory for this price category.The problems of the hotel are not really structural, although there is some of that, and could easily be remedied by better management and staff training. I had hoped my bad experiences were due to growing pains of the hotel, and I am sad to see that there has not been any significant improvement since.It will be truly disappointing if by December 2010 the service remains this poor.",70
MBS,3,“Almost there....”,Room - nicely furnished but a few small corners cut here and there. Room service - average. The (interim health club) a big let down. Skypark - is really quite cool and the pool is amazing. Saw cigarette butts on the floor of the lift at 7:30 in the morning. Once they ramp up - this place could be amazing.Chinese restaurant quite good - but service still needs some work.,80
MBS,2,“Stay Elsewhere!”,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for two nights. The only plus features were the stunning building and the pool. Everything else is disappointing. The lobby is like a night market, the staff are overworked and irritable, the rooms are not cleaned well. Certainly NOT 5star experience. They cater mainly for the gambling crowd who do not care for the service. There are much better Singapore hotels with excellent service with much less cost. Should have read Tripadvisor reviews before booking!",76
MBS,1,“Marina Bay Sands (sucks)”,"This hotel is a disgrace to S'pore. The level of service is totally unacceptable. All tourist should avoid this hotel. My room was only ready at 5.30pm, when my check-in time was 3pm. The staff was totally unapologetic and the security staffs was rude.The lobby stinks as the rubbish wasnt cleared overnight. My room was leaking water because of poor insulation work. Wall paper falling off.This is the worst 5-star hotel i have ever stayed in.",112
MBS,2,“Take the $20 hotel tour and stay elsewhere”,"Beautiful hotel,& rooms.That is where your good experience ends. Very bad service . During a 6 day stay had to remind twice to make up rooms at 7 pm when we returned from shopping. in room service,half the itemes ordered were forgotten twice. basics like sugar, butter or ketchup were forgotton often and sent 20-25 minutes later by when food was cold.the terrace was open to public at $20 and so if you go swimming there are a 100 tourists looking at you taking pictures. the lobby was like a railway station . no seperate taxi queue for hotel guests so we had to wait 30 mins just to leave the hotel.",298
MBS,3,“Pool is great...everthing else ok...parking a big hassle”,"The highlight - Infinity Pool. Really enjoyed the pool and the view, although crowds were a bit of a put-off. Don't expect to get much swimming done as you'll likely bump into the next person at your third stroke. More suitable for a relaxing soak and splashing around. The bad - Main grouse was the very inefficient parking system, where valet is compulsory (understand it's due to the far away carpark?). During dinnertime, it can take at least half an hour just to get your car. Since by now staff should be quite familiar with peak timings, management should really consider ways to deal with this, whether by getting more staff or implementing a method which can improve turn-around time. Even in the morning when there's hardly anyone, it took about 10minutes before the car arrived. Unfortunately because this was my last impression before leaving the hotel, it has ruined much of whatever good takeaway I had from the hotel stay(note to mgmt also: all the effort put into ensuring an enjoyable time for the guest could come to naught if the last thing the guest takes away is frustration). The wait time and inefficiency of the parking system is a disappointment, considering a place which wants to position itself as a top luxury destination and where valet is compulsory. Smaller mention goes to the 22nd floor (where we stayed) at Tower 2, which had a bit of a smell due to some leaking it seemed. Rooms were not affected but the hallway had an unpleasant smell. Hopefully the issue is resolved soon.Not the best value, and there are definitely downsides. Worth one stay just to see the place and especially to experience the pool, but unless they work on the other inconveniences, no incentive for repeat stays.",370
MBS,1,"“Horrible Management, Severely incompetent staff, Shameful service”","From room booking to payment settlement, Marina Bay Sands has been more than a let down given its prestige. The room was booked for a business guest from Europe for a one day stay. I booked the hotel room one month before my guest arrival and told the staff specifically to charge to my credit card. I filled in a credit authorisation form that looks terribly unprofessional (looks more like a draft, without hotel's info as header and footer. one month later, day before my guest arrival, I received a call stating that MBS do not have my credit card authorisation form. It's lucky that I have an email confirming that MBS has received my fax on the form and then the hotel admitted that they've lost my form!! the form with all my credit card info and permission to use it!No compensation was made and staff was more concerned about payment for hotel then appeasing an angry guest whose credit card info was lost through MBS for a month. Finally, my colleague went down to settle the payment, signing another credit authorisation form at the hotel, in front of my European guest. We thought that the matter is settled but NO, MBS called me up to ask for my colleagues' credit card details!! I mean, are they out of their mind? Calling me to ask for someone else's credit card no.? and what for? Apparently, for the second time, they lost yet another credit card authorisation form, my colleague's form. And worse of all, they have charged the room to my European guest!!! The shock to me is beyond imagination. None of the upper management nor quality or service managers bothered to give me a call to apologise and explain how this could have happened. I've been to many hotels, from budget to 5 stars, from Bangladesh to Europe and this is by far, the worst experience. Don't bother to stay in this hotel even if you are visiting the MBS casino. The hotel has shown no responsibility in safe guarding mine nor my colleagues credit facilities through a simple transaction. One can't help but wonder how prepared they are against real dangers of cyber crimes and hotel security.",469
MBS,3,“Very good hotel but very expensive”,"This is a good hotel no doubt. It is an extraveganza built on a budget of $8 billion. It is located in the heart of the city. It is amazingly huge that you can spend an entire day inside it looking around the place. 57 floors in all, this hotel has more than 3000 rooms. The swimming pools are located on the terrace and the view from there is amazing and a 'must not miss' types. Also, the food is excellent at rise cafe. The staff is friendly and always willing to help. There is a shopping mall and a casino inside the hotel which are great places to spend time at. They have an artificial river stream flowing from within the hotel where guests can also enjoy boating. This is certainly more than a 5 star hotel. It is no doubt the most lavish and luxurious hotel that I have stayed in so far and trust me, I have spent almost half my life living in five star hotels. Having said all that, I would still not recommend this hotel to a friend because :1. When I go to a 5 star, I expect to be treated exceptionally well and paid attention to, maybe even get a little pampered by the staff. This hotel is too big to focus on an individual customer needs and requirements. We had booked around 40 rooms but we were attended to in a very ordinary manner.2. The reception is so crowded all the time it looks like a total chaos situation. It took each one of us 30 mins to check in and about an hour to check out. We had to form a line to check in and out. 3. The hotel room avg cost is $ 400 per night and you could find cheaper hotels who are more customer centric than commercial in singapore.4. Television shows only 2-3 English channels. Anyting else you want to watch, you have to pay for it. 5. If you dont want to use the minibar, do not even open it. It has a sensor which will automatically bill you for something when you open it. You have to then fight it out with the reception to get a revised bill at the time of checkout. This again causes delay.6. If food is part of your package then it's fine, otherwise its very expensive to order and eat from the restaurant.It is best to live in some other hotel. But make sure to visit this hotel to check out the casino, the terrace view, the shopping mall and the cafe's. And never handover any package at the reception to be delivered in someones room. I and one more colleague of mine did so, both the packages were lost and never delivered to the respective rooms.",146
MBS,1,“Nothing but a great view”,"Let´s start from the beginning:- Pick-up shuttle service from the airport works fine.- Check-In is a nightmare. Way to many customers and not enough staff for checking in. The lobby is more like a busy train station with so many people just walk in and watch the building.- Room was high floor, with a great view. The room was huge, but not cleaned up at all. Windows and mirrors in bathroom completely dirty. Same for the carpet. Had to call up room service to have a proper cleaning again. To get me right: I am not sniffing around in little corners, but for this price I would expect a high class service.- Room service took about 1 hour to get a sandwich.- Check-Out. Nightmare again.Overall: Just go to visit the skypark to enjoy the view and sleep somewhere else in a wellknown 5 Star, that works.",405
MBS,1,“Inadequate hotel with lacking facilities and customer service”,"1. Parking for Hotel Guests1a. The people at the Front Desk and Concierge did not know theirinformation well enough; telling me I can purchase the coupon for $15when I asked at check in regarding my parked vehicle.1b. When I wanted to leave the hotel and asked for the coupon, I waspassed from Concierge to Front Desk to Valet to Front Desk from Tower 1 to Tower 3.. The staff at Concierge could have simply called Front Office or ValetService to help me ask instead of making the guest walk with luggages1c. The Front Desk personnel finally told me they have ran out ofparking coupons. If there was a limited supply, it should have beencommunicated when I asked about it in the afternoon.Most hotels in Singapore have complimentary parking for guests.Now I was all ready to pay for the parking but I did not like the lackof proper service and service staff not knowing their roles well and not willing to go the extra mile.2. Service staff at the Pool Bar2a. When I walked to the bar at SkyPark to order drinks, I was holdingmy phone/hotel card in my hand and unable to carry both drinks to thedeck chairs. A service staff I asked to help me carry the drinks wasextremely disgruntled about it. Either the pool bar staff areinadequately trained in hospitality or the bar is understaffed toservice the hotel guests at the pool - both cases are stillunacceptable.3. Barely functioning carpark3a. Now that I had to pay the $28 full charge for parking, I needed totop up my cashcard. But to my disgust, there is a top up machine butnot functioning in the carpark. I had to trek back up to the casinoentrance to use an ATM machine for top up. Now, if the hotelfacilities doesn't have full functioning capacity, why bother openingto the public? Which carpark in Singapore does not have an option for cashcard topup?3b. When I drove to MBS, the signs showed there were two carparkentrances (South and North) but North wasn't opened. The signs did notillustrate that and I had to u-turn a couple of times. If there issomething not available, the hotel should not put up the signs first.All in all, a terrible hotel with facilities not up to par and service staff badly trained. A hotel that does not bother to create a good experience for staying guests but only to churn money out of its casino operations.",1918
MBS,1,“Utterly embarrassed and disgraced to have such a PATHETIC hotel on Singapore soil!”,"I am a Singaporean working in China and I return home once every 1-2 months to visit family and friends. I made a trip home in August with my partner and we decided to spend the weekend at MBS. This was despite all the terrible reviews I had seen on this website so perhaps it was my own fault, but we had thought \oh well, just give it a shot, maybe we'll be lucky and have a good time.\"" I could never have been more wrong. I called the hotel the day before arrival and notified the Room Reservations department that I would arrive early at 8am (I was taking the redeye flight) and would like to confirm that I could check in early to rest. The staff assured me that the room would be ready for me at 8am when I arrived the next day and that she had made a note on my reservation to prepare the room. When I arrived however, I was told \""All our rooms are fully booked. Normal check in time is 3pm. If you're lucky, maybe I can give you a room at 12 plus.\"" That was it. Not a word of apology nor any offer of an alternative option I could take. I stared blankly at the guy behind the check in counter for a few seconds and after an awkward silence, I replied \""I informed your hotel in advance that I would arrive at 8am and was assured that the room would be ready. What do you expect me to do now?\"" The young guy replied without emotion \""All our rooms are fully booked. There is no room available now.\"" After being on a plane overnight, I was tired, hungry, hot and sticky. I could NOT believe that this brand new 5-star \""world class\"" hotel which was supposed to offer \""out of this world experiences\"" to its guests would have such poorly trained staff with such poor service attitudes. My partner tried to help the guy by suggesting that he call us when the room was available and the guy agreed and took down our number. We made our way to the nearby Fusion Cafe for breakfast. Despite being hungry and thirsty after a long flight, the food was horrible. The omelette was only 2-fingers wide after it was rolled up and placed on my plate and I could just about count 5 mini-cubes of mushroom that the chef put into into my mushroom omelette. The french toast and dim sum were cold and rubbery. The coffee was burnt. And to top it off, after we finished at about 10am, we still had not received any call about our room. We walked back to the check in counter to enquire on the room and were told \""There are no rooms available. Nobody has checked out yet as check out time is 11am.\"" I looked at the line of people queueing to check out and asked again \""Are you sure nobody is checking out yet???\"" The reply was \""Some people are checking out but their rooms are not made up yet.\"" Again, my partner calmly requested that they inform Housekeeping to expedite cleaning up our room and call us when it was ready. We then went to the SkyPark to take a look at this much-talked-about feature. It was an utter disappointment. The cushions on the deck chairs were stained and dirty. The pool was overcrowded. There were fallen leaves all over the floor; evidently nobody bothered to sweep and keep the area clean. There was one miserable bar there with only 1 table and it was stated \""Hotel Guests Only\"", which meant that we couldn't even sit there for a drink because we hadn't checked in yet. At about 11am, we still had not received any call about our room so we went back down to the check in counter to ask. Again we were told (with an impatient tone) that the room was not ready yet and if it's ready, they would call us. I was seething at this point because I was exhausted and fed up with the unempathetic response of this hotel's staff. It almost felt as if they felt that I was disturbing them non-stop. I repeated again that I was told by THEIR hotel staff that my room would be ready when I arrived 3 hours ago but have been kept waiting without any apology or gesture to make things more bearable. I had once stayed at Mandarin Oriental and they did not have a room for me when I arrived, and after apologising, they immediately offered me a complimentary spa treatment so that I could \""freshen up\"". At MBS however, the response I received was \""We only have one room at 7th floor.\"" I replied \""No. My reservation is for a room on the upper-levels.\"" The lady behind the counter breathed out a sigh as if to say \""You're so troublesome\"" and then clicked away at the computer before saying \""I have another room on 9th floor. Is that ok?\"" I blinked at her and was truly at a loss for words! My partner, who has been very calm and patient so far, asked her \""What does your hotel consider as Upper-Level floors?\"" Then she replied \""Above level 22 is upper level\"". We looked at her and said \""So 9th floor is NOT upper level right?\"" In the end, we had to wait AGAIN.We went to the casino and retail section to see what it looked like. The whole retail strip was dusty and dark, and the bathrooms had poor lighting and smelled of urine. The store assistant at the Apple shop was rude and arrogant - he didn't even bother to look at us when he talked to us! Finally at 12 noon, we still had not received any phonecall and we were convinced there HAD to be rooms available by now! We went back to the check in counter and the entire lobby was swarming with people making beelines to check in / check out and there was another looooong queue at the taxi stand outside. We went up to the counter and asked about our room, producing our passports again for the 3rd time. The lady asked \""Anybody call you to say your room is ready?\"" I replied \""No. I have not received ANY call but I'm very sure there are rooms available given the long queue of people checking out or who have already checked out and are queueing for a cab.\"" Without emotion, she clicked away at her computer and finally said \""The room is ready.\"" Whilst I was totally pissed off that there was no word of apology nor had anyone called us earlier, I was more relieved to finally have a room that I just took the keys and went up.In the room, there was no bottled water, fruit nor flowers (which I thought would be standard at any 5-star hotel in Singapore). The bedroom slippers were too small for my partner's feet (and he's just a size 8!) and after I got out of the shower, I realized that I could not blow-dry my hair in the bathroom. The only wall sockets in the bathroom were two-pin sockets but the hairdryer was a 3-pin plug. In the end, I had to dry my hair beside the bed, standing by the wall. The internet connection was slow and patchy so I gave up trying to check my email after half an hour of connecting and re-connecting. Before we made our way out for a late lunch, I turned on the \""Please Make Up Room\"" light so that the housekeeping could give us a turn-down service before we got back at night. When we arrived back at the hotel at 2am, the room was not made and so we had to re-use the damp towels from the afternoon (there were only 2 towels in the room). My partner had to work that night and wanted to turn off the lights except for the desk so that I could rest, but it turns out that the one switch to turn on the lights, turns on ALL the lights and also turns off ALL the lights at the same click. So in the end, I had to sleep with my head under the blanket.The next day, we decided to check out using the Express Check Out facility to avoid the long queue. We left our luggage at the Baggage Counter and went out for lunch with family. When we returned in a cab to pick up our luggage, we were told by one traffic marshall to wait at the side further up and they would bring our bags to us. But just as the cab driver was parking at the side, we heard a series of loud slams on the trunk. There was another guy, likely the valet guy, slamming on the cab's trunk and screaming \""Eh you cannot park here!\"" The cab driver wound down his window and told the guy that we were instructed to wait at the side for our bags, which would only take 1-2 minutes at most. The guy shouted back \""No no no! You cannot park here! You go outside and wait!\"" At this point, I wound down my window and told him \""I am a guest here and I'm just waiting for my bags. We were told to wait here by the traffic marshall.\"" He shouted again \""Cannot cannot! Want to wait, go outside wait and U-turn come back!\"" I couldn't tolerate it any further and blurted out \""Your hotel has VERY POOR service and bad attitude!\"" The guy seemed a little shocked and then said in a lower tone \""Go outside and U-turn come back. Thank you ah..\"" I was really at a loss of words. Did he think that by adding the \""Thank you ah\"" at the end made him polite??All in all, my trip home was totally RUINED by this horrible hotel and poorly trained staff. The hotel building itself was spanking new but the quality was BAD. It was so obvious that the construction was a rush job and the detailing was poorly finished. I daresay that the hotels in China have even better quality finishing than MBS! The whole hotel just reeked of \""cheap\"" from the dodgy lighting to the distasteful carpet and mid-range brands of equipment used in the rooms. Perhaps they were in a rush to complete on schedule and were trying to cut costs due to the over-budget from earlier years (when sand prices went up in Singapore). It was really such a disgrace. I have never felt more embarrassed to be a Singaporean, knowing that tourists who come to my country and stay at this hotel would have such a nasty experience. To all those who visited Singapore and had unfortunately stayed at MBS, I offer my sincere apologies and hope that you would visit my country again in future, but yes, please stay at another hotel. Any other hotel would be better. To the management of MBS, I hope you are reading this and will do something about your staff and the facilities of the hotel. On hindsight now, I wish the IR bid was won by the Keppel Land/Harrah's Entertainment group instead. They would have done a better job on both the construction and operation aspects for sure... because it just can't get any worse than it is now at MBS.""",361
MBS,2,“Not a 5 Star Hotel”,"The good:1) Beautiful swimming pool and amazing views of the city2) There were fireworks that could be viewed from our own room. 3) The service staff at the concierge, pool and reception were friendly and helpful.The bad: 1) The moment we entered the hotel, it was crowded with lots of people standing around. There wasn't a lounge nor were there any seats and we had to ask the concierge where to check in. The layout of the hotel was rather unfriendly. 2) Hotel security were also unfriendly. They checked if we were hotel guests on 2 occasions but they did not ask nicely nor greet us at all. We are hotel guests, we shouldn't be made to feel like an intruder. When we stayed at the Fullerton Hotel, even the Maintenance Technician carrying a ladder around, greeted us.3) We had to have breakfast across the road at the Convention Centre and the quality of food was considerably less than what a 5 star hotel would serve. 4) There is a construction site facing the hotel. Hence, the air was dusty causing an allergy. The balcony from our room was also dusty and have not been maintained.5) The refrigerator is weight managed. Meaning if you lift anything such as a Coke from it, it will be automatically charged to your room. We had to make space in the fridge for a bottle of wine, so we removed some drinks and was told to call the concierge to remove the charges for them. After calling and explaining, they agreed to remove the charges. However, upon check out, the charges were still billed to us.6) The hotel has 2500 rooms and attracts all kinds of people and I mean all kinds, even the annoying ones. Children splashing water at me while I was lying by the pool and a bunch of ah bengs in the pool that were just as noisy. They even had a 'talented' rapper among them who was really going at it. It was as good as spoilt milk. 7) We had to queue 25 minutes to check out. Overall, the MBS experience was less than 5 star and spectacularly unspectacular.",524
MBS,1,“This is not the Singapore you know or have heard about”,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a business meeting. I arrived at 1 am so my check in was not as long as others but that was where the differences stopped.This is a typical Vegas like hotel in size and everything is grand. The service is HORRIBLE. Lots of people standing around but no one knows anything or does anything. Honestly, I am not sure why they have all these people hired. There are 3 people checking keys to make sure you only go to the elevator if you are a guest but ask a question and no one can help.The hotel is not finished yet - no signs in the elevators telling what is on a particular floor. The fitness center is in a temporary home in the hospitality lounges and only opens at 6:30 am. When asked why we could not get in earlier they said there is just no way. Made no sense at all - the casino is open 24 hours - I don't need an attendant to work out - just open it - it is not near any hotel rooms, no one will be bothered.The one nice thing is the pool - again, if you can put on your headphones and drown out the multitudes of people. The views from the top are stunning. Pay your 20 SGD and go see it - avoid the hotel.The breakfast, if not included in your room, is 48 SGD and there is no deviation, even if you just want a piece of toast. The location - you are far from everything. There is not even a convenience store close. When you only get 2 bottles of water and a Coke is 8 SGD, you need a convenience store. On the first morning, I went to take a shower and the water was freezing cold. It would not get warm. I complained and they eventually sent someone to \fix\"" it. It was a warm shower for the rest of my stay - not a hot one.The rooms are average - there is nothing spectacular about them. The beds are not comfortable. It is really a basic layout with no character at all. I had a seaview so that was nice but that was about it.Housekeeping - not sure what they did in the room each day - they did not vaccuum, did not straighten anything - I guess I am lucky the bed was made. They also do not offer enough towels.When I was checking out, I called for a porter and was told it would be 45 minutes. Well, no time for that, so I lugged my bags down and even when I got to the first floor, no one helped. If I had been at the Shangri La or the Four Seasons, I would have had people clamoring to help. I then had to wait 45 minutes to check out. They said I could use express checkout but I did not trust them enough to get the bill correct. Avoid this hotel - maybe it will get better but for now, it is definitely not worth the price.""",680
MBS,1,“Lesson learnt with exorbitant price paid”,"Purpose that i booked a room in this hotel was to celebrate my wife's birthday. We had an unforgettable experience, in the wrong way with all the wrong reasons. YES!! it was my fault cause i failed to read the reviews here before booking :-( and all the wrong reasons are as follow;1) If you drive, I would advise not to, normal parking charges SGD$28 for a day and their valet SGD $15 for 24 hours with a disclaimer, 'if the hotel valet is full you will be redirected to self park at elsewhere which is not very nearby the hotel or another stupid valet park over at the casino side\ EVEN if you are staying in the hotel, priority would not be given to you. EPIC failures.2)Checking in and out takes approximately 45mins, checking in was slightly longer and I did not check in at the peak hour of 3pm, I did it at 5.30pm and eventually got my keys at 6.15pm, i checked out at 11am started queueing and got it done only at close to 11.25am. Service failures. Oh they have the express check out system with a liner in it stating that you authorize them to deduct whatever you have spent on the credit card you checked in with, \""would you take this risk\""? I didn't.3) There is no communications between their \""priority service thru the room phone\"", the guest services at the registration counters and their valet guys, the system failed totally. As i was forced out of the hotel car park by the valets, I was supposed to be parking with the casino valet, not knowing the way there, I asked 1 of the valet from the hotel side, sadly he gave me the wrong directions. I ended up self parking in the south car park which was exceptionally far from where i stayed and you now have to pay for the parking bcos it wasn't free. So all in all I paid for the valet and now i have to pay for the self parking in their car parks. which means $15+ $28 just for parking. I wasn't pleased, I wanted them to rectify this matter because all thanks to their chaos i ended up in the wrong car park. I called their \""Priority sevices\"" thru my room phone told them the whole incident, they said no problem approach the front desk registration counter they can help, i went down repeated the whole story to the front desk guys they say maybe the phone services didn't know that they couldn't and I have to approach the valet guys, Okie the thing is i stayed in tower 3 and the valet was in tower 1, make a guess of how long you have to walk from one end to the other and then repeating the story once again to the valets. Due the the valets not giving the priority to hotel guests, and directing me to the wrong place, my wife and I missed the night scene from the skypark. It took almost 1 1/2 hours to get my car parked when i reach at 9pm. Consolation was the valet unwillingly asked me to fill up my details on a record sheet and gave me a complimentary parking ticket. All was ruin and the ticket didn't helped much.4)Room was spacious but was very dirty given the pedigree of this hotel, I had stained armchairs, potato chips crumbs all over the carpet and strands of hair on the bath towel. The view from my room was facing the city and i have to say it is breath taking but that's all you can take away from the dirty 5* room.If you asked me, you can stay there if you have SGD$550/night to burn with high level of tolerance and you must love sufferings. The chaotic mayhem would spoil all the happy mood that you have initially arrived with. There are plenty of hotels in the vicinity of the same value with miles better quality. Avoid this one by all means till it is fully operational.""",139
MBS,1,“Not worth the premium”,"We paid a premium to get a room on National Day after being promised Horizon Deluxe room \located within the higher floors of the 55-storey hotel tower\"".1) Checked-in at 1245hrs, got the keys at 1630hrs, when the standard is at 1500hrs2) Room was not cleaned, towels from the last guests were still on the bathroom floors, beds not made3) No fresh towels/soap/shampoo available. Made the request at 1630 but got these at 2000hrs after repeated calls4) We were put on the 8th floor despite the promise of higher floors and premiums paid5) Encountered staff who couldn't communicate well in English and need to get someone else to speak.The only credit was the duty manager was calm and polite in managing us. He even hinted that we write in to the management to complain.Such a disgrace for a landmark hotel.""",859
MBS,1,“Disgraceful service”,"Our recent stay at the Marina Bay Sands was a total disappointment. We arrived at the hotel at 12.30pm and there was already a long queue forming. It took us an hour to get to the registration desk and we were informed that our room was being cleaned, and that we will receive a phone call on my mobile once the room was cleaned. We were provided refreshment vouchers at the Bayview Lounge located at the convention centre across the hotel, which was probably a modus operandi of the hotel to hopefully distract guests from the check in delays. After waiting close to 2 hours and having received no call from the hotel, we decided to walk back to the hotel to check the status of our room. After waiting in another queue for key collection for another 30 minutes, the first thing the counter staff asked was if we had received a phone call. In other words, don't bother me if no one had called me. True enough, the response was that our room was still being cleaned and we were advised to go to the Bayview lounge or the shops. That was already close to 4pm, 3 hours since we were told the room was being cleaned. We had no recourse but to stand around and wait. Mind you, this hotel does not have any seating at all in the lobby. The scene is just a pool of people standing around and you get the feeling that you are at an exhibition hall. While waiting, we could not help but overhear the conversations going around - angry guests disappointed that hotel had misled them into thinking they were booked into city facing only to be told otherwise, disappointment with bedding arrangement in the room, inexperienced staff not able to handle queries - the list goes on. No one could quite comprehend how a hotel like this and under Sands Management could fail to deliver on customer service by such a wide margin. Granted the hotel was running at full occupancy, however you would have expected that the management would have stacked the right resources and planning against the anticipated demand as this information would have been privy to them way in advance. They obviously have not got their act together, or simply do not care. We were finally given a room close to 6pm, and that was only after \begging\"" the hotel to just hand us the key to an uncleaned room as my 2 young kids were totally exhausted standing around. Even this took a while convincing the hotel staff to release the key as up to that moment, they checked the system and said the room was not ready. When we got to the room, however, it had been cleaned. By that time, I was livid but kept my calm and told myself to just enjoy the rest of our stay and that nothing else should go wrong. How wrong can one get!1. We booked a rollaway bed during reservations - it was not in the room. Was told sorry they cannot provide as hotel was running full occupancy and there was no more available.2. We asked for an extra pillow and blanket - was told the same3. Our friend who checked in same day as us called room service at 5pm to send some cutlery to his room as they were dining in. He got a knock on his door at 11pm - the staff had finally made it to deliver the cutlery - 6 hours later ! Wonder why they even bothered. 4. Hotel confirmed late checkout till 6pm for us. We were not able to get into our room after swimming at 12.30pm. Had to go downstairs to reactivate the key card and had to wait for the slow elevator and queue all over again. 5. No newspapers provided, which we have come to expect as a given having stayed in so many hotels. Amenities in the bathroom were limited - one set and that's it. We booked as 2 adults and 2 children. Bathroom only had 2 bath towels.6. Instead of bottled water already placed in the guestroom, hotel staff came to deliver 2 bottles of water in the room and those were the only ration we got throughout the stay. 7. Be careful of the minibar. Any item removed for more than 30 seconds would trigger a debit against your room account as having consumed that item. As the minibar was stacked to the fullest, our friend who had bought a pack of milk for his toddler asked the staff if some items could be temporarily removed to accommodate the milk - was told he would be charged $20 for this service. This is utterly ridiculous!Marina Bay Sands had clearly not placed emphasis on wowing customers with positive customer experience. This will be our first and last time staying at this hotel. Architecturally, the hotel is superb from the exterior and boasts a fine skyline for Singapore . Other than this, there is nothing else worth experiencing and the service culture leaves much to be desired, which is a shame.""",981
MBS,1,“Terrible stay for the birthday boy....”,"Hi all, when me and my partner read the reviews, we all thought that maybe the individuals here were just too picky and we were so dead sure that the same wouldnt happen to us! Boy were we so wrong! My partner was so nice as to book a stay at the marina bay sands during national day on 9th august 2010 and also to coincide with my bday on 8th august. She booked the hotel on May 12th 2010, hotel just opened end of april 2010 by the way and she made a kind request that the rooms faced the padang where the fireworks were to be held and the view was cofirmed via email, only thing that wasnt confirmed was the high floors which was subjected to availability, which was fair enough. So the day came and we were excited, we knew that the place would be massively packed with ppl and took it in our stride, we got there early at 12pm and check in was surprisingly smooth, we were at tower 3 by the way. We waited for about 5-10 mins to check in and the lady told us were situated on room 3221. We assumed that we were already given the view of the fireworks but when we opened the door, we were facing the opposite side! So of course, we went downstairs and asked them if they had made a mistake and thank goodness we had that email on the phone and we talked to the manager by the name of Mr Jason Chan. He attended to us and he said that the city view rooms were all booked. We showed him the email specifically stating that the city view rooms were promised, just not on which floors. And here comes the crunch, he just said, sorry it was full and we cant do anything about it, and in addition the person that we communiated with a few months back regarding the view was Mr Mohammad Mahatir of customer guest realtions, Mr Jason Chan said that well, if i was in his shoes, i would have never have promised that. To me i thought that was suicidal customer service. I guess that was when we got very angry and he then gave us a discount on the rooms, charged us standard rates and gave us free breakfast coupons and a late checkout. Me and my partner were just wondering, why couldnt have they just told us simply the city view rooms werent available way in advance and we could have gone elsewhere since we booked it in the month of May! And in addition, how could they charge us a premium city view but gave us the seaview instead! That was very disturbing and i think the entire staff at marina bay sands needs overhaul.So once that was settled, we thought we had to make the best of it since we were already there and we wanted to go to the skypark to catch the views. We expected it to be packed but the skypark ended up like a public pool on a weekend. The marina bay sands obviously didnt know how to handle the masses for this sort of event has they had revenue on their minds and just booked the place 100% solid. Everywhere we went within the building or in the elevators, ppl were just saying, this is ridiculous, this is unbelievable, waiting for elevators for 30 mins just to get up, obviously crowd control is a major issue on big events. Why book the place 100% solid where 70% of the ppl are unhappy when you can make the place 70% full and have 100% ppl in there happy? I aint sure which is a better alternative but the latter sounds much better.In addition, by allowing non hotel guests into the pool area where its already packed with hotel guests is pretty dumb as they should have just allowed the non hotel guests at the skypark area on the other end and just have the area cordoned off foor us, i mean, they pay $20 and get to see what we see as well? And we paid $500 per nite for it.Now for the other stuff within the room, i thought when i read the heater issues, i thought it was funny, me and my partner just laughed, but to our disbelief, the heater in our rooms werent working either, not sure if this was a form of retribution quite frankly, but basic ammenities not working are just unacceptable in my opinion for the price that the hotel is asking for.All in all, facilities wise, its gorgeous, the pool is stunning, but it takes so much more than that to make this hotel a wonderful one. The service here is terrible to say the least, they obviously cannot manage the huge crowds expected during National Day and coming from an Integrated Resort that boasts on attracting up to 100,000 visitors a day, its appaling and just overpromises and under delivers by a massive mile. Me and my partner will definitely not stay here again, i think the biggest disappointment was on my partner's expression where she took great pains and effort to plan this day for my bday and everything just went downhill because the place was full, EVEN though we had a written confirmation of the city view, thats pathetic and I hope Marina Bay Sands will improve themselves for their future guests as we will definitely not be part of it next time.By the way, Mandarin Oriental and Ritz Carlton, service is impeccable and the price is the same or slightly cheaper than the marina bay sands and on top of that, breakfast is included and valet service is free for hotel guests, as compared to us paying close to $30 for valet, completely extraordinary! Pathetic Marina Bay Sands.",82
MBS,1,“In desperate need of Singaporean Organisation”,"Sorry, we didn’t get any further than check-in (15h00), as after one hour of queuing we’ve finally been told that a) our reserved Horizon rooms weren’t ready and b) the requested and confirmed city view rooms were no more available. (Reservation made and confirmed 4 weeks in advance)As we had no intention to pay SGD 2500.00 for sea view rooms missing National Day Parade we cancelled and left this highly overrated Hotel. What a disgrace for Singapore’s highly valued customer satisfaction policy.",51
MBS,3,“Nothing missed if you didn't stay here!”,"If its the casino you are after, as well go to their sister hotel - Venetian in Macau. The Marina Bay Sands has several teething problems working against their reputation. Service quality is at best average. Room quality was reasonable. I would have greater expectations from a chain of their caliber.",143
MBS,1,“Why so cheaply made? Not a 5 star hotel”,"After looking at the pictures we decided to take a chance even though the reviews were not good. We definitely should have listen to the reviews - bad check-in experience, no customer service, no help with luggage, lies told about their own service when asked, not knowledgeable, cheap standard on rooms, bad working TV, bad unfinished rooms, corridors, restrooms etc. Not all facilities are up and running and building work still ongoing. Staff not helpful at all, Even though we were a party of 6 people the other two rooms were not able to put anything on their rooms to pay later at check out - unbelievable - Not a 5 star service - Definitely would NEVER recommend Marina Bay - There are so many other hotels in Singapore that are so much better, Swiss, Pan Pacific, Mandarin Oriental to name a few",1298
MBS,3,"“honestly, this is un-singapore”","Had a good laugh reading thru the reviews.. decided I had to pen something.For me, I occasionally bring my kids (2 & 4y.o.) out for a single day weekend 'staycation' so my tolerance of imperfection is far higher than those on an expensive vacation trip.For whatever reason that I have forgotten, we have decide to pick 31/7 (last day of offer) as the day we will try to 'enjoy' the offer by MBS to Singaporeans at large (399$/night on the premium room, with breakfast and $50 spending credit).Well, unknowingly, its the full dress rehearsal of our national day parade that's happening just across the marina at the big field.A few days prior, realizing that its the rehearsal, I emailed the front desk asking for a room facing the city. Its subject to availability but well, things turned out fairly ok for me.Anyway, the key search-phrase, PACK!With the casino running 24/7, hundreds if not thousands of Diamond members having chalked up tonnes of free points/rooms. Last day of the local stayer offer. NDP (national day parade) rehearsal. 'Pack' is an understated word.Was told the check in time is 3pm. Arriving at 2.40 the queue was already like 150pax long. Having stayed in a fair number of 4/5 star properties, it's the second time I encountered such 'vibrancy' at a good class hotel. The last time was at Venetian in Macau.. another Sands property (that tells where all the exciting asians go for vacation!).1 hour wait and got my room registered. But was told I was placed in a Orchid Suite, and the room will only be ready in 2 hours.Fine, it was a good sunny day so brought the family up to the roof top. Knowing that the hotel starts checking in at 3pm, extremely surprised that the swimming pool is already packed with people!Skipping the in betweens, by the time I got my room its 5.30pm. They were supposed to call me once the room is ready, but knowing how busy these ppl are we decided to just pop over to check the status and got our key.Ok, the upgraded room is excessively huge and impressive. Got the city facing room on the 50th floor, and since its a suite I get to see the other side (sea facing) as well. Overall decently furnished. But for some reason the bathroom was locked up and when the porter came with our luggage, told him about the problem and he went about to settle it for us (which he did).So leaving the chap to help us sort out the room, we went up to the roof top swimming pool. Granted the hotel is packed for the day, I have a nagging suspicion many staying guests are bringing their friends around and packing the roof top garden to the max. There are hardly any pool deck chair available and if one is opened up, you just have to snatch it! Crowd control could have been better. I think they shld really close up most of the roof top place to just hotel guests, especially on a day like this one where the hotel is so pack.Pool water was surprisingly cold on such a good sunny day.Anyway, when the NDP rehearsal started.. The roof top is really a good place to be. You will probably think that the jet/helicopter flypasts were planned with the Sands in mind.. Watched the fireworks in the hotel room and again, the blooms were like literally opening up at your eye level! Amazing view even better than what I got at Mandarin Oriental two years back!Had no problem with the bath/hot water and so forth. Well furnished bathroom with 4 towers (most hotels give you 2 or 3 max if its close to 5 star). Hot water was abit slow in coming (half a minute or so?!).Tried to order room service. The menu stated that anything less than $30 would incur a $5 delivery charge. But that's moot this round, after getting to the in room dining recept within 3 minutes, was told the hotel had a gas-cut and is unable to provide any food. 'Anything that you don't have to cook' --> 'Let me check for you... err sorry sir there is nothing the kitchen can send out now'... And unfortunately, the nearest shop/7-11 is like a km away at esplanade!Breakfast in the morning?! Well, the missus had the foresight of bringing us there early as crowd is expected. Got a very 'cold' table after 15 mins wait --> for some reason the hotel decided just to blow tonnes of cold air out of this air-chute near our table (other air chute seems not to be used). Nevertheless noticed that the hotel was preparing for this huge influx of guest. They opened up the other two restaurants for breakfast and set up a 'breakfast by the bay' across at the convention center. Spread was good and very comparable to the nearby 5-stars.Had some issues during check-out with the $50 credits that was part of the package. The system did not recognize some spending and tried to get me to pay for it. But upon explaining to the lady the problem, she just took the initiative and took $50 off my hotel bill. All in how I felt about the stay:1. That Sands was badly designed. With so many guest rooms, the dining facility is hugely insufficient. Maybe the opening of the expo center will alleviate the situation but that is yet to be seen especially if guests need to walk across so far just to have breakfast.2. Sands was overly ambitious in putting out this local-stay offer. The infrastructure is unable to handle such high occupancy rate at the moment. Maybe we are the beta tester (u get a good rate so don't come harp on the services! we let you stay cheap to help us debug the problems!). Drive-in entrance is heavily bogged. Valet service for all hotel guest is simply not a good idea. 3. Information flow and system is not well set up. Frontline staff were not told of major issues (e.g. gas stopped last night) that they could have faced guests grievance of.4. Insufficient preparation. If room service has been stopped, and no alternative available, the hotel shld have prepared alternative solution (e.g. pre packed sandwiches).5. Crowd control left too much to be desired. They shld close the roof garden for pack days.Why I am saying this place is very much 'un-singapore'... well, my normal comment, as a singaporean who travels a fair bit on work/leisure, that singapore establishment (e.g. SIA) usually have a good operating procedure and infrastructure, but lack guinea service mindset. Sands was just the opposite. The Standard operating procedure are totally undefined but the staff tried their best to be helpful.Comparing to the earlier guests that found the place miserable.. I guess the main reason I didn't feel that way was the excellent view of the parade flypast and the fireworks that literally bloomed in front of our full floor-to-ceiling window. If I have not gotten the good room I probably would have felt alot more miserable and not so neutral in my comments.But having stayed in quite a few of the hotels near the marina (e.g. Ritz, Oriental, Conrad).. I would still rate the Sands favorably. Not sure why but I never had good impression of Ritz (Sg, KL, HK, etc). Oriental was more expensive and the rooms are much smaller. Conrad gave good obliging services but again when I was using it I was a diamond hilton member and that gets me alot of perks.Would I come back again ? Maybe in 6mths or a year. Let's hope they sort out some of their infrastructural issues and figure out how to solve those inherent systematic issues.8-P",368
MBS,3,"“Thank God my stay went well, despite a reservation problem”","Curious because I did not get any confirmation number after making a reservation almost a month prior, I finally made a phone call to confirm it the night before my check in day. After several calls and a 30 minute wait for a rep to answer my call - which is worth another review by itself - I finally found out that I did not have any reservation at this hotel. I started panicking, but the rep was good at handling my case. He helped me with my reservation and I finally got the three rooms that I needed. I was expecting the worse from then on, and the image of being stranded in Singapore with extended family members without a room kept crossing my mind.The stay was uneventful. My room, Horizon room on the 38th floor, was huge at more than 60 m2. One could easily fit in four king beds in the room. The room and the bathroom were sparsely furnished, too bland for a five star hotel charging this much. There is no turndown service in the evening - I didn't request but I never had to request for such at other similar establishments in Singapore. The service level is definitely low here. The housekeeper did not even understand when I told her in English to come at a later time in order to clean my room.One of the perks of staying at this hotel is being able to go to the Skypark at any time for free. The pool and jacuzzi have stunning views of the city from the 57th floor level. There were too many people watching though, there is no sense of exclusiveness at all. Only in house guest are allowed to use such facilities, however, people are roaming around to see them using the facilities. It felt like being on a public beach where a lot of people can't swim.When I checked out, I felt relieved that I had a reasonably good stay here. I probably lowered my standard by several notches during that stay because I was expecting for the worse. I stayed there because I wanted to stay at an architecturally spectacular hotel and that's just what I got.",1631
MBS,1,“Not recommended to stay”,"We’ve not gone on a family holiday for quite a while and we decided to do an overnight trip to Singapore. We decided to give Marina Bay Sands a try. We booked four rooms on the 15th July (2 days before the trip to Singapore). We chose the Marina Bay Club Rooms at SGD 439++/ room. The description on the website sets the expectation high for good services and facilities by the hotel.Upon arriving the hotel at about 4pm, to our surprise, the hotel parking was full. We had to park at the Convention Center located opposite the hotel. I got down with our luggages to check-in. The wait at the check-in counter was not long. This is where all the nightmare started. I was told that our room is “ROOM ONLY” and it does not include breakfast, access to the Marina Bay Club facilities or the Sky Park. I told the front desk this can’t be it since I paid SGD 439++. As we were all tired, we decided to check-in first, and check with the concierge later.Upon entering our room, I was amazed by the room. It was clean and tastefully decorated – but the sofa is missing! (We clearly remembered seeing the sofa in the website!) Anyway, that aside the facilities in the room were great – full bathroom features, iron and ironing board, Nespresso machine, etc.While the rest of the family members rest, my husband and I decided to call the concierge/reservation department from our hotel room to check on the details of our reservations. To our amaze or rather amuse, the phone was NOT working. I couldn't call the concierge, the room service, the spa, NOTHING. So we had to get to the lobby to check it out with the concierge.We were greeted promptly by the ladies serving the concierge counter. They both helped to check on the status of our room. The system clearly shows “ROOM ONLY” and the lady was surprised that with the high rate that we were paying it can’t be room only. She also confirmed that we were booked on the Marina Bay Club rooms which comes with breakfast, passes to SkyPark and usage of the Fuse Lounge (in lieu of the Marina Bay Club). One of the ladies called the reservation department and was told no breakfast but the room comes with 2 passes to the SkyPark. But when she checked the website herself, she found that it should come with breakfast and access to the Fuse Lounge.In the meantime, the other lady tried to help by going to Tower 3 to find out in details about our rooms reservation – if it should comes with breakfast, access to the Fuse Lounge and passes to the SkyPark. And to my surprise, she came back and said yes, it comes with everything. Hmm… but the other concierge lady just put down the phone with reservation department that breakfast was not included to our reservation/room. By now, I was really confused with all the contradicting information. Both ladies promised to try to sort this out and call me.By this time, the rest of the family came down and we decided to head to the Fuse Lounge to enjoy the Complimentary F&B served there. To our surprised, we were told by Elvis that the access to the complimentary F&B hour is over – they only serve up till 6pm! And it was 6.40pm already by then! Hmm… what happen to the complimentary F&B throughout the day and evening? Anyway, Elvis helped us by “upgrading” our normal door card to a “gold card” which will help getting the access to the SkyPark. He also assured us that our rooms – the Marina Club Rooms – come with breakfast (either at Rise or Fuse) and 2 passes to the SkyPark! Great! Problems solved! We were happy, and now the kids are getting hungry. So we decided to head over to the nearby shopping area for dinner.To our disappointment, most shops were not ready, only a handful of restaurants were open! We walked around and found the Chinese restaurant but it’s fully booked until 9.30pm! Gosh! The kids were getting pale from lack of food! And so we saw a tiny food court (I’m not even sure if it qualifies as a food court!) that serves mixed rice and chicken rice. So we had our dinner here.After dinner, the kids were tired and we decided to head back to rest. My husband and I decided to stop by the front desk to check on the parking fee. To our horror, we had to pay S$25 for parking full day at the convention center. But Jonathan at the front desk was kind enough to tell us that we can pay for S$15 and use the voucher that he gave us to leave the parking. And we could use the same voucher to repark at the hotel valet. Since Jonathan is so helpful, we asked him about the status of our room again just to be sure. AGAIN, we were told “ROOM ONLY” and there is no breakfast, no SkyPark. Ok, this is bad. We spoke to so many people and we are still getting the mixed messages! I showed him a print out that the concierge printed out for me – a printout on the facilities, services and privileges that comes with the Marina Bay Club rooms which clearly states:- Access to The Marina Bay Club (Only available once Marina Bay Club on the Sands SkyPark opens)- Access to the Fuse Lounge- The Fuse Lounge services, exclusive to Marina Bay Club guests include: Complimentary Food & Beverages throughout the day and evening (American Breakfast, afternoon tea, evening cocktail & canapé hour, an all-day open bar serving complimentary non-alcoholic beverages) complimentary internet access, newspapers & magazines, laptops available, MacBooks available, complimentary printing services, local call and access to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck cantilever (2 passes for one-time access)And Jonathan disagrees and said that the printout stated “Only available once Marina Bay Club on the Sands SkyPark opens.” And I said “Before The Marina Bay Club opens in 2010, Marina Bay Club Rooms will still be available, with all the benefits available exclusively at Fuse Lounge on the Hotel Lobby, Tower 2” and pointed on the second paragraph of the print out. And dear Jonathan paused. He told us to wait while he decided to check with someone – probably someone with higher ranking. We waited for a while and he finally came back said that our room comes with breakfast at the Fuse Lounge. Great! And I asked him what about the access to the SkyPark. And well, he totally forgot about it. He went back in and checked, and came back out and confirmed we go have access to the SkyPark. Wonderful! Finally everything is sorted out. I told him to make sure that he entered that into the system so that when tomorrow comes, I won’t need to repeat myself!After all the trouble I had to go through, I finally return to my room and soaked in the lovely bathtub for relaxing.At about 12 midnight, my in-law came knocking at my door. What else could happen in the middle of the night! Apparently there is a power cut! I cannot believe that it could happen to such a prestige hotel as this! I used my hotel room phone to call the concierge for assistance. I waited outside the room for assistance. After 15 minutes of waiting, we couldn’t wait anymore. We decided to search for the fuse box in the room, and found the tripped fuse and flicked it back. The wait was just too long and we just couldn’t wait anymore since it was way pass midnight. In the end, someone came only after about 20 minutes after I made the call.Next morning comes, we enjoyed our breakfast at the Fuse Lounge. They have a special area, a secluded room for Marina Bay Club Rooms occupants to enjoy the peaceful morning. We had guests with us, so we signed the receipt that the 2 adults + 3 children breakfast were to be charged to the room. The breakfast was great.Then everyone head to the swimming pool while I went for the queue in Tower 3 to purchase the additional tickets to access the SkyPark. When it was my turn, I was told that all rooms do not come with any free access to the SkyPark. Hmm… then I whipped out my “Gold Card” and she went like “Oh, you’ve got the special key cards, then yes it should come with the free passes.” Great! (Thanks Elvis!)The view up there was great. And so this is how we ended our stay with Marina Bay Sands. We were clearly disappointed that the staffs are not well informed and we had to sort out all the issues ourselves by talking to so many different people! So the family decided to have a good lunch at the Jin Shan Restaurant.How could this trip get any worse? How wrong we were at that moment. We all had our food served promptly, but one was left out – Fresh Crab Meat Fried Rice. We checked with the waitress for 3 times and she kept telling us “Sorry, it’s coming.” Other tables came later and they were served and ate and left. We waited for ONE HOUR for the rice to be served.And this is how miserable our stay was at Marina Bay Sands – and it ended with a bang at rock bottom! I’ve never had any experience any worst than this! I had better stay in a Bed & Breakfast in Europe! We have decided not to recommend to anyone to stay here, not for at least another year.",120
MBS,2,"“Incomplete, incompetent, incredibly expensive..”","Give this place at least a year before considering. 2500 rooms and only a few lobby food locations. I guess its ok if you are a gambler, at the boring casino across the road. Super expensive restaurants at the casino, but I hope the quality and name of the celebrity chef/owners is there. Staff all seem to be in space, nice looking young team that have no idea what they are doing. Did see managers roaming around trying to keep things in order, but it will take time. Room was nothing special, and I noted that no tub in the bathroom, only shower. I will be back to my usual room at the Hyatt on my next trip to Singapore.",400
MBS,2,“Wait at least 6 months before coming here.”,"I work in Singapore and thought I would treat my wife to 3 nights in the Marina Bay before returning to the UK for my leave. As a regular visitor to Las Vegas I had high expectations of a Sands Group Hotel. I was aware that it was still under construction and not all facilities were available, and went with an open mind. I don’t mind paying a little extra for something special but one thing I hate is being ripped off. And at the moment this hotel is ripping people off big time. I booked online and part of the deal was an upgrade on the room. This was not offered at check in but after pointing it out to the check in staff we were given the upgrade. The room was ok but nothing special for a 5 star hotel, the bedding smelt damp and although a non smoking room, cigarette butts in the balcony flower bed and a coke bottle with stubs in it.... No bottle opener in room, extra charge for internet, no ice machines or ice buckets. Called and had ice delivered for the wine we had brought, 10 minutes later staff were up to check the mini bar, they make a big deal of the pressure sensitive mini bar..... No complimentry water replenished during the stay. As mentioned it is still a construction site and we found our self in many areas where work is still going on and the over all finish is pretty poor at the moment. The pool deck is spectacular but again still areas under construction and during our stay lots of children in the pool so if you want to relax, it isn’t going to happen here. Also you are viewed by all the non hotel guests as the walk along the viewing area, very much like being in a gold fish bowl. Very few food outlets open yet and if you want breakfast beware, S$45 for a buffet breakfast, I would have accepted paying S$20 - 25 but 45 was a rip off. Everything has a 10% Service chare added and 7%GST. If you take a taxi from the hotel, a S$3 surcharge is added by the hotel. Casino entry is an event and be prepared to show your passport at least 3 times to different people on the way in and again on the way out ?????",518
MBS,2,"“No No No, I would NOT recommend this hotel at the moment.”","My, my, what a disaster!The bloke and I stayed here for two nights (at a rather expensive cost of $440 SGD p/n) and didn't enjoy it one bit. The three page complaint letter that I have fired off to the hotel manager is summarised below:When we arrived on the 9th, we came via the free airport shuttle that the hotel provides. We were unceremoniously dumped in the parking area and told to go up to reception. There was no signage, no porters to assist with our luggage and frankly, it was a horribly unwelcoming and smelly area. Once we struggled up the escalator with all of our bags, and arrived into the atrium space, we had to navigate our way to the reception desk, again no signage so we almost ended up going the wrong way. This was an issue as frankly, after a 14+ hour flight, I do not want to have to drag my bags around the very large reception space trying to find reception.Once in room (4494) there were:1. No towels in the bathroom2. The toilet smelt of one-week-old-kimchi-eating, dead rat. I asked them to fix it and apparently someone came to the room, yet it was still stinky when we checked out. To the point where I preferred to use the reception toilets.3. Filthy dusty windows on the inside (I discovered this by leaning against them to take a photo in my, rather expensive, silk dress).4. No in room dining menu, we presumed it wasn't yet available like most hotel amenities, but it actually was.5. No mini-bar price list. 6. Internet is extra @ $30.Other issues:1. Hotel restaurant (the only one) closes at 10pm, and rumours had it that they had actually ran out of food as well.2. Most things are not open such as the Skypark restaurant & bar, and most of the shops in the shopping center bit.3. The gym is in one of the hotel rooms which is very disappointing. Its unlikely that you would want to use it. This poorly operated space is also the only refreshment option available if you check out, but have a late flight and want a shower.4. No Spa, in room massage is also not available.5. Concierge service is appalling. They have not done any of the tours, lack local knowledge, and the best restaurant they could recommend for me when the hotel one closed, was jumbo seafood in clarke quay (which is mediocre). I was extremely disappointed with my stay, especially as we had paid so much to stay there. Had I only paid $150 for example, it would have been fine as I would not have had expectations such as having somewhere to eat, a gym and spa for example.This hotel does have potential though, so maybe stay here in a year when everything is opened and it has had time to bed down a little. Or stay there now if you don't mind paying an extortionate amount for no amenities, smelly room & rubbish concierge.I would recommend the Fairmont (stunning bathrooms) or the Fullerton (colonial elegance) as an alternative to this hotel.K",206
MBS,3,“Teething problems with a spectacular view”,"We checked-in on a weekend so the hotel was absolutely packed. There was a queue to check-in which took about half an hour. I was then given a room in Tower 3 which is a 10 minute walk from the reception desk in tower 1. The rooms are fairly large, finished in simple contemporary style. I got a room on the 33rd floor with a spectacular view of the marina.What I liked -Spacious room42 inch tvGreat viewGood service and efficient staffAmazing infinity pool on the rooftopConnected to mall and casinoWhat i dislikedConfusing switches for lights with no labelingClock not workingOnly one hook in bathroom to hang clothesOnly shower - no tub even though its a luxury hotelShower was'nt hot enough, pressure was low alsoTv showed only 20 channels including 2 hotel channels, nothing for kidsThere was a 30 minute wait for breakfast due to the rushThe hotel allows visitors to go to the rooftop to see the view by buying a ticket - so there are always hoardes of tourists in the lobby area. Its a nice hotel but absolutely avoidable on the weekends due to the crowds. Its only been open since 2 months so they need to get over a lot of teething problems.",471
MBS,3,"“overated, stay way away no responsible service”","RE: Marina Bay Sands Singapore 1st callwas on 8.07.10 to 10.07.10The hotel has no service at all. Every little things (mistakes and inefficient on the part of the hotel) become a big problem and instead of sorting it out and admit mistakes, they put the onus on the clients.MY SAGA:On arrival, they were no one taking care of the luggage from the taxi although there were several “door” people they. When I ask one of them, he said, you need to check in first. He directed me to a check in. after a long queues, I was told it was a wrong counter; the other counter was right on the opposite site. I again asked any help with the luggage, the answer “you have to ask it over there yourself” almost 45 mins was wastedWe were given a key to the room. No one take us to the room. When we arrived we found the room was on the lower floor directly opposite a construction site.After many calls to the hotel, we reach the “correct” person, we will than allow the change of room. Again we have to go down to the receptions and line up again for a further 20 minutes. Again given a key. That is all. We were expected to move our luggage myself . After many many protest phone calls, I was than told someone will come and help us. By this time almost 3 hours were wasted.We than decided to cancel our second visit for the 9th of July and the 18th of July. You cannot believe this: after giving the merry go round they will not let me cancel saying that I need to ring a different reservation number dedicated to reservation. I rung the number and after more then one hour I got no result.By the way to ring this reservation number the hotel changes 45 cents for the call. They will not put me through from the hotel operator.I was than ask to contact American express in Australia, I ask again the operation to put a reverse call. She said that it is not the hotel policy to do collect call or to put calls to the reservation.On principal I like American express to refused the 45 cents I was change for calling to cancel my booking. This is to send them a message. I want them actually to send me a change for the refundPlease note that in more than 40 years of travel this is the first complaint I make. My recommendation is STAY WELL AWAY from this the view is not that fantastic, we move (our second call) to Westin, and the view and service is million times bteer than Marina bay sandssuch a overated hotel should be avoided if you want a seamless holiday. it will become a stress",104
MBS,1,“Terrible .. Not fully built ..”,"This hotel / casino is like an air-conidtioned building site, the shops are about only 20% complete - there is nowhere to eat, sandwiches are being sold for S$4 outside the casino entrance. Restaurants at the hotel side are simply out of control - no systems of waiting for a table, nothing!Staff are rude - and unless you are a VIP gambler, I beleive that you are welcome.IF you really want to visit - Wait until 2011 when the facilities are fully open. I dont understand why they have 'opened' at all yet - they are not ready. Construction is still the major attraction.",196
MBS,3,“Ordinary 5-star hotel + Excellent Skypark”,"I did experience some of the bad service as mentioned - the concierge answered my questions in a crude manner: when prompted whether it is possible to have a room of a higher floor, he replied, you are already checking in early, I cannot do anything about that.The room was also as mentioned, bare and pretty standard. There are no oomphs when you step into the room, as it is pretty much a standard five-star room which you would come to expect. What is disappointing in the room is that the toiletries used here are cheapskate ones, normally found in three-star hotel rooms. The view from the room, however, is fantastic.What gave the hotel a great plus point is the Skypark. The infinity pool overlooks the city from a new perspective, and there is no other hotel which can match this. The view you enjoy here would be a memorable one. A downside though, is how there are no hot food available at the bar.There is quite some way to go - and there is a need to ensure that they give every guest a 5-star experience, something that the building has, but the people lack.",38

MBS,2,“DON'T WASTE your money here”,"Despite reading the negative reviews, my mother and i decided to stay at this hotel to see the architecture. But i discovered first hand, that EVERYTHING that is said in reviews were right. Don't waste your money here. With the amount of money you will be paying, there are other 5star hotels with BETTER service, view, value. 1. NO chairs to sit at the lobby upon checking in. Too many ppl/ only 5 ppl at front desk/ took 20 mins to check in. service horrible2. we specifically told them we didn't want to stay at Tower 3, after reading horrible reviews. bt we were guaranteed that everything was fixed, so after being upgraded to a higher level in Tower 3, we stayed there. BUT, when we were about to take a shower at 11pm, HOT WATER WASNT WORKING. i had to call 6 times for two hours before anyone showed up. by that time, everyone on our floor was going to the front desk to get this problem fixed. However, when the handy man came, he blamed US for not knowing how to turn the hot water on. HORRIBLE SERVICE. after hours of complaining, we finally got a room changed to Tower 2. with BETTER view, bigger room, much bigger bathroom as well.3. Our room was covered in dust. this hotel is NOT FULLY BOOKED. dont let them fool you. not enough maids to clean the room. even our sheets had dirt in it, even though the hotel was opened few weeks ago. after we changed room to tower 2, we opened the mini fridge to discover mango juice from the previous guest. maid didn't even bother checking the fridge, i dont want to know what else they 'forgot' to clean. 4. Construction constantly going on throughout the hotel. Even if you have a \nice\"" view, all you will be hearing is construction and construction. If you have the balcony room with the view of the sea, expect ciggarette butts all over the flower bed. maid didn't bother cleaning or maybe the construction men has left it there. 5. No place to plug hairdryier in the bathroom. need to take it all the way to the desk where there is NO mirror. 6. Breakfast buffet. Had to wait in line for 30 minutes just to eat breakfast. with over 2000 guest rooms, the 50 tables they have next to the lobby is NOT ENOUGH. 7. plus it was raining all weekend, so the rain was leaking through the roof everywhere.This is not a place you want to pay the ridiculous amount of money they are demanding for the POOR service and the accomodation you will be receiving. THis hotel really needs to change their attitude.""",227
MBS,3,"“Terrible, Bad and a lot of room for improvement”","This Hotel is far away from a 5* Hotel, only the Architecture is great. The reason for my bad ranking are:-> Valet Parking: It could not be that you have to wait 5 Minuets that some comes and takes care about your car. The same timeframe and much more you have to expect when you  want to claim it back-> Breakfast: It is unusal taht in a 5* Hotel you haveto be lined up and have to wait between 5 and 10 Minutes to get a chair. The restaurant is to small comparing to the amount of Guest. The Serice People take your plate 5 seconds after you finish your berakfast Breakfast is oriented towards asia people, far away from an intercontinental breakfast what should be in a 5* Hotel normal-> Room: No free Internet and the bathroom is max. rating 3* due to teh fact, that the shower is not very sufficient, it tooks time to get at least somehow warm water and the wash basin is not deep enough to wash your hands...Summarize:I travel roughly 200.000 Flightmiles per year and I know a lot of Hotels which has less stars but in all above categories much better then this worse hotel.

MBS,1,““The lunatics are running the asylum!.””,"I actually watched a discovery channel program of the building of Marina Bay Sands whilst staying at the hotel, and it is an amazing building! But that is about the most positive thing I have to say about my three nights spent at the Sands.I have stayed in many hotels around Asia whilst living in Singapore for the last three years. To date the Sands has been the worst. I agree with most of the previous reviews the customer service was none existent! We stayed in tower two and in order to get to the pool we had to go down in the lift and walk through the lobby and then up in another lift at tower 1. Not very practical when you are dripping wet. The whole experience of the pool was awful, the lifeguards whistle at you if you so much as sneeze. I stopped going after the first day.I could rant on forever about the service in the Sands, or lack of it, but one phrase springs to mind to sum it all up, “The lunatics are running the asylum.”!They have a long way to go to make it right! Not a good start and I will certainly give it a wide berth.",140
MBS,1,“Terrible all around.”,"This place is terrible - the reception started with a leaking roof, and 30 minutes to check in even though I was the only person in the queue!

Everything seems to be under construction though!!While I loved the big pool on the roof, overall the \sky garden\"" experience was also terrible, lousy food and drink selection, \""under construction\"". The staff seemed totally untrained. The restaurant food was just lousy, but that's typical of a buffet. If you want a nice hotel experience, stay away from this place! They also ended up charging me for an extra drink even though initially I had asked them to take it off. Now I'm stuck having to dispute that charge!""",250
MBS,3,"“Stunning building, poor service”","This is a stunning building, with beautiful rooms and a fantastic pool on the roof (3x 50m pools).However, the service is really disappointing; it is a massive building, but they're just not set up to handle all the guests. If you arrive at a busy time, you'll have to queue for breakfast, queue to check-in, queue to check out... and not short queues, but long queues.And even though the hotel has been open for some time now, the staff act like it is their first day on the job. We had dinner in a Chinese restaurant in the hotel and while the food was really excellent, the service was terribly disorganised. We must have had 8 people \serving\"" us constantly (and repeatedly asking us the same questions over and over), and yet they weren't attending to the basics, like noticing that we didn't have enough menus, or that we've finished with plates, or that we had piled rubbish on our table.The building itself also has a few teething problems - during rain they had buckets everywhere to catch the leaks, and the rooms had some issues - strange feint odours from the toilets.Overall, I was happy with the stay. I stayed mainly for the pool, and enjoyed the food -- I was happy, relaxed and not eating at busy times so the staff didn't really bother me. I was in Singapore on a brief stopover, but I definitely wouldn't stay here on business or for an extended period of time.""",76

Some staff are very helpful and professional and is the only saving grace for this place. Sky park is extremely crowded and even the pool area seems busy when occupancy rates is low. Will be interesting to see the number of peoplemhere when the hotel is fully open. The gyms here are a total joke and not what I expect from supposedly world class hotel. The brilliant views helped to offset an otherwise uncomfortable stay.

I ordered room serivce just for 2 pieces of chocolate cake and it took an hour to deliver . It was just like a poorly furnished apartment but without any additional amentities / necessities to make your stay comfortable. A 5- STARs hotel should have everything in Details.

MBS,1,“Worst 5 Star Hotel in the World / Stay away !”,"In short for those we are in a hurry..We had high expectations of Sands Casino as we thought Casino hotels often have that extra boost of luxury and good service to entice you to hang around their vincinty as witness in Las Vegas and most hotels in Macau . ABSOLUTELY WRONG ! This hotel is deep down low class from service to furnshing in the rooms to the vanity kit ! It is no way 5 star... someone must have made a mistake here considering the price they charge. The glass panels were oily and stained, looked like noone care about them at all and the lift from the basement to lobby is shabby and dirty.NO PORTERS / FIND YOUR OWN WAY TO HOTEL/ STAFF ARE ABSOLUTELY UNHELPFUL AND UNPROFESSIONALWe took the shuttle from the Airport and upon arrival of the hotel, instead of stopping at the main lobby, the driver drove through the badly maintained back alley and then down to the basement to a small side entrance, with no one in sight. Oh yes there was an empty baggage trolley lying by the roadside for your own use.The driver said to us\ do you need me the help you get the trolley\"" , signalling he is going off otherwise and shall dumped us free and easy in the ugly basement to find our way to the lobby using the trolley... god knows where is it.. Mind you there is only one trolley and if luckily we are the only couple, if there are more than one couple, we may have to fight for the trolley.That really shocked us and we were at a lost and my husband's face changed and sternly said , that would be helpful, considering we have 2 big luggages and 2 big box of gift for friends and have no idea where the lobby is..Noting our change or mood, he led us through some short cut under the escalator to the lift, nearly knocking my head while moving under....The glass lift was dirty with oil stains on the glass panels(not cleaned for weeks) The checking in process was messed up with lots of walking here and there, waiting and confusion and it is indeed not easy to write all of it down, in short again, the staff are ill-informed and unhelpful and very patronizing. Basically nobody really cares if you are here or not.. CHECKING IN = WORST EVERWe arrived around 1 am and only to be checked in to a proper room at 215 am. All in all the best part of thewhole night is the driver, whom has offered to show us the way to the lobby. THE LOBBY = DULL AND UNCLASSYThe lobby looks like they have a budget cut with stained marbles all over (Maybe it is the design ) , too poor to polish the marble flooring, so dull , and the paintings and ornaments looked cheap..nothing the sort like a casino hotel.... THE ROOM = BASIC AND PLAINIf you are expecting some similar experience like that of sort of luxury hotel in Vegas or Casino Hotels in Macau, there is nothing there to dazzle you, the room is very basic furnishing , no frills, Carpet looks cheap, bed is lousy with loose springs and not flat, be prepared to get some backache.. ( Oh, we had paid for a PREMIER room, which is suppposed to be better than the basic class...) Carpet is supposed to be clean considering they are so new but looked like they have been used for quite a while already, thin and worn looking. No complementary drinking water, ... toileteries looked like some 3 star hotel packaging.. . We had asked to check out at 220 am because there was nothing similar to a 5 star treatment from the momemt we stepped into the hotel. And we were told that we will be charged for the first night irregardless of the reasons.We decided at 230 am to check out first thing the next morning although we had booked to stay for 4 nights and never return to this hotel.CHECKING OUT We asked for a feedback from the counter and the form literally reads :\"" Dear Guest, we appreciate your Positive feeback and welcome your Constructive comments.... etc.... Trust that you can imagine the kind of mentality the management has by putting such wordings in their feedback form. We have wrote that if they need some negative feedback for improvement, they may call us. This has totally dampened our spirit to even visit the casino, because i doubt it will be any good under the same management..Well, blessing in disguise, we checked in at the Capella , Sentosa the next day at a fraction more but and i must say, it has lived up to stars fully with excellent service and quality room and amenities. We had a good time there for the next 3 nights.This above is only a summary, there are more issues not detailed here, ,my advice, don't waste your money, for 5 star experience stay at the Hilton, Conrad, Fullerton or Capella even if you want to visit the casino... you will be thankful.""",172

Room was clean as expected, there were few constructions ongoing in the hotel (including the sky terrace). The view to the bay looks OK from the 21st floor, the more expensive your room type the better view you have. I wont recommend the garden view, as what you can see at this stage is construction site. Some of their housekeeping staff are not fluent in English. The hotel looks not 100% ready for operation, the only one that looks ready in MBS is it's casino.

The people may be hard-working, but next time I will stay at the trusted Fullerton. Also, location is pretty inconvenient (even though Singapore is a small place) and not close to MRT. Only if you want to spend your entire time gambling should you go there.""",318
Raffles,1,“Not Ready for Prime Time”,"I would avoid the Marina Bay Sands, at least for the foreseeable future. During my recent four night stay, it was a continuing comedy of errors, including: (1) my placement in a double/double room, even though king rooms were available (I was eventually moved); (2) even on the full 'hot' setting, all I could ever get was warm water in the shower; (3) poorly trained staff. One example: The floor supervisor having to bark orders to her staff--while I'm in the room--on how to perform turn-down service; (4) poor ventilation in the elevators and on certain floors; (5) loud traffic noise in rooms on the golf course/ocean side all day and night, due to a major road that parallels the hotel; (6) limited channel selection (18), although they do have Fox News (rare in Asia); (7) electrical glitches, resulting in occasional power outages in the adjoining expo/convention center; (8) major billing issues. Despite three separate discussions with the front desk, they continued to want to bill me for five nights instead of the four that I was there; (9) poor value. Before staying at the Sands, I spent one night at the Conrad, which was S$25 cheaper, with a higher-quality room and far better service. To be fair, some of the bugs may eventually be worked out, as the staff gets more familiar with their jobs and more of the development is completed (they currently only have the casino, about 20% of the high-end shops and about 35% of the hotel rooms open). The wireless Internet service was free. And the casino is nice, as long as you are comfortable with showing your ID three times to get on and off the floor, and are prepared to pay S$50+ per hand at most tables. Overall, however, I would avoid the Marina Bay Sands, as there are many hotels in Singapore that offer both better service and better value.",168
Raffles,1,“The Absolute Worst!”,"I stayed 6 nights at this hotel recently, having checked in with other delegates for a conference. It was without doubt one of the worst experiences I have ever had! I can forgive normal teething problems (given that the hotel had just opened). However, the problems went far beyond this. Examples are staff who are not trained at all and cannot speak or understand English, no hot water, no telephones, televisions not working, intermittent power failure, water dripping from air vents at reception, key cards not working, 20 to 30 minute queues for taxis, 25 minute wait for check-out, just to name a few. Some guests had to change rooms up to 5 times! The problems were widespread, and throughout the conference the appalling state of the hotel was one of the main talking points. All in all, whether you want to visit the casino, or whether you are attending a conference, there are far better options in the vicinity than this hotel. Avoid it like the plague!",43
Raffles,3,“Beautiful hotel. Staff need training”,"After getting the reservation wrong. Check-in staff argued with us! Fortunately we had a printed version of our reservation as proof. After 90 mins, we got the correct room at 6 pm!! Very disappointing. Not the Raffles I had experienced in the past.",63
Raffles,3,“Anniversary visit”,If you are expecting to get any sleep refuse a ground floor room. Noise above us continued until 2 am when we complained! If you are very rich you can eat in the grill room. Cost us 666 Singapore dollars for 4 people & we didn't have wine/drinks. If you want the experience of saying that you stayed at Raffles then it's great,181
Raffles,3,“Great but no Cigar!”,"The problem with a hotel of Raffles' stature and reputation is attempting to comment on the new without remembering the old. Comparisons can indeed be odious and also unfair but at the end of the day it all comes down to personal taste; for me, today's Raffles would be OK to visit for tiffin (but not really worth the expense to stay, I'm afraid) purely because I knew no better, but having visited the original many times I can't help but get all Proustian for le temps perdu on Beach Road. Sure, there was a lot of genteel shabbiness that is so endearing to the English yet anathema to the Americans (more still the Europeans) that needed swept away to get enough bums in beds, but as the Sling is now manufactured off site in gallon drums (the staff actually refuse to make them individually by hand any more) and the Long Bar - with electronic punkas! - allows in the hoi polloi directly off the street, one has to question cost ($800 a night, for a decent room) versus content.....",110
Raffles,2,"“I expected at a traditional hotel, But …”","I chose Raffles as a hotel to lengthen 1 night stay by myself after the vacation with my friend. I specially expected good hospitality and Butler service to not feel lonely.When a man (he is Butler) introduced by a Japanese staff took me to the room, he has left after only one minute explanation, how to use key and call button and Wifi. Because it was too short time, I thought he wasn't the Butler and another person would came after.A porter having carried baggage, but other Butler did not appear. So many unhappy incident came up.I have been robbed of much happy time by the problems of the key.",200
Raffles,3,“5 Star Look 3.5 Star Experience”,"I checked into the hotel during the Easter break. What struck be first at the check-in is how the butlers speak with an affected accent which is really unnatural and neither here not there - I believe that one can speak good English without having to do that. The first impression was definitely awkward. The suite we had had old floor boards that vibrate violently when walking across the room - to some extent we expected this but the vibrations we quite violent and managed to open the wardrobe door on two occasions. Worst of the experience was the ants in the sugar canister - the sugar was packed in plastic but there were still ants crawling all over - not just 1 or 2 but a whole bunch. We asked for it to be changed but the situation did not improve (it seems that the ants have a nest somewhere in the room). Perhaps the hotel should look more into pest control.The only redeeming part was the bed which was at least clean and generally comfortable. Cut away all the frills about history, the hotel pales in comparison with some of their other brand names around the same area. ",56
Raffles,3,“Mr Burton”,"I dont intend to repeat the feedback I have submitted to the hotel except to say the the building, cleanliness,and most staff are excellent.Te eating experience fell well below our expectations in terms of quality of service and the poor standard of porridge at breakfast and average eating experience of high tea in thr Tiffin room",685
Raffles,2,“A great disappointment unfortunately.”,"My wife and I came to be staying at Raffles as part of a 23 day trip to SE Asia. We began in Singapore, staying at the superb Ritz Carlton, and returned to Singapore for what was planned to be a 4 day grand finale at Raffles. Unfortunately it didn’t quite work out like that - our stay at Raffles was a great disappointment indeed, resulting in us checking out two days early.Whilst I do not wish Raffles and its staff and management any harm there were certain aspects of our stay that some people who are considering a stay here may wish to be aware of. The good -The colonial history is clearly evident and interesting (as are some other hotels around Asia). The charm and courtesy of the staff throughout the hotel was immediately apparent and welcome, but perhaps no more so than we have found in many top hotels in Asia.The management of the hotel were most gracious in arranging an early check in for us and greeting us on our arrival – we were very appreciative of this – thank you very much to those involved. The breakfast was one of our favourites we have enjoyed anywhere – excellent quality & very well presented and served.And now, unfortunately, the not so good :-CONSTRUCTION WORKThere is significant building taking place in Beach Road, immediately adjacent to the Palm Court area of the hotel that we had chosen. It is VERY noisy, from 8am until 7pm, six days a week, and I understand that it is going to continue for much of 2014. We found it to be incredibly intrusive, making the terrace/veranda areas outside the rooms largely unusable during the day.(Forget sitting on terrace sipping Singapore Slings) POOR CONDITION OF THE ROOMAs some others have noted some areas of the room, particularly the bathroom, are in pretty poor condition. There was a very significant build up of black mould in the shower, together with perished plastic seals, again with much mould and dirt. As a result, when showering, significant volumes of water poured onto the floor of the bathroom, soaking the towels and generally creating a pretty disgusting environment. We managed to get some of this partially attended to but we were appalled that we had to act as the inspectors of the standards of cleaning & maintenance in the hotel. I am not exaggerating – this was REALLY bad and completely unacceptable.(NB other guests have posted photos of these poor standards on Tripadvisor so I won’t add to this).FUNCTIONSOn our second morning we found out by chance that :-- The Long Bar Grill, Bar & Billiard Room and Patio Bar were closed to guests all day.- Various courtyards, including the Patio, were to be closed for functions- We were informed that around 800 non residents guest were going to descend on the hotel to attend three separate functions.Walking around the hotel it immediately became apparent that this was a really big deal. Large volumes of sound gear were being delivered and erected in the courtyard areas (behind our room) and groups were assembling in various areas, planning the events, vocally executing photo shoots etc (one of these directly outside our room).This was only 9.30am and we had seen enough. We made the decision that we needed to get out of this hotel and we checked in to the Ritz Carlton again (and had a superb stay).This review is more in sorrow than in anger and I believe it to be factually correct and objective, not a rant.We met some very nice staff in the hotel (Leslie, the hotel historian for one – what a very lovely man indeed) so it is a great shame when guests leave the hotel early, largely remembering the negatives. At another time we may, like some others on here, have had a very different experience, but on this occasion our stay was, regrettably,very unenjoyable.I did communicate with the General Manager, who I believe understood our position and concerns, however in fairness to him, there was very little that could have been done to retrieve the situation.",147
Raffles,3,“Needs Refurbishing!”,"This hotel was probably very charming in the late 19th and early 20th century. However this is 2014 and it just doesn't cut it anymore. We stayed in one of the author suites on the first floor. The room was large, with antique furnishings and plumbing to match! The cold water only worked in one of the two sinks, and the drains gurgled when the water was in use, and the toilet had to be flushed on a very specific angle or it wouldn't flush. Also 1987 called and they want their TV's back!The price of drinks in Singapore in general is high, but for 2 martinis, and 1 double vodka at the Long Bar the tab was $153.00 (Singapore dollars) that is about $120 US for the weakest drinks imaginable.Some good news: The service was wonderful and people most friendly, and the breakfast was very adequate.",99
Raffles,3,“Rooms need an upgrade”,"Stayed at Raffles for three nights on the way back from the Maldives to Sydney and stayed in a palm court suite. The history of Raffles is obviously amazing as is the building itself. Reality is however, the rooms, certainly the palm court suites anyway, are in need of an upgrade. Room & bathroom were ok but tired. Technology i.e. TV, phone etc were very old. The furniture shuddered loudly as you walked around the room, floor boards must need some replacing. So overall, given the cost, until the rooms are upgraded, I wouldn't recommend Raffles to other travelers.",207
Raffles,2,“Extremely Disappointing”,"We have stayed here on quite a few occasions. We will not be staying again.It's a beautiful hotel to look at, which is the only reason I did not rate it lower. My husband wanted to give it a negative 10.The beds used to be so incredibly comfortable, that I was determined to discover the brand this time. No need, as they are not the same, or perhaps not made up the same way. They are far too hard -no sinking into a dreamless sleep now. The pillows are a mixture of feather and foam and like limp rocks.The TV was from the last century. Really.Many of the hotel restaurants were closed for lunch, so we went to the Hyatt, which was superb with great service on the Mezzanine.To top it off, upon entering our courtyard suite, the odour was offensive. It could have been damp or drains, either way it smelled of urine. Keeping the bathroom door shut helped. When we arrived it was late and we were exhausted or we would have checked out. Even the Butler seemed to get a whiff, before regaining her demeanour.So disappointing to arrive with confidence and then rush to leave.What happened to the standard of this once reliable icon?",131
Raffles,2,“Very Disappointing”,"I have wanted to stay at this hotel for years but was very disappointed. The hotel building is amazing but can for the most part be visited as a tourist - the rooms are ok, but not well maintained, the plastic trim on our TV was broken and the TV itself v old. The service is at best average. There is a lovely rooftop pool, but again the service is poor. The food poor to average - I have allergy related dietary requirements (gluten and dairy) and had to insist very hard that they accommodate my requirements - the suggestion at breakfast be that I eat fruit and eggs! Compared to other similar hotels that I have stayed at around the world - Raffles is awful and I would not return.",1607
Raffles,2,“SO SAD - SO BAD”,"As a Doctor and a very well traveled person I expected to go to Singapore. However after an unfortunate accident I was left disabled, unable to work and reliant on large amounts of medication and a wheelchair (although able to transfer on crutches) . My great Uncle would tell me stories of sitting in Raffles sipping the famous Singapore Sling and the bar where you throw your peanut shells on the floor. My 50th Birthday just happened to coincide with a big family event in the USA – an event beyond my capacity. However as a special gift I was treated/used my savings on a trip to Singapore with my dear friend.Originally the cost of staying at Raffles seemed beyond reach – however when Trip Advisor sent a reduced rate/deal for Singapore Hotels through we decided it was worth the extra and we booked for 4 nights – as we were to get the last night free!Arrangements were made by my family as they had heard about getting chauffeur transfers and thought it would be helpful and enjoyable treat for my 50th. This was the first of the disappointments – arriving tired and sore at the airport no sign with our names on it. After a while we phoned and were told haughtily as far as Raffles was concerned no such arrangement had been made and we had to get there ourselves.When we checked in, this issue came up and the receptionist acknowledged that in fact Raffles had been contacted about my 50th and the airport pickup but that ‘my family had not gone about making the airport transfer booking correctly’. What? We were too tired to suggest that they possibly could have been told this! The next issue – we have you for 2 nights. What? No our booking was definitely made for 3 nights plus the 1 free night. No budge on that either – our delightful butler (polite and professional) later went to try correct this issue and returned with a piece of calculator paper with 3100 on it. I asked what this was. This was the amount for the next 2 nights. Wwhhaaatttt? Is this to move to one of the extra-special suites? No, this was to stay in our current courtyard suite room for 2 more nights. (We had booked on a rate of $430p.n. inc breakfast). So we were left with having to find another Hotel to move to but at least we were at Raffles for my 50th!There was no fault with our courtyard suite – aside from some of the bathroom – that later. But most importantly the beds were very comfortable and the linens pristine, the decor tasteful and thoughtful. Aside from the spooky plumbing noises we slept very soundly.For ease we had breakfast outside our room in facing across from the courtyard square – the trees provided some privacy but we did begin to rue not having any other outlook or sense of distance. Service was impeccable and we were well treated. My powerchair broke down first morning as we left to explore – no one came to our aid despite attempts to get help until we were nearly back at our room. We found out that our only hope was to hire a power scooter – this wasted the best part of these precious two Raffle days after the concierge/receptionist mislaid the message from the repair/scooter hire company. It also meant I was crushed into the child-size only available Hotel wheelchair, the side pushed against the wheel- which was too hard for my friend to push me especially in the heat. We had a booking at the famous Tiffin room for my birthday afternoon tea which we had been looking forward to for weeks (even years). When we got to the room, my friend was still pushing me, no one offered to take over for her, then the worst! Instead of putting us at one of the outside tables at the edge we were shepherded through the massive room to a table ¾ way into and ½ across the Tiffin room this meant that EVERY single table had no choice but to move their chairs or to stand up and make way for us! We were SO EMBARRASSED to inconvenience so many people. Only to get to our table to find that the chair supplied for me was not at all suitable for a disabled person – and then this larger armchair had to be then brought through all the same people. We were then invited to make our way to the Buffet at the far end!! When we informed our waiter that this was not really possible he collected a range of the buffet items for us to choose – but of course it was his selection in addition to the extra tea choices on the table. My friend commented that it made us look very greedy/wasteful, so much ended up uneaten. The sandwiches on the tea rack were all meat/fish, all white bread and all drying out/curling up. We asked for any non-meat options the replacements were good but again white bread and still beginning to dry out. The ‘hot’ dim-sums were very salty and not very hot, the spring rolls were OK, many of the cakes were also not as flavourful/moist as one would have expected. We have had many High Teas in New Zealand which quite frankly have been far superior and considerably cheaper. A few of the mini tarts were good, but then came my surprise Birthday cake which looked lovely–duly accompanied by the (wonderful) Harpist and a few waiters. It all should have been enjoyable but I still felt embarrassed from prior events. We stayed much longer drinking more tea just to not have such a scene again! For a second I thought that Raffles had supplied a birthday cake since it was my 50th etc. No – my girlfriend had purchased it in advance at some cost. It was the worst cake either of us had eaten – yes, chocolate but then it had this layer of what looked like caramel – but was in fact super thick very sour, bitter gelatinous, lemonish stuff.. I love lemon/sour, I like chocolate, I like most things – but this was almost inedible – we in fact just could not eat it despite making an attempt late that night!We had reservations at the much touted Italian restaurant, but when we realised how far my friend would have to push me I agreed to cancel my ‘birthday dinner’ and ordered room service. We had Laksa – which we both relatively enjoyed and a Singapore Sling –after all got to have a SS on one’s 50th – only one arrived which was placed for my friend- and for some reason the message did not quite get relayed about my missing cocktail – so we gave up on mine and I shared a few sips of my friends. Not exactly the birthday we had anticipated!We thought to hell with it let’s go to the other end of the expensive spectrum and booked in at the Marina Bay Sands 5 star Hotel (yes the one with the famous high infinity pool) Everything was different/better from the food, to the incredible views, to the pristine amenities to the disabled services. In the end we were thankful that our Raffles booking was messed up (one of those situations when you think it is negative but ultimately turns out for the best!) We took delivery of the hire scooter as we checked in at MBS – and found out that we could have had it the first day we were at Raffles. In fact within a few hours of our inquiry. All that wasted money & time, unable to go anywhere or do anything - waiting to hear when we could get the hire scooter. We missed so many things due to this major oversight. We cannot get it back, and cannot readily afford to take such a trip again. Very angry at Raffles despite the old world charm my 50th birthday was utterly ruined. The plumbing. Yes I know its old and quaint – so the loud drains etc are part of the experience. However, the mould, missing tile grout/loose tiles , dirty toilet seat hinges are not. My friend eyed the bath and decided she was going to enjoy a nice soak – until she went to run it. Badly stained bath, and shockingly not very clean around the sides, more grime/mould. Even old baths can be restored/kept clean. Little do we know that this was to be a mild experience when it came to the ‘restrooms’. After we had visited the famous Long Bar (could not really leave until we had) and finished checking out we decided to use the bathroom – and was directed all the way round back to the India Rooms opposite the amazing fountain -this is one of the function areas. It was absolutely disgusting! No excuse for the built up filth and the lack of ventilation with strong odours of stale vomit etc -nor when the lavatory seat detaches which is very dangerous with a disabled person. Other women were commenting – several had the option of returning to their rooms to go to the bathroom and did so - I do understand that Raffles never markets itself as a disabled-appropriate Hotel but this was just appalling. It was the kind of experience you expect at some rough roadside garage or pub not one of the best Hotels in Singapore! And regrettably it was the last experience we had at Raffles!",217
Raffles,2,“History is the only thing this hotel has left.”,"We were so excited to move here from the Marina Bay Sands. The bellman was a chap dressed in one of the old Raj costumes, he was a little grumpy perhaps, but cool. The lobby looked original from the late 1800's…wonderful. When they showed us to the room, we were pleased…until…..we heard every footstep from the above room, including their conversation. Well, that wasn't going to work for us being light sleepers. We asked to move to the top floor because of the noise, only to be told that there was only a one bedroom suite available and it would cost another $750 a night!. We had to sleep so had no choice. It would've been nice if they waived the extra charge for the inconvenience. This hotel needs a revamp. The charm does not replace general luxuries that one expects from a hotel of this stature. For example, the room cleaning was very poor. When we were about to check out, we waited almost 30 minutes for a bellman to come and take our bags, in the end we took them down ourselves. The staff in the breakfast restaurant are slow and untrained in customer service. The one positive is the steak restaurant but I would never stay here again. The Makati Raffles is far superior.",76
Raffles,3,“Massive Changes”,"Been twenty five odd years since I've stayed at Raffles, whilst still very nice indeed I did feel the implementation of several shops and 'boutiques' in and around the hotel did take a away to a degree the 'feel' of one of the icons of Singapore. Service was still excellent and room met all expectations but (call me old fashioned) I did feel it was missing that certain something that many years ago made Raffles 'RAFFLES'.",324
Raffles,2,“Grand building but we were humiliated”,"We just arrived home to Sydney after 3 nights' stay at Raffles for our 16th wedding anniversary. We had looked forward to staying in an icon of world hotels. It was, in general, a very elegant institution. However, there was one aspect which we found unpleasant.The building is grand, full of colonial charm. The whitewashed walls, dark floorboards, ceiling fans, long colonnades and quaint courtyards engender a charming ambience of a bygone era. For today's travellers, the hotel is extremely comfortable because of the large rooms, large beds, and most importantly, icy cold air-conditioning, which provides refreshing respite from the oppressive humidity of Singapore.We loved the daily fresh fruit, complimentary shoe-shining, and the evening turn down service. There are some irritations such as lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room, as well as the tiny CRT televisions.For the three nights, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. However, there was one aspect which soured our experience. This hotel is very protective of its exclusive residents, but is unable to identify them in a way which is not offensive. On no less than 3 occasions, as we returned to the hotel, we were eyed suspiciously and judgmentally by the Sikh doorman as if we were trespassing and not worthy of entering the establishment. During the last occasion (only yesterday), he chased us all the way inside and confronted us with the usual \Can I help you?\"" - not with a helpful tone, but an accusing tone. Although we were paying residents of the hotel, his implication was demeaning, and not only did we feel offended, we were humiliated.I can understand the need to keep out the \""riff raff\"", but somehow this hotel (and particularly that doorman) needs to learn how not to humiliate genuine residents. It was a shame that despite the grandeur of the hotel, such treatment of guests was definitely not classy. Unfortunately this is something I will remember for a long time.""",350
Raffles,3,“You have to know what you want....”,"We originally had booked a stay at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore, but I had read a few comments which made me question whether I wanted to stay there. I saw that the Raffles hotel was rated very highly on tripadvisor and they had a promotion at the time we booked our stay so we switched out hotels.There were certainly high points to our stay:1) The staff, The staff are all very welcoming, accommodating and helpful. 2) The history The property takes you back to another time. You walk around the hotel and view the hallways, arches and lawns and its beautiful.3) The breakfast- was very good. There was a feeling of personalized service for a buffet.There are some areas I think you should be aware of:1) The rooms- are historic. If you are expecting state of the art anything then you are in for a surprise. We learned that since the site is considered a historical site the hotel is very limited in what they can actually change. But I found for me personally that the interior was just too historical. The bed was very uncomfortable. My boyfriend tried to sit on one of the side chairs and sunk into the cushion deeply- it was so worn.2) The laundry costs. I sent a large amount of items to be laundered, I was shocked at the laundry cost. It is my fault that I did not examine the costs further before I sent the items to be cleaned but I received what I consider the mother of all laundry bills. It was more expensive to get my items laundered at this hotel then in the Maldives where we proceeded after our stop in Singapore. Our stay at Raffles had some positives, but I would not plan on staying here again until they at least upgraded the mattresses and made some other upgrades to the rooms. I was surprised to find this rated so highly on tripadvisor. We ended up staying t the Mandarin Oriental on the way back through Singapore and the difference between the 2 hotels is quite striking.",233
Raffles,3,“Raffles Singapore - A Big Disappointment”,"200 characters is not enough to document what happened to me during my stay. For those interested, check out my lengthy review at: http://www.epinions.com/review/lodg-Accommodations-Asia-Luxury_Hotel-epi6185/content_631367437956).The building, rooms, lobby, pool, grounds, staff and service were all highly satisfactory so no problems there. Unfortunately I had issues with a leaking coffee machine, which took a couple of days to resolve (and meant I had to move rooms so they could fix it); a plumbing problem - the toilet wouldn't stop flushing, and when the housemaid tried to assist, the handle came off the wall and water gushed non-stop onto the floor till the tech. came to fix it. The control panel in the room had a glitch so it would switch on the aircon when not required and also call the butler on its own. So one night, around midnight, the doorbell rang, with the butler asking what I wanted.Had a bad experience with food - once at breakfast when confronted with a rare chicken drumstick, and then with the fruit supplied in the room: a bunch of grapes had a few rotting ones in the centre.Under the bed heaps of cobwebs were suspended, looked as if it hadn't been cleaned for months/years.While the Manager and General Manager were apologetic and invited me to a free High Tea or North Indian Curry Buffet, I declined.Returned home thoroughly depressed, tired, and badly in need of a holiday.",404
Raffles,2,“Not what i expected”,"I am pleased to inform anyone who travels to Singapore not to stay at the over rated overpriced hotel, we don't get to go to Singapore often and wanted it to be a memory that we could look back on. Sadly it did not pan out that way, as we like to travel around Asia and experience the places we stay, we took the underground from the airport, so arrived at Raffles not looking our best. We were then pigeon holed for our stay, shown to our room which was a downgrade from the one we booked and insulted by members of staff.I wanted to go to the long bar for the world famous Singapore Sling, great idea but after paying a fortune to stay at the hotel i expected a better service, or at least a smile as the bar staff used a pre prepared mixture in a big vat of Singapore Sling placed it into the shaker and served it up calling it there hand made world famous Singapore Sling, then they had the nerve to charge you 32 SPD for it. Oh and the only way to get to the bar was past all the over priced outlets stores and tacky tea towels and rubbish from the hotel shop.To cap it all i understood that our rooms had an outside area that was not private, but ours had a view of the main street, which was pointed out to us by the hotel manager whilst he informed some other guest that this was the cheap seats and they had a much better view than us. We returned to our room after a long day visiting the sites to find a young girl running all over our outside area and sitting at our table and chairs, the parents doing nothing as we looked on trying to suggest that we had payed good money for your rotten child to be running around our area, when we heard from the hotel manger his thoughts on our view, not even an apology.I will never pay to stay there, we spend the rest of our stay in the Days hotel. The service was better then the Raffles, the staff were polite, nothing was a problem and it only cost us 75 SPD to stay there not the 1100 SDP they charge at Raffles, make your own mind up but heed this warning, don't expect too much",474
Raffles,3,“Relaxing old world charm with good (but not great) service; guest suites require some maintenance & modernisation.”,"My second stay at Raffles, again relaxing and enjoyable. Staff are attentive, and service on average is good. There are certainly enhancements to the suites required to elevate them to the standard now expected of premium hotels, however even without this the hotel offers something many cannot –colonial era history (and they know that is their differentiator). Assuming you get a competitive rate, I’d still recommend a visit as there is nowhere quite like it. More detail should you wish...Arrival:Having booked the S-Class transfer, with Jet-Quay meet-and-greet at the air bridge, the transfer to the hotel was swift and efficient – with in-suite check-in. As of July 2013 the cost was $220 SGD for the car, and $275 for the additional Jet-Quay service (plus tax). On check-in, there was no recognition as a returning guest (poor for hotels of this class).Grand Hotel Suite:The positives: Located in the main building, the Grand Hotel Suite was spacious (with ~5 metre ceilings), and separate parlor, lounge, washroom, bedroom, bathroom, two entrances and a very large private balcony. A second bedroom can be connected as required. See photos. The Suite’s furnishings were in keeping and the bed was comfortable, albeit a Queen and not a King. The butler service was personal and attentive. There was complementary Wifi throughout the hotel. The toiletries were Penhaligon.The negatives: Whilst the period aesthetics are excellent, the Suite was in need of modernising with a number of the fixtures and fittings tired, along with the paintwork – most notably the celings. See photos. There was no in-house pay-per-view movie system. Note, I was kindly upgraded from a Courtyard Suite due to some issues. In all, whilst the Suite was nice – at rack rate at least – is grossly over-priced at ~$8800 SGD/night for what it offers, particularly compared to another Colonial era hotel, the Peninsula Hong Kong, in which I recently stayed. Dining, Bars, Public Areas & Spa/Pool:General – the main foyer is stunning, and provides an exceptional first impression. The hotel gardens are beautifully maintained and it is easy to forget you’re staying in central Singapore. Both are residents-only areas. For reviews of the Tiffin Room High Tea, and the Billiard Room, please refer to my separate reviews.Breakfast in the Tiffin Room – whilst the food selection and quality remains high, service has declined since my last stay. E.g. unused place settings not being removed, incorrect coffee order served, napkins not refolded, no tea pot provided (tea instead poured from a communal pot). All fairly minor, but given the hotel's reputation and rack rate I expected a premium service.Hotel Spa – provided a reasonable selection of treatments; the massage was good. The roof-top pool and bar area was pleasant.Writers Bar (a small residents-only bar in the lobby) – pleasant, with excellent service, however has a rather limited selection for evening drinks.",115
Raffles,2,“Go elsewhere with your money”,"Singapore has too many 5 star hotels to choose from. Don't bother with the Raffles Hotel.We arrived 1230 am after a 20 hr flight from Houston. I had arranged adjoining rooms over 10 months in advance. We arrive and find out that the kids are going to be in a room in another building! The only alternative was for me to rent a huge suite! Absolutely ridiculous. We traveled all over Asia and otherwise had no issues with any hotels. In fact, the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai has been the best hotel in which we have ever visited.Stay at the Ritz or other places in Singapore.Overpriced with no serviceI will not ever go here again",349
Raffles,3,“No value for money”,"I can not go to Singapore and not stay at the Raffles, I thought to myself. Well, I should have gone to tripadvisor first, sort out the reviews from the lowest ratings and read up on it before I booked. I can go on and on but so many other reviewers put it so succinctly I can only recommend checking them out before you decide spending so much money on a hotel that is not worth the value. Yes, the building itself and its surroundings are breathtaking. Yes, the history of it makes it very special and as a books junkie gave me the thrill. Yes, the ambiance is there. But as many other hotels Raffles forgets that customers are not stupid enough to confuse outdated with classic/traditional! The bathroom had a tired décor, knobs in the bathtub falling off, no tea/coffee facilities in the room, the old tv’s from the nineties are another disgrace and so on and so on. So many unacceptable details that urgently need a refresher/refurbishment and clearly aren’t due to savings and not care about the history. On the contrary to many reviews, the service was friendly and professional – no wow factor, but no complaints, exzcept for one strange situation in the restaurant. We came over and were told it was too late to sit down and have a la carte dinner. While we were leaving, a chef approached us and asked why we were leaving so fast. I explained the situation and he said that we will most definitely be served dinner from the menu and asked us to return to the table. We did and the waitress approached us again, however she could not understand why we were back. I quoted the conversation I had with the chef a moment ago and she ran off to discuss this with someone. At the end we were still not able to eat there and had to find someplace else. Total lack of communication and definitely not a 5 star experience.Overall, your money is spent better elsewhere. What a shame and waste of potential.",142
Raffles,2,“The old lady needs major nip and tug!”,"Rooms with hardly and daylight, outdated airconditioning regulator capable only of either freezing cold or tropical humid! Accordingly smells the room and the pillows. TV is from 1991 and they are proud of it! \We wanted to keep the classic look\"" Sure! Too stingy to renovate that is! Wifi and mobile reception does only work if you open the door, step outside and connect. Nice exercise they might think, but I find it annoying, unprofessional and outdated! If you ask for 1.000 S$ per night at least provide proper connectivity in the rooms! I had to move the room in the hope to get better connected but had the same problem in the 2nd room, eventhough I had told them the reason why I had to move! Get a facelift old lady or you will die out together with your aging clientele!!""",153
Raffles,2,"“Raffles is no longer an hotel, but a brand to make money”","We spent 4 days in december and were very disappointed by the hotel, except the nice swimming pool. Room was very noisy: we had to change room because of too much noise from neighbors upstairs. There was a small TV with few channels, correct bathroom, good bed, minimalist and very sober decoration. But the worst of all is service: we are supposed to have excellent majordomo service but we rang the bell many times and ... still waiting for someone to help us ! We then arranged our change of room with reception and an angry steward came to show our new room and didn't help us with luggage: incredible !Breakfast is good, the bar is excellent and it seems that Raffles believe more in their restaurants, bars and the shops of their mall rather than in the hotel.Then better for you just to taste the bar and take pictures in the hall...",792
Raffles,3,“Oh dear - Raffles management what have you done!”,"We were so looking forward to our 3rd visit to Raffles to finish off our two week tour of the Far East, but what a let-down. Bearing in mind they knew we were return guests (I told them in an email I'd sent prior to leaving the UK to book Tiffin, which they acknowledged), I expect a hotel of this quality to say \Welcome back to Raffles Mr xxxxxxx\"" when checking in. But no, we were greeted with \""Is this your first stay at Raffles?\"" Not a great start. As usual we were escorted to our suite by the personal valet, very nice young man he was too, so no initial problems there. Palm Court Suites used to be the ones to have, but the little things that made our prior visits that much more pleasant are now missing/faulty. Aircon didn't work in the the main bedroom area, it hits you like a snowstorm when you enter through the main door, but the cool air doesn't circulate to the bedroom and at night-time the ceiling fan is so noisy you can't have it on to cool things down. So overall, an awful sleep on all three nights we were there. There isn't, and as far as I am aware has never been, any tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, so you still have to call room service and pay an outrageous amount of money just for a cup of tea. The turn-down service used to be a really nice touch, but they have taken away the lovely old-fashioned slippers and replaced them with cheap and cheerful ones that you would get in a 3 star hotel. They no longer leave small gifts and \""writer's readings\"" on the bed either, well that's a small fib, we got one on night one, but that was it. The toiletries are no longer from the lovely Amrita Spa, they seem to have changed to a cheaper alternative. The TVs in the room are from the 1990s, no LCD/HD/LED stuff here! The ice-bucket was never refreshed after day one, I had to order one on day two and it was still sitting there half-full of water when we checked out on day three, as was a tray of tea/coffee cups from day two. The balcony outside our room was re-painted the second day we arrived, but no warning signs were left out, just a length of masking tape stuck to the balustrades, which was easily missed if you were a little short-sighted! Tiffin Restaurant was almost empty the night we used it, I certainly didn't need to pre-book! And although the Indian buffet selection is still excellent in taste and selection, I'm not sure it is worth £40 a head. By the time we added a bottle of champagne, a bottle of wine, four beers and some water, it came to £450 for the four of us. The world famous Singapore Slings are a total rip-off. Doesn't matter where you have one - in the Long Bar or at the residents Writers Bar, they are still almost tasteless and the glasses are just full of ice. £60 for 4 slings too - so not cheap. In all honesty, we had a much nicer Sling served at the bar in the Heritage Suites Hotel, Siem Reap, the night before we arrived in Raffles. It was made by a young Cambodian bar waitress, and hers knocked the spots off the ones made by Raffles. Cost - $4!! Yes - £2.60!Raffles used to have a manager's cocktail evening for residents, but no longer. Shame, as this was a great evening which enable you to meet the management team and chat for an hour or so about the history of the hotel. More cutbacks!The famous old Billiard Room, which used to be a smoking room too, is now a buffet restaurant. We went there expecting to be able to have a quiet after-dinner drink, but it shut at 10pm and we were directed to the Long Bar. Arrived there and it was pandemonium! Full to the rafters with tourists drinking the watered-down Slings. Check-out day I spoke to our valet about the changes that the Management had made to Raffles and how deeply disappointed we were, and he did tell me the likely reason why things hadn't gone too smooth of late. However, I promised I wouldn't repeat what he said, but it certainly makes sense what he said. Regrettably, that will be a our last visit to Raffles. I appreciate they have to try and keep up with the competition but in my eyes the management have gone about it in the wrong way. Bring back the Raffles of old and we would return, but I can't see that happening.""",457
Raffles,3,“Less a Raffle(s) more a Lottery”,"We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of a 6 week trip to Australia and New Zealand, Business class flights and 5* hotels all the way, friends of ours joined just for this leg and it was all a bit of a let down. Our welcome and checkin was very efficient and the explanation of our Courtyard room was very detailed. The fact that this is a rustic building with memories of the Empire is no excuse for the room interiors to be in dire need of attention. The spacious bathroom had heavily chipped washbasins and surrounds and a shower that was hardly big enough. Re-planning could accommodate an ultra modern facility with wet room without any detraction.The Tiffin Restaurant, bars and Long Bar Steakhouse are full of character but not once in our 4 days did staff manage to get through our breakfast order without at least one error, poor. Dinner at the Steakhouse was excessively expensive and when we declined Champagne for Gin and Tonic the Sommiliere through a hissy fit but got his own back telling us that the wine we ordered was out of stock but suggested a replacement at $50 more expensive. Not our fault but no offer of the same price.We had lunch at the about to be launched Italian Coutyard, barstaff with no personalty or conversation. My friend ordered a plain pizza with prawn topping and got a seafood pizza. The order was corrected but we were charged the higher price \ because it will upset our system \"". The mistake was corrected on checkout.The Long Bar is an experience not to be missed but on our last night the whole of the ground floor was closed off \"" for tourists \"". When we said we were resident this cut no ice and we had to sit on the first floor next to the excellent but loud group. Our compensation was a plastic, make your own Sling shaker.Checkout was a rigid midday with no room extention because no rooms were available. A double check with the Duty Manager revealed that rooms were available at a special discounted price. Why is it when flights depart late evening there is no such facility for room extensions which never seem to be a problem with US hotels. Our friends did get a slight extension which almost ended in disaster when they had to rescue their luggage being mistakingly loaded into another clients transport.We left with the distinct expression that The Raffles is doing you a favour by allowing you to stay with them and that there are still many many people in this world who are potential customers and thus it doed not matter to them if you only visit once.""",189
Raffles,3,"“Outstanding service, expected more from the rooms”","I have mixed feelings about our 2 night stay at Raffles. The service provided was faultless and staff are very well trained to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. The hotel itself is stunning, the gardens are immaculate and if I was rating on these two factors alone, Raffles would be 5 star without doubt. What I was disappointed with is the quality of the suites. We were booked into a Raffles Stateroom, and whilst the room was spacious, the bed really comfortable and a lot of the furniture beautiful, there were many signs of poor maintenance in the suite and it was looking a bit 'tired'. The TV was from he early 1990's. Also, whilst there were plenty of options for breakfast, some food was not of high quality ( stale bread) and I would not recommend ordering eggs benedict- it was indelible. The fruit however was beautifully presented and very fresh. Overall, I'm pleased to have experienced Raffles, we did enjoy our stay over all, however for the price, I have to say that we would choose a different 5 star hotel next time we visit Singapore.",102
Raffles,3,“Public areas are as busy as Disneyland”,"Yes, delightful room (albeit with slightly outdated technology). And yes, a slice of history. However, there are areas of the hotel which are open to the public and you may as well get in queue for the ride. The pool is a rooftop, guest only small area. The famous Long Bar is really packed with tourists ordering Singapore Slings (which seem to be made up in big batches and are sickly sweet). All in all I think perhaps one could take the tour and stay elsewhere, for the price I imagine one could enjoy equal luxury in a less crowded petting zoo.",353
Raffles,2,“Great Expectations”,"Having meticulously planned and arranged my idea of a perfect reunion with my husband after a long time apart, i was left feeling very disspaointed with my stay. Our first night was definitley ruined from my side (it was a secret from my husband) when we were shown into what can only be described as a \room\"" when i had specifically booked a Courtyard Suite. Apparantly it was an \""upgrade\"", I don't think so! We were moved to a room in the main building upon arrival which had a window at the top of the door and a balcony. The light from the main foyer made our room as bright as daylight and I appreciate that the outside lights stay on for the effect from the street, but it shone through the curtains. Oh and as for the clock chiming on the hour and in between.....need i say more?I can honestly stay it was the worst nights sleep I have ever had in an hotel.I was told we had been upgraded from my request for a Garden / Courtyard Suite, I would definitely not class this as an upgrade. I specifically requested a courtyard Suite for the extra space due to having a young child with us, and the room we were \""upgraded to\"" did not allow for my husband and I to relax in comfort and reunite after 3 months apart. I specifically asked for a suite with lounge and dining facilities for this very reason. I must say, to be told the room we had been upgraded to was a \""suite\"" was definitley a misnomer. I would suggest \""room\"" would better suit as there was a study, but two wicker chairs on a vernadah with electric lighting did not exactly add to the long awaited reunion.After questioning the reason for the move, I specifically asked to be moved to the courtyard suit I had requested, (it was not offered to me as a solution) I am still very dissappointed that my perfectly planned reunion trip got off to such a bad start. I was in tears for most of the night""",309
Raffles,2,“Very poor for a signature hotel”,"Raffles has the enviable reputation for being one of the best hotels of the world. It's one of the few places where people around the world have on a \to-do\"" list! And not surprisingly it is charged accordingly, it's pretty expensive! Nevertheless we went as a present for my other half for her birthday. We booked into a Raffles Inc room and were told on check in that our room had been upgraded to a suite...... very nice... only to be told that the room wouldn't be ready for another half an hour. We got some lunch and then went to the room, now I have been fortunate to have stayed in some great hotels (old & new) around the world and I have to say that I was very disappointed with the rooms. We were upgraded and so I'd hate to think what the Raffles Inc rooms are like!! Everything was just so out-dated and looks like it hadn't been touched since the 1950s. The TV in the room was one of the first ever colour tvs and the remote control was held together by sticky tape!! Amazingly there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room either. in this day and age of cheap TVs and cheap coffee makers I'm very surprised at both of these. The beds are very comfortable though which I guess is a positive. The bathrooms were clean but very dated. All in all I'd say that Raffles is relying on it's name as a good hotel and not delivering on that promise with it's rooms. The service is amazing, very efficient and very helpful and the staff know your name everywhere in the building. The common areas are beautiful and in keeping with the colonial look but again it just comes down to them spending a few pennies to upgrade the rooms!""",208
Raffles,3,“An Historic Property that misses the mark!”,"We have stayed at the Raffles Hotel on several occasions, and despite returning to the hotel several times in a month, we were left with the impression that each visit was as if we had never been there before. Despite repeatedly telling staff that we knew the deal, they insisted on running through their routine \blurb\"".We find the rooms dated and in a desperate need of a renovation, our beds have been firm to lumpy and the bathrooms are well and truly still the original deal - with bath tubs that you can barely sit in let alone stretch out in.The hotel also no longer offers 24 check-in, a service they used to offer all guests, but is now only available to Raffles Ambassadors. As such, it is difficult to ever get a room available for early check-in or late check-out.We also believe the value for money offered is diminishing with many other hotels now operating in the immediate vicinity which offer more or less the same experience for less money. If all you are after is a bed for the night, then we recommend you look elsewhere. If you enjoy staying in older hotels with style and full of antiques, then the Raffles may be for you.""",285
Raffles,3,“Not living up to its reputation”,"Because of the reputation of the Raffles and its # 1 rating here on Tripadvisor we decided to celebrate my birthday in the Raffles in Singapore. Regretfully our expectations were not met.Arriving at the airport our transfer was not there almost an hour and some phone calls later there it was, they upgraded the car to make up for it but still we sat there 1 hour waiting in the airport. Our butlers were very nice and helpful and so was the staff at the concierge desk, but even our young daughter noticed the bad mood of the man bringing the suitcases to our suites.One night we had dinner at the hotel in the courtyard, ofcourse we had a Singapore Sling and than they offered us to by the plastic souvenir shaker for 3$, not in line with the style of the hotel in my opinion. During our diner a rat wandered by a few times: My family now explains we were staying in the Rattles!! As s a pleasant surprise for my birthday there was a nice (and tasty) birthday cake as dessert, with singing personnel. Very niceThe next morning at breakfast, the a la carte items take quite some time to arrive, we were just finished and ready to leave there was another surprise: singing personnel and another (the same) birthday cake. Very nice, but it does show a lack of coordination.In front of our room a dove dropped an egg on 2 of the 3 nights we stayed, which of course can happen, but putting our doormate over it and only cleaning ut up hours later cannot.After all, we had a nice weekend but next time we will definitely book another hotel.",138
Raffles,3,“Service great but truly requires some updating!!!”,"I was totally impressed with the attentive and alert service of this hotel. I stayed at one of the suite on the 3rd floor, I must say as nice as it is, there quite a few updating needed for this hotel.The bell service bottom does not really work, air-conditioner' temperature is hard to adjust, the bathroom is a disgrace for hotel of this statue. The ceiling is in need of repainting as some of the paint were coming off, and it appeared very bad visually. I went to the pool and used the steam room. It was left quite untidy with the previous guest, hair all over the floor, and the wet towel left on the bench. They did come quickly to clean the steam room given their very good service quality, but I was a bit disappointed.",150
Raffles,3,“outdated”,"Raffles Hotel should be the best hotel in Singapore. Well it is certainly not. Rooms are way outdated, bathrooms are a disgrace, aircon either too cold or too hot, switches unreadable, in room coffee machine produces lukewarm coffee at best. I'll explain.... 21 \ square box TV x 2 , no rain shower, green color bathroom (not the best color for any woman's complexion), overused faucets, spritzly shower (if you don't understand read Conrad Hilton's book), under polished brass knobs and a cooling system out of the 90's.Service is good. No problem there. But I don't want 20th century hospitality. Time to rejuvenate the old lady once more. And oh yes.... even the coffee at the writer's bar (while waiting for the room ) is very lukewarm.... may be a bit of limescale in the equipment...At that price there are other choice, even with less anachronic charm but better comfort.""",199
Raffles,2,“Very disappointing service”,"Our second time staying at this legendary Singapore institution. There is no doubt that the building is impressive and the atmosphere reminiscent of days gone by.We stayed in the Noel Coward Suite, situated on the floor above the function room. A very noisy wedding reception made staying in the room impossible. We were moved to a different room on the other side of the complex, leaving all out belongings in the original room.On returning to the Noel Coward Suite the next morning, we discovered we had been locked out - as a 'security measure', which necessitated us going all the way to reception in dressing gowns. Pretty poor for this standard of hotel. The surly duty manager came to open the door and promised to send up a key. He never returned.This one incident seemed to be indicative of a 'don't care' policy running throughout the service here, where every meeting with a member of staff, whether delivering ice, serving breakfast or answering the phone was preceded with \I'm sorry for the delay....\"".It seems a shame that this hotel's promise of old world service seems to have been left behind in the past.A much better bet is The Fullerton.""",60
Raffles,1,“So Disappointed”,"Given the rich history & tradition I anticipated greatly our stay. Service was poor, inefficient. Over 30 minutes check in, waited 45 minutes for am room service coffee, calling for room service and getting an answering system, etc, etc. No thank you's from staff. Have worked, traveled & lived in Asia for 8 years, so many better places and value.",407
Raffles,3,“Inauspicious start to CNY”,"Arrived in Palm Court Suite to find orange tree with rotting fruits and dead leaves this was pointed out and on returning later it had been stripped of all fruits.Suite 216 is smaller than 213 that we had stayed in on our previous visits with less seating in the bedroom and parlour, and a very small, useless corner bath.The bath room/toilet door did not close due to ill fitting tiles binding on the door .During our stay several ligt bulbs failed and these were never replaced,nor was the bowl of small, dried up mandarin oranges from day three of our stay. Rudyard Kipling would be disappointed how the standards of food have slipped in the Tiffin Room.The breakfast buffet is not as extensive as in previous stays, more dishes have to be ordered but due to less staff these arrived cold.There used to be a waiter patrolling with tea & coffee to keep you topped up now you have to ask for more this is decanted from a large pot and delivered to your table lukewarm With less staff tables were not cleared quickly and Sivam one of the waiters seemed to be on the run all the time.Several residents appeared to be more suitably dressed for the beach rather than breakfast ,if you want to breakfast in shorts, T shirts & flip flops stay at one of the resort hotels!Afternoon tea has also changed for the worse.Instead of the vast array of sandwiches ,cakes , pastries scones and hot dishes on the buffet, It is a \three plate\"" tea with a few other additions.There appeared to be a great deal of wastage from these pre filled plates.Yet again the supply of tea was very poor and the waiter seemed more interested in trying to encourage diners to have either champagne or a sling.At all meal times there was a constant barrage of camera flashes.Why do people need to take a picture of a plate of food,a teapot and a glass of pink fizzy?Since our last visit you are now provided with morning tea in your roomThe Doormen, swimming pool and gardens are just as good.The Lion Dance for CNY outside and in the lobby was excellent.Obviously things do change but sadly it appears not for the better,Raffles has a reputation to maintain . The lack of modern gadgets does not detract from the colonial charm, all it needs to do is restore the standards of before""",102
Raffles,3,“Tourist trap”,This place is crowded with tourists. This is also reflecting in the service. At one time we where stopped at the entrance to the hotel and asked by the door man what he can help us with. After telling him that we where recidences he continiued to ask us what room we where staying in. It was not until I showed him the key to our room that we where let in. This is not the kind of service we are used to. There are far better hotels in Singapore like the Fullerton hotel that we also stayed in on this trip.,252
Raffles,1,"“Overrated, overpriced and overhyped”","I can't imagine that this \iconic\"" hotel of Singapore has been rated so highly. Either I was staying at a similarly named hotel in an alternative universe or some of the raters here have not seen better hotels. For starters, the hotel is rather run down with the last renovation probably done eons ago and that sort of affected the feel of the room. While the rooms are large for a hotel, i would hardly call the small corridor before the bedroom a \""living room\"" - my toilet at home is at least 2x the size of the living room.Many other raters have complimented the hotel on the service but all i received was rather plastic fake smile service. You could just sense the underlying contempt, disdain, disinterest, etc. underneath that well practiced smile (ever notice the eyes make a difference?). It was also frightfully slow, it almost felt like we were back to victorian days where aging male servants ambled to fetch hot water. Management was hardly better but I will leave it for another time.I am rather harsh with my critique I know but this is one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore and not a common run of the mill one. I would have taken this level of quality at another 3/4 stars hotel easily. I travel nearly 200 days a year and have stayed at some top hotels around the world. Raffles Hotel certainly is certainly all fluff when it comes to living up to its reputation.""",164
Raffles,3,“Not that impressed with this hotel - strange setup”,"I was staying at this hotel for 5 nights for a conference. Given I stayed at Raffles hotel before (Cambodia), I had higher expectations of Raffles hotel. The food was nice, the services VERY slow but very warm and attentive and willing but I found the whole hotel a very strange place. To go to a room, you had to go outside and thru a courtyard to a different building. The room was also strange. Extremely large but the layout was unusual. The bedroom was between a hallway and a diningroom/office so it had no window and no natural light as the dining room balcony was shared by all rooms and therefore nobody would open the doors or even the curtains. The whole hotel looked like an old fashion mall. The spa was very small and so was the pool.Tthere were various events and parties in the various courtyards every night. It seemed too busy with tourists wondering the shops downstairs. It lacked privacy.",277
Raffles,2,"“Overrated, commercial tourist attraction, had to be done - once!”","It wasn't all bad - the hotel staff were efficient and the suite great - though expensive. The check in staff were very courteous when we arrived from an early flight and we were able to use the spa to shower until our room was ready - 10am and appreciated. Having spent the night on an overnight flight we thought that the Ah Teng's Bakery might be a quick breakfast stop before exploring - just wanted tea and toast - not possible - toast only came with an egg on the side - could have Danish pastry, muffin or a croissant but not toast - I thought I was at the raffles! Ended up in the Bar & Billiard room (as the Tiffin Room was closed) - it was a Basil Fawlty experience! The spread was impressive it has to said but 'Basil' was reprimanding a young waiter (unnecessarily in our opinion) on three separate occasions which rather spoilt a quiet morning. Uniforms were also soiled. Long Bar - had the ambience of a 'Beefeater' pub - $59 for two Singapore Slings - not shaken or stirred by the barman! There are much better places to enjoy this in Singapore!Breakfast delivered to room next morning very efficient, nothing special. Guest areas of the hotel too limited - the public areas were like Disney - a spectacle - the public areas are trying to maximise profit and this limits the experience of the guests actually staying at the hotel. When you are staying and paying for the raffles do you really expect to pay for Internet access when it is free across the road in the shopping centre?!!!",906
Raffles,3,“High Expectation Big Disappointment”,"My first time to Singapore was about 10 years ago and I went to the Raffles for the curry buffet at the Tiffin Room. In my memory, the place was elegant, the service was outstanding and the food was...simply unforgettable. The opening of the Universal Studio drew me to this country again and my hotel choice was, of course, the Raffles!When we found out the guy who greeted us outside the arrival gate was also the driver and he left us waiting at the curb in the hot climate when he went to the parking lot to retrieve the car (a Mercedes Benz), I had a bad feeling about this. No cool towel nor bottled water was offered after we had settled inside the car. The driver made a call to the hotel minutes before our arrival but no one was waiting at the front door. It was a below standard pickup service. It was different on our way back to the airport. We had a nicer car (a BMW) with little Raffles flags in front. The driver was in the Raffles uniform (the other guy was in a white shirt only) and there were bottled water as well as cool towel inside the car. So I guess they must have run out of car and driver on the day of our arrival and the guy who picked us up could be just an outside help. However, we consider service offered to guests should not be any different even if it was performed by an outsourced party.We requested the Noel Coward Suite just to compare with the one we stayed when we were at the MO Bangkok. To be honest, we were disappointed with this room which was also named after the same author. Except a few items reminding you the famous author, there was no character about this room. There were a small tube TV and a CD player. The bathroom actually looked old instead of nostalgic. The staff who did our check-in inside the room also showed us where everything was. The butler was not there to greet us and there was no welcome drink.Talking about the butler or butlers, they did leave a welcome note inside our room. We ran into one (the note was from 3 persons) when we went out and we asked her to make the king size bed into Hollywood Twin at turndown. She said no problem but it was not done when we were back later at night. We pressed the butler call button. Instead of seeing one of the butlers, we received a call asking what the issue was about. In fact, every time we used the button, we received just a call from someone. We thought we may as well call the front desk instead. The butler service was non-existence.We had the famous afternoon tea on our first day. There was a choice of full buffet or just a high tea set and we went for the whole experience. When we arrived at the Tiffin Room, we saw a 3-tier tea set with cream puff, lemon tart and assorted finger sandwiches on every table already. The sight of it was totally unattractive. Some guests arrived much later and the food they had was being left on the table for more than half an hour already. Furthermore, food at the buffet was not good in quality either.We also tried the international buffet at the Bar and Billiard Room. It was a busy restaurant but they reserved a nice table for us. Service was attentive but the food was nothing worth to be mentioned.We visited the Long Bar twice and we truly enjoyed the legendary Singapore Sling. An earlier review here mentioned the drink was a pre-mixed. When we were there, we saw bartenders busily mixing one after another. The tapas were delicious too. The second time we went were after 9:00pm and there was live music on the upper floor. Staff at the bar were very friendly and service was great. We had a good time there.Before we left for the airport, we went for the memorable curry buffet. The food was still as good as what I could remember and the service again was great. However, the waiter served our champagne in a wine glass. We asked why and he told us that they serve red/white wine and champagne with the same glass except at the Raffles Grill, which is their fine dining restaurant. This may be an acceptable standard inside the Raffles but certainly not anywhere else in the world. A big minus to the otherwise satisfying dining experience.During our stay, the lobby was oddly quiet as they prohibited visitor to get inside the hotel lobby. They even put up signs at the entrance say \RESIDENTS ONLY\"" to stop all non-hotel guests. We saw nicely dressed people queued up in the courtyard waiting to get inside the Tiffin Room for afternoon tea. Staying at the hotel, we entered the restaurant through the entrance at the lobby. This may be a good policy to protect the privacy of the guests but the atmosphere there was a bit strange, especially during daytime when no one was playing the piano at the Writers Bar.We highly recommend a visit to the hotel museum on the third floor of the shopping arcade. The museum is opened to everyone and there are many interesting times from the past to look at.""",76
Raffles,3,“way over priced”,for 1000 sing a night i stayed here for 4 nights and for what i was paying and what i was getting was not happy at all maybe if your in your late 50's and over this hotel i checked out after the 4th day and went to the hard rock hotel and found service the same rooms where nicer more modern the only down side of the hard rock is the lack of food selection,487
